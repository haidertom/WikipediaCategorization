{{Distinguish|AIDS Education and Training Centers}}
[[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|200px|thumb|A red ribbon is often used to signify the fight against AIDS]]
[[AIDS]], caused by the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), has become a global health issue, and various ways are being explored in order to combat the spread of the [[disease]]. One such way to somewhat limit the spread of AIDS is through [[education]]. Societies with significant number of HIV positive individuals and people that have been diagnosed with having cases of AIDS are societies in which education about the disease is limited to almost non-existent and where culture and [[tradition]] clash with [[modern medicine]]. Thus, education and training are of great importance and a number of organizations have been formed within the past two decades. Organizations vary from being government funded to private and/or are formed by health and social advocates. Organizations provide range of services from support for families and individuals affected by the [[disease]], classes in academic settings ranging from preschools to universities, available resources to updates on the latest advances in medical treatments.

In many societies, even in many [[Western cultures]], stereotyping exists and one way to stop or prevent [[discrimination]] is through education and passing out information about the ways the disease is spread. Big problem in containing the spread of the disease are cultural and religious backgrounds where usage of common [[contraceptives]], such as [[latex condoms]], are prohibited. Unfortunate events such as wars and armed conflicts often employ [[rape]] as a mean of terrorizing local population, in which AIDS, among other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs), is spread almost exponentially and, very often, it is impossible to trace back to the individual that was the original HIV carrier.  The consequences of such horrific acts are infected mothers who give births to infected babies and the disease is spread vertically. Because of its impact on global population and the high rate of spreading, AIDS has been classified as being [[pandemic]].

There is a growing number of organizations exclusively dedicated to AIDS education and prevention, as well as organized training of medical staff and any individuals that may be interested. Main goals of these organizations are:
* Education about the disease (acquisition and transmission process) 
* Training 
* Support
* Updates on latest research efforts

'''Anna L. Peterson''' (born 1963) is an American scholar of [[religious studies]] who is currently a [[professor]] in the Department of Religion at the [[University of Florida]], where she has worked since 1993. Her research variously concerns [[religion in Latin America]] and [[ethics]]—including [[religious ethics]], [[Christian ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[animal ethics]] and [[social ethics]]. She is the author of five monographs: ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' ([[State University of New York Press]], 1997); ''Being Human'' ([[University of California Press]], 2001); ''Seeds of the Kingdom'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2001); ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009); and ''Being Animal'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).

==Career==
Peterson studied at [[Williams College]] (1981–1983) before going on to receive a [[religious studies]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1983–1985). She then studied at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1986 to 1991. She received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1987, and a [[doctorate|PhD]] in Ethics and Society in 1991. Her doctoral [[thesis]] was supervised by Robin Lovin.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Peterson, Anna L. [http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/religion/files/2012/11/Peterson-CV1.pdf CV]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;"[http://people.clas.ufl.edu/annap/ Anna L. Peterson]". [[University of Florida]]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[assistant professor]] in religious studies at [[St. Norbert College]] in 1991, where she remained until 1993, when she took up the position of assistant professor at the [[University of Florida]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1997, her ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' was published with [[State University of New York Press]]. The book blends [[theology]], [[social history]] and [[ethnographic]] [[anthropology]] to explore ideas of [[Catholic]] [[martyrdom]] in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Cornelia. (1998). "''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion: Progressive Catholicism in El Salvador's Civil War''. By Anna L. Peterson". ''Journal of Church and State'' '''40''' (3): 696–7. {{Doi|10.1093/jcs/40.3.696}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[associate professor]] in 1998, and spent two years as a [[visiting fellow]] at the [[Wesleyan University]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; 2001 saw the publication of her ''Being Human'', a book about [[environmental ethics]] from the perspective of [[religious ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Susan J. (2002). "[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_9/0602armstrong.html ''Being Human: Ethics, Environment, and Our Place in the World'']". ''[[Journal of Political Ecology]]'' '''9''' (2). {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she became a [[full professor]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Peterson has published a number of books while a full professor at Florida. ''Seeds of the Kingdom'', a comparative study of United States [[Amish]] farming communities and of El Salvador's refugee communities, appeared in 2005. Both groups examined, Peterson argues, attempt to build [[utopian]] Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;McKanan, Dan (2007). "Anna L Peterson, ''Seeds of the Kingdom''". ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' '''87''' (2): 295–7. {{doi|10.1086/513230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' was published in 2009. In this book, Peterson argues that humans should the extend ethical values dominant in interpersonal relationships, such as love, to differently structure currently instrumental societal and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Rita (2010). "''Everyday Ethics and Social Change''". ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' '''32''' (4): 421–4. {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics201032445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 saw the publication of ''Working Toward Sustainability: Ethical Decision-Making in a Technological World'', a textbook which Peterson co-authored with Charles J. Kibert, Martha C. Monroe, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Kibert, Charles J., Martha C. Monroe, Anna L. Peterson, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele (2012). ''Working Toward Sustainability''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013's ''Being Animal'', Peterson critiques the separation of environmental and [[animal ethics]]. Though frequently thought irreconcilable, Peterson argues that the separation can be blamed on a weak understanding of nature, humans, and animals, as well as the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhall, Andrew (2015). "Anna L. Peterson: ''Being Animal: Beasts &amp; Boundaries in Nature Ethics''". ''[[Ethical Theory and Moral Practice]]'' '''18''' (4): 877–9. {{Doi|10.1007/s10677-015-9560-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==
In addition to her books, Peterson has written over twenty articles published in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journals]] and scholarly [[edited collections]], as well as various [[review articles]], [[book reviews]] and [[encyclopedia]] articles.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

'''Atheism''' is, in the broadest sense, the absence of [[belief]] in the existence of [[Deity|deities]].&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/atheism |encyclopedia=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |title=Atheism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy" /&gt;  In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#1

The etymological root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society,&lt;ref name="drachmann" /&gt; those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh" /&gt; The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitmarsh|first1=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-94877-9 |chapter=8.

== Definitions and types ==
[[File:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the relationship between the definitions of [[Weak and strong atheism|weak/strong]] and [[Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit/explicit]] atheism.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left'''), according to authors such as George H. Smith, would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief.
&lt;br /&gt;
(Sizes in the diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population.)]]

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism" /&gt; contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],&lt;ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /&gt; and has also been contrasted with it.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /&gt; A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" /&gt;

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.&lt;ref name= Nagel1959&gt;{{cite book
|title= Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism

I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. &amp;nbsp;... atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &amp;nbsp;... I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism&amp;nbsp;...}}
&lt;br /&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=:Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

=== Positive vs. negative ===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="presumption"&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature&lt;ref name="presumption" /&gt; and in Catholic apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt; many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,&lt;ref name=Kenny2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html | title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.&lt;ref name=Kenny2006&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-82648971-5 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism&amp;nbsp;... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |authorlink=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archivedate=20 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."&lt;/ref&gt;
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

=== Definition as impossible or impermanent ===
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |title=Atheist Group Moves Ahead Without O'Hair |first=Sue Anne |last=Pressley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=8 September 1996 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |archivedate=22 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic atheism===
Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] life. This view is related to [[apatheism]] and [[practical atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/od/Atheist-Dictionary/g/Definition-Pragmatic-Atheist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
[[File:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th-century advocate of atheism.
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God.  The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref name="hume-metaphysics" /&gt; The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H. H. Price".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&amp;nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

Some atheists hold the view that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].&lt;ref name=logical&gt;{{cite web |author=Various authors |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |title=Logical Arguments for Atheism |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=The Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.&lt;ref name="Drange-1996"&gt;{{cite web |first=Theodore M. |last=Drange |authorlink=Theodore Drange |year=1996 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html |title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reductionary accounts of religion ===
{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]&lt;ref&gt;Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |website= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archivedate=21 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /&gt; One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,&lt;ref name="misconceptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Perhaps the most common criticism of atheism is the claim that it leads inevitably to [[moral bankruptcy]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] argued this view in his ''[[Pensées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]] (1669). ''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&amp;nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&amp;nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

=== Association with world views and social behaviors ===
Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]] analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norris |first=Pippa |first2=Ronald |last2=Inglehart |year=2004 |title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Steve |year=2003 |title=Religion and Politics |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-81-208-0899-7|quote = According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers such as [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek: Less Than Nothing (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain de Botton]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton: [[Religion for Atheists]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist: The Global Empire (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -{{sic}}or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kant CPR A811"&gt;For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&amp;nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).&lt;/ref&gt;
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."&lt;ref name="Fortin &amp; Benestad"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=19ccmx1W58IC&amp;pg=PA16|title =Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good|publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|quote=That problem was brought home to us with dazzling clarity by Nietzsche, who had reflected more deeply than any of his contemporaries on the implications of godlessness and come to the conclusion that a fatal contradiction lay at the heart of modern theological enterprise: it thought that Christian morality, which it wished to preserve, was independent of Christian dogma, which it rejected. This, in Nietzsche's mind, was an absurdity. It amounted to nothing less than dismissing the architect while trying to keep the building or getting rid of the lawgiver while claiming the protection of the law. | accessdate=2011-04-09|isbn = 978-0-8476-8279-9|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craig &amp; Moreland"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=g8bHRrVu3SsC&amp;pg=PA392|title =The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|quote=Morality "has truth only if God is truth–it stands or falls with faith in God" (Nietzsche 1968, p. 70).

Some include [[virtue ethics]], [[social contract]], [[Kantian ethics]], [[utilitarianism]], and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].

and [[Julian Baggini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contemporary British political philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&amp;nbsp;184–5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'', where he argues that the [[Qur'an]] played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] said that "every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness&amp;nbsp;... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".&lt;ref&gt;The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|átheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.&lt;ref name=drachmann&gt;{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.

Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage. In Greek they said ''{{Transl |grc |átheos}}'' and ''{{Transl |grc |atheotēs}}''; to these the English words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely. In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |átheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''atheist'' (from Fr. ''{{lang|fr|[[wikt:athée|athée]]}}''), in the sense of "one who&amp;nbsp;... denies the existence of God or gods",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atheist |title=atheist |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cudworth, Ralph. The true intellectual system of the universe. 1678. Chapter V Section II p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term ''theism'' came to be contrasted with deism.

[[Karen Armstrong]] writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist."{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].&lt;ref name="adevism"&gt;In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

While the earliest-found usage of the term ''atheism'' is in 16th-century [[France]],&lt;ref name="mw-online"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism | title=Merriam-Webster Online:Atheism | quote=First Known Use: 1546 | accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Golding /&gt; ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the [[Vedic period]] and the [[classical antiquity]].

{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the [[historical Vedic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandian |title=India, that is, sidd |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1996 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B90uj14NHjMC&amp;pg=PA64 |isbn=978-8-170-23561-3 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the six [[Astika and Nastika|orthodox]] schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1992 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258 |isbn=978-8-120-80412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227–249. {{ISBN|0-69101958-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:&lt;ref&gt;Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.}}

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]]. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in India.&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title=A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189–206 |doi=10.2307/1397540 |ref=harv |jstor=1397540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not strictly an atheist, Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia—Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as [[Pyrrhonism]]—that nothing was inherently evil, and that ataraxia is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.&lt;ref name="gordonstein"&gt;Stein, Gordon (Ed.) (1980).

=== Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance ===
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]].  Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058).  Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their being relatively prolific writers, little of their work survives, mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim [[Apologetics|apologists]] attempting to refute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Zandaqa Wal Zanadiqa'', by Mohammad Abd-El Hamid Al-Hamad, first edition 1999, Dar Al-Taliaa Al-Jadida, Syria (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent Golden Age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well, although the current intellectual atmosphere in the Islamic world, and the scant evidence that survives from the era, make this point a contentious one today.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]] and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies.  [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" /&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]].  Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref name="gordonstein" /&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] and in the 1720s by the French priest [[Jean Meslier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques-André Naigeon]], and other [[French materialism|French materialists]].&lt;ref name="Holbach-SoN"&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The System of Nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/page/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=1770 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Waldron]]; ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''; Cambridge, UK; 2002; p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&amp;nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&amp;nbsp;...".  But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&amp;nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France|website=adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-754-63456-0 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Holyoake]] was the last person (1842) imprisoned in Great Britain due to atheist beliefs. Law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge.

Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref name=feminism&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |chapter=Feminism and Atheism |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |isbn=978-1-139-82739-3}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=233–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the number of actively anti-religious regimes has reduced considerably. In 2006, Timothy Shah of the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum]] noted "a worldwide trend across all major religious groups, in which God-based and faith-based movements in general are experiencing increasing confidence and influence vis-à-vis secular movements and ideologies."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pewforum.org/2006/07/18/timothy-samuel-shah-explains-why-god-is-winning/ Timothy Samuel Shah Explains 'Why God is Winning']." 2006-07-18.

{{Main|New Atheism}}
"New Atheism" is the name that has been given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that "religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |title=The rise of the New Atheists |publisher=CNN |first=Simon |last=Hooper |accessdate=2010-03-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408094135/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |archivedate=8 April 2010  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- NB: they may also advocate other views---&gt;

In recent years, the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4898/the-rise-of-arab-atheism |title=The rise of Arab atheism|accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In major cities across the region, such as [[Cairo]], atheists have been organizing in cafés and social media, despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A 2012 poll by Gallup International revealed that 5% of Saudis considered themselves to be "convinced atheists."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances.

===Wealth and education===

A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman" /&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the [[Social democracy|social democracies]] of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Barber (2010). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion Why Atheism Will Replace Religion]. [[Psychology Today]]. Retrieved 2013-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States. In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60.&lt;ref name="intmag"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Lynn |last2=Harvey |first2=John |last3=Nyborg |first3=Helmuth |title=Average intelligence predicts atheism rates across 137 nations |journal=[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] |year=2009 |volume=37 |pages=11–15 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000238 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.004 |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.&lt;ref name="Nigel atheists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nigel|title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs: Is Atheism a Sign of Intelligence?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs|publisher=Psychology Today|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors  such as age, education and country of origin.&lt;ref name="Daws"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daws|first1=Richard E.|last2=Hampshire|first2=Adam|title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=19 December 2017|volume=8|pages=2191|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191|pmid=29312057|pmc=5742220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=The Serial Killer Test: Biases Against Atheists Emerge in Study|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=The New York Times|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paris|first1=Agence France-Presse in|title=Atheists tend to be seen as immoral – even by other atheists: study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=the Guardian|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Will M.|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|last3=McKay|first3=Ryan T.|last4=van Elk|first4=Michiel|last5=Buchtel|first5=Emma E.|last6=Aveyard|first6=Mark|last7=Schiavone|first7=Sarah R.|last8=Dar-Nimrod|first8=Ilan|last9=Svedholm-Häkkinen|first9=Annika M.|last10=Riekki|first10=Tapani|last11=Klocová|first11=Eva Kundtová|last12=Ramsay|first12=Jonathan E.|last13=Bulbulia|first13=Joseph|title=Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|date=7 August 2017|volume=1|issue=8|pages=0151|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0151|url=http://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a 2016 [[Pew Research Center]] publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral.

&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Van A. |title=Agnosticism and Atheism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Flynn|2007|p=35}}: "The terms ''ATHEISM'' and ''AGNOSTICISM'' lend themselves to two different definitions. The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&amp;nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|2013}}: "Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons&amp;nbsp;... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God&amp;nbsp;... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers&amp;nbsp;... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., "God" is just another name for love, or&amp;nbsp;... a symbolic term for moral ideals."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|2013}}: "atheism, in general, the critique and denial of metaphysical beliefs in God or spiritual beings. As such, it is usually distinguished from theism, which affirms the reality of the divine and often seeks to demonstrate its existence.

&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Atheism | quote = The term as generally used, however, is highly ambiguous. Its meaning varies (a) according to the various definitions of deity, and especially (b) according as it is (i.) deliberately adopted by a thinker as a description of his own theological standpoint, or (ii.) applied by one set of thinkers to their opponents. As to (a), it is obvious that atheism from the standpoint of the Christian is a very different conception as compared with atheism as understood by a Deist, a Positivist, a follower of Euhemerus or Herbert Spencer, or a Buddhist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Atheism | quote = But dogmatic atheism is rare compared with the sceptical type, which is identical with agnosticism in so far as it denies the capacity of the mind of man to form any conception of God, but is different from it in so far as the agnostic merely holds his judgment in suspense, though, in practice, agnosticism is apt to result in an attitude towards religion which is hardly distinguishable from a passive and unaggressive atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy"&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2005}}: "On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1998}}: "As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God.&amp;nbsp;... an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--ref name=extreme-secularism&gt;{{harvnb|Zuckerman|2010}}: "A major source of these biases is the lack of clear definitions. Atheism and secularity are defined in opposition to religion, with atheism (the rejection of theism) often perceived as an extreme form of secularism (the decline of religious influence over society). But atheism is a narrow term referring to a specific belief (that there is no god), whereas secularism has various meanings, including a range of attitudes (such as religious indifference, doubt, agnosticism, and atheism) as as behaviors (such as lack of regular church attendance or disregard for traditional religious morality)."&lt;/ref--&gt;
&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2006|p=2}}: "But agnosticism is compatible with negative atheism in that agnosticism ''entails'' negative atheism.

I usually reply with a question like, "Well, are you a Republican or an American?" The two words serve different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief. The agnostic says, "I don't have a knowledge that God exists." The atheist says, "I don't have a belief that God exists."

'''BSRIA''' (it takes its name from the initial letters of the '''Building Services Research and Information Association''') is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based testing, instrumentation, research and consultancy organisation, providing specialist services in [[construction]] and [[building services engineering]]. It is a not-for-profit, member-based association, with over 650 member companies; related services are delivered by a trading company, BSRIA Limited. Any profits made are invested in its research programme, producing best practice guidance.

BSRIA is a full member of the [[Construction Industry Council]].

==Structure==
BSRIA had a turnover of £11.8 million in 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BSRIA|url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/|publisher=BSRIA|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs over 180 people at its UK head office in [[Bracknell]] as well as regionally based engineers in the UK and offices in [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]] and [[North America]].

BSRIA's mission is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSRIA Mission |url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |publisher=BSRIA |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009113932/http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
"to enable the building services and construction industries and their clients to enhance the value of the built environment, by improving the quality of their products and services, the efficiency of their provision and the effectiveness of their operation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History of BSRIA ==
BSRIA was formed in 1955 as the Heating and [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilating]] Research Council, later to become the Heating and Ventilating Research Association. As the industry became increasingly linked with other services so its research association and professional body saw the need to widen their remit. In 1975 the 'building services' scope was adopted, marked by the formation of the Building Services Research and Information Association, commonly shortened to BSRIA, and, in 1976, the formation of the Chartered Institution of Building Services, renamed the [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) in 1985.

As the Association's activities developed to meet the needs of an integrated construction industry and to provide more than just research and information, the full name became less relevant. When new government rules required it to split research and other activities into two companies, BSRIA started formal use of the abbreviation.

Trading activities, including research, are now managed through a trading company, BSRIA Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Building Services Research and Information Association, which is a company limited by guarantee. Thus, members - largely companies active in designing and delivering building services - join the Building Services Research and Information Association, and services are provided by BSRIA Limited.

A '''battler''' is an [[Australian English|Australian]] [[colloquialism]] referring to "ordinary" or [[working class]] individuals who persevere through their commitments despite adversity.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Oxford Dictionary'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/aewords/aewords_ab.php#battler |title=Australian National Dictionary Centre, Australian Words: A-B, Battler |publisher=Anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100805135834/http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/aewords/aewords_ab.php| archivedate= 5 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this adversity comprises the challenges of low pay, family commitments, environmental hardships and lack of personal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sekiya|first=Noriko|title=Aussie `battler’ as a cultural keyword in Australian English|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/72903/Issue1-noriko-sekiya-battler-in-ause.pdf|publisher=Griffith University|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a term of respect and endearment intended to empower and recognize those who feel as though they exist at the bottom of society. The term has seen recent use in mainstream [[politics]] to describe a [[demographic]] section of the Australian people.

==Definition==
The term "Aussie Battler" generally refers to working class Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/australia/strine/a-8.php |title=Joyzine: Australia Decoded |publisher=Artistwd.com |date=2 September 1912 |accessdate=2010-07-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720074015/http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/australia/strine/a-8.php |archivedate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt; specifically, those who feel they must work hard at a low paying job to earn enough money,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodonyamate.com/b-slang.html Goodonyamate: A dictionary of Australian Slang] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121203/http://www.goodonyamate.com/b-slang.html |date=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is actually well respected by Australian society at large as they stoically face perceived financial hardships, in spite of Australian workers being among some of the highest paid and resourceful in the western world. The concept of an "Aussie battler" is an example of self-aggrandizing language, designed to counter feelings of stigma or inadequacy, and to bolster confidence in being a member of the Australian underclass. It refers to an Australian who continues to struggle in the face of hardship. It is a term of respect and endearment, not simply used to assess someone's financial situation; the ordinary working-man earning a living against the odds.
The common variation '''little Aussie battler''' further adds to the notion that the battler is at the bottom of society, working under bigger things above.&lt;ref name="ANDC"/&gt;

In [[Australian English]], the concept of a "battler" is a [[power word]] similar to the concept of the "[[hardworking family]]". It is used by various political personages and entities for their own purposes. Where in one context a person may use the term to refer to people of low socioeconomic status to call for greater welfare, others may use it to refer to a family saving for a private education to call for government payments to private schools.

==Middle-class battlers==
Some individuals are self-defined "battlers" without fitting the above definition because of their own interpretations of "earning enough money." Social scientist and author [[Michael Pusey]] has described this as "Middle Class Battler syndrome"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/spiritofthings/stories/2003/868280.htm |title=ABC Radio National: The Spirit of Things - Hope and Happiness |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Experience-Middle-Australia-Economic-Reform/dp/0521651212 |title=The Experience of Middle Australia: The Dark Side of Economic Reform |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; because these "battlers" earn more than the average wage but see expensive homes and consumer goods as necessities. As a result, they have very little disposable income after servicing debts for these items. Despite the self-inflicted hardship, the myth of the "battler" remains.

==Use in political rhetoric==
Following the election of the [[conservatism|conservative]] coalition government under the leadership of [[John Howard]] in 1996, the phrase was adapted and widely adopted within Australian public discourse.  Howard scored a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections, an achievement some commentators explained by reference to his winning over many traditional [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] voters, whom they now termed "Howard's battlers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/jas/jas.cgi?issue=55 Journal of Australian Studies, Issue 55, 1997, Abstract] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200642/http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/jas/jas.cgi?issue=55 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Exclusive |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22199916-5001021,00.html |title="Rudd Labor battlers dump Howard", The Daily Telegraph, 7 August 2007 |publisher=News.com.au |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The term was allegedly popularised by [[Andrew Robb]], the 1996 [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] campaign director, who used it to describe those blue-collar voters who felt ignored by Labor and who were successfully targeted by the Liberals during the election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,15353312-12854,00.html "Reform dressed up in greasy overalls", ''The Australian'', 21 May 2005]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio interview in 2004, Howard was asked what he thought a 'battler' was and replied that:

{{cquote|... it's not an exclusive definition, the battler is somebody who finds in life that they have to work hard for everything they get... normally you then look at it in terms of somebody who's not earning a huge income but somebody who is trying to better themselves, and I've always been attracted to people who try to better themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/18/1084783513331.html?from=storylhs |title=Brendan Nicholson and Jason Koutsoukis, "Howard's battlers a broad church", ''The Age'', 19 May 2004 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 2004-05-19|accessdate=2010-07-02 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) summit in [[Sydney]] in September 2007, [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] referred to Howard himself as being a 'battler'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/howard-bushs-battler/2007/09/07/1188783458603.html |title=Jane Holroyd, "Howard Bush's 'battler'", ''The Age'', 7 September 2007 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Medieval Studies (CMS)''' is a [[research centre]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]] dedicated to the history, thought, and artistic expression of the cultures that flourished during the [[Middle Ages]].

The centre was founded in 1964, with [[Bertie Wilkinson]] as its first director. Its foundation was announced in [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Graduate Center for Mediaeval Studies: University of Toronto |journal=Speculum |date=October 1963 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1017/S0038713400061698 |jstor=2851698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of the Center is to make available to students various approaches to the Middle Ages in programs of studies not available in existing departments. The purpose of the Center is the training of scholars who know the Middle Ages in depth as well as in breadth. The courses of study will freely cross limits of traditional disciplines and departments, but they will be limited to the Middle Ages. By concentrating on a single period, the student will be able to acquire in some depth the basic linguistic and technical skills necessary for teaching and research in mediaeval studies; these include palaeography, diplomatics, and vernacular languages, in which the Center is strong. He will also be able to read widely in the period. His research will follow the material of his subject in order to gain a better understanding of the cross currents and variations in the cultures, interests, and beliefs of the Middle Ages.}}

The centre had originated in a Medieval Club that met at [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/history/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] (PIMS), which had been founded in 1929 by [[Étienne Gilson]].

The Centre's logo was designed by [[Allan Fleming]], while he was head of graphic design at [[University of Toronto Press]], from 1968–76.&lt;ref name="device"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre Device |url=http://medieval.utoronto.ca/about/device/ |website=Centre for Medieval Studies |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is now located in the [[Lillian Massey Building]], part of [[Victoria University, Toronto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6140">The '''Centro de Arte y Comunicación''' (CAyC) was an arts organization based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], that was instrumental in creating an international arts movement based on the ideas of systems art within [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=CVAA-GrupoCAyC-2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarti|first1=Graciela|title=Grupo CAyC|date=March 2013|publisher=Centro Virtual de Arte Argentino|location=Buenos Aires|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalyva|first1=Eve|title=Image and Text in Conceptual Art: Critical Operations in Context|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-45086-5|pages=80-102|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3.5: "Art and Violence in the Open Air: The Activities of CAYC"|oclc=996426645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In August 1968, CAyC was established as a multidisciplinary workshop by [[Víctor Grippo]], [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernando Benedit]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Clorindo Testa]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], and [[Jorge González (artist)|Jorge González]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaAlbertMuseum-CAyC-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravilious|first1=Ella|title=Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC)|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/factory-presents/centro-de-arte-y-comunicacion-cayc|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Glusberg was the main leader associated with CAyC.&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016 /&gt;

In 1971, the "Grupo de los Trece" was created by Polish theater director [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. There were 13 artists who made up the group: [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernándo Benedit]], [[Gregorio Dujovny]], [[Carlos Ginsburg]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Victor Grippo]], [[Jorge González Mir]], [[Vicente Lucas Marotta]], [[Luis Pazos]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Juan Carlos Romero (artist)|Juan Carlos Romero]], [[Julio Teich]], and [[Horacio Zabala]]. Additional artists who later joined were [[Leopoldo Maler]] and [[Clorindo Testa]]. In 1975, the group were formally named the "Grupo CAyC."&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tortosa|first1=Alina|title=The Glusberg affair in focus|url=http://alinatortosa.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-glusberg-affair-in-focus-jorge_25.html|work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was centered around the concept of "Arte de Sistemas" or Systemic Art.&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003 /&gt;

In 1972, the "Scuola de Altos Estudios del CAyC" aka "Escuela de Altos Estudios" / "Escuela de Altos Estudios del Centro de Arte y Comunicación" was founded.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In the seventies CAyC became an international center for the [[Pop art]]-culture and the famous Museo de Arquitectura.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Well-known teachers at CAyC have included [[Justus Dahinden]] and [[Mario Botta]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

From 1968 until his death in early 2012, [[Jorge Glusberg]] was the Director of CAyC.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13575">'''Centuriation''' (in Latin ''centuriatio'' or, more usually, ''limitatio''&lt;ref&gt;O. A. W. Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],&lt;ref&gt;O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).&lt;ref&gt;A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==
* [[Groma surveying|Groma]]
* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==
[[File:NE-PLSS.JPG|thumb|left|Example of road system in a PLSS area; [[Nebraska]] – US grid system]]
[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps &amp; civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

===Significant examples of centuriation in Italy===

{{Childcare}}
'''Child care''', or otherwise known as '''daycare''', is the care and supervision of a child or multiple children at a time, whose age ranges from six weeks to thirteen years. Child care is the action or skill of looking after children by a day-care center, nannies, babysitter, teachers or other providers. Child care is a broad topic that covers a wide spectrum of professionals, institutions, contexts, activities, social and cultural conventions. Early child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of [[child development]]. Child care providers can be children's first teachers, and therefore play an integral role in systems of [[early childhood education]]. Quality care from a young age can have a substantial impact on the future successes of children. The main focus of childcare is on the development of the child, whether that be mental, social, or psychological.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards: Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|year=2011|isbn=|location=Elk Grove Village|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases children are taken care of by their parents, legal guardians, or siblings. In some cases, it is also seen that children care for other children. This informal care includes verbal direction and other explicit training regarding the child's behavior, and is often as simple as "keeping an eye out" for younger siblings.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"&gt;[Weisner, Thomas S., et al. “My Brother's Keeper: Child and Sibling Caretaking [and Comments and Reply].” Current Anthropology, vol. 18, no. 2, 1977, pp. 169–190., doi:10.1086/201883.]&lt;/ref&gt; Care facilitated by similar-aged children covers a variety of developmental and psychological effects in both caregivers and charge. This is due to their mental development being in a particular case of not being able to progress as it should be at their age.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This care giving role may also be taken on by the child's [[extended family]]. Another form of childcare that is on the rise in contrast to familial caregiving is that of center based child care.In lieu of familial care giving, these responsibilities may be given to paid-caretakers, [[orphanage]]s or [[foster homes]] to provide care, housing, and schooling.

Professional caregivers work within the context of a center-based care (including creches, [[daycare]], [[preschools]] and schools) or a home-based care ([[nannies]] or family daycare). The majority of child care institutions that are available require that child care providers to have extensive training in [[first aid]] and be [[CPR]] certified. In addition, [[background checks]], [[drug testing]] at all centers, and [[Background check|reference verification]] are normally a requirement. Child care can consist of advanced learning environments that include [[early childhood education]] or [[elementary education]]. “The objective of the program of daily activities should be to foster incremental developmental progress in a healthy and safe environment and should be flexible to capture the interests of the children and the individual abilities of the children.” &lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In many cases the appropriate child care provider is a teacher or personal with educational background in child development, which requires a more focused training aside from the common core skills typical of a child caregiver.

As well as these licensed options, parents may also choose to find their own [[caregiver]] or arrange childcare exchanges/swaps with another family.&lt;ref&gt;ChildForum Childcare Information http://www.childforum.com/options-a-differences-between-ece-programmes/73-private-childcare-arrangements-making-your-own-and-what-is-involved.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===In the child's home===
At home, care is typically provided by [[nannies]], [[au pair]]s, or friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AuPair Nanny Differences Au Pair Jobs {{!}} Family Care: Nanny, Sitter, Assistant, Senior Home Care|url = http://www.greataupair.com/nanny-aupair-agency/AuPair-Nanny-Differences.htm|website = www.greataupair.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child is watched inside their own home which could expose them to outside children and illnesses. Depending on the number of children in the home, the children utilizing in-home care could enjoy the greatest amount of interaction with their caregiver, in turn forming a close bond. There are no required licensing or background checks for in-home care, making parental vigilance essential in choosing an appropriate caregiver. Nanny and au pair services provide certified caregivers and the cost of in-home care is the highest of childcare options per child, though a household with many children may find this the most convenient and affordable option. Many nannies study towards childcare qualifications. This means they are trained to create a safe and stimulating environment for your child to enjoy and thrive in. Typically, au pairs or nannies provide more than routine child care, often providing assistance with daily household activities which include running errands, shopping, doing laundry, fixing meals, and cleaning the house.

The most now common way to find a nanny is via the childcare website/care website or a nanny agency. Nanny agencies will thoroughly check an applicant's references and run a criminal background check on the successful candidate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nannycity.com/checking-nanny-references/&lt;/ref&gt; Having a nanny could be cheaper than putting multiple children in a daycare setting full-time. Nannies could provide stability for the child who gets to have a regular role model in their life. Nannies often work overtime and babysit, providing less stress for parents running late without being charged excessive late fees. They also care for sick children whereas nurseries do not. This enables the parents to continue working normally without being interrupted. All nannies have first aid and background checks which are either checked by the agency or the family themselves. They can be subject to visits from their local childcare regulatory bodies. Children with nannies could also be well socialized as nannies could be able to take them out and attend more playdates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daycare vs. Nanny care: The Pros and Cons|url=http://www.pregnancy.org/article/daycare-vs-nannycare-pros-and-cons|publisher=Parents With Nannies, Inc.|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the provider's home===
Family child care providers care for children in the provider's own home. The children could be in a mixed age group with a low adult to child ratio. Care can also potentially be personalized and individual. The hours may be more flexible and the provider may offer evening and weekend care for parents who [[Shift work|work shifts]]. The cost in a family child care could be significantly lower on average than that of a center.

Child care facilities in the US have the option of becoming accredited. This standard is set and regulated by an outside agency. In centers, [[National Association for the Education of Young Children]] institutes it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NAEYC.org National Association for the Education of Young Children].&lt;/ref&gt; For family child care providers, the [[National Association of Family Child Care]] Providers award the credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nafcc.org National Association of Family Child Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensed or unlicensed home daycare is also referred to as family child care, or in home care. It refers to the care provided to a group of children in the home of a caregiver. State laws differ regarding rules for licensed versus unlicensed care. In Canada, most home daycares are unlicensed, and this is completely lawful. Licensing home daycares in Canada can help greatly with oversight, but at the cost of a large portion of the daycare provider's pay. Family child cares are small in size and provide families the same securities as a daycare center, and also has the benefits of flexible hours, lower costs, accessibility, and cultural compatibility. Home-based providers can give more individualized care and therefore better meet the needs of working families. In addition, family care generally has a small ratio of children in care, allowing for more interaction between child and provider than would be had at a commercial care center. Family child care helps foster emotionally secure [[interpersonal relationship]]s for everyone involved. The providers are able to communicate each day with parents on a personal level and share information about the development of the child. Providers care for multi-aged groups of children allowing children to remain with one caregiver for many years which helps children develop a sense of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and security. Multi-aged settings allow children to learn from one another and allow siblings to stay together. Some family child care providers may offer parents more flexibility with hours of operation such as evening, weekend, overnight, and before and after school care. In the United States, some family child care providers work with companies such as Wonderschool, for assistance in licensing, operations, marketing, and administrative support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Magistretti| first = Berenice| title = Wonderschool raises $2 million to launch in-home preschools| url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/19/wonderschool-raises-2-million-to-launch-in-home-preschools/| website = Venture Beat| date = 19 June 2017| access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center Based childcare===
[[File:Childcare Development Center-Crestwood High School cheerleaders 120815-F-PG936-400.jpg|thumb|An American childcare development center]]
In a childcare center, teachers focus on the physical and mental developments of their students. In order to have a greater understanding of the student, teachers in centers must incorporate a relationship with their students that benefits their wants and needs while pushing them toward a higher set of values. This type of teaching with a caring relationship will improve a student's moral and incidental learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~rgriffin/NoddingsCaring.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elementary_school_teacher_dictating_students_-_2003,_Tehran.png|thumb| Elementary school teacher dictating students (2003, [[Tehran]]).]]
Commercial care center also known as daycares are open for set hours, and provide a standardized and regulated system of care for children. Parents may choose from a commercial care center close to their work, and some companies may even offer care at their facilities. A form in which parents pick the child care facility can be based on their mission statement and the objectives they find necessary to be addressed. Center based child care should have their mission written out and include one of the main components which is health promotion.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; These objectives should be shaped to the needs of every child and can change from one to another. The child care provider must see how these objectives are most fit for the child and mend them case by case to their specific needs. In setting up activities for these objectives, both indoor and outdoor activities must be taken into account.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The child must have an experience that partakes in all the different forms. This may then cause discussion between the parents and the caregivers.The parents tend to give their input on what they deem as necessary when the needs of their children may be different.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeon|first=Michael|date=23 February 2013|title=The Morality of Daycare|url=|journal=Philosophia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are able to communicate with the staff of these facilities because workers who speak the same native language or language of preference must be available for these conversations.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The quality of the center based child care can be very influential on the child and on their overall development. Recent study showed that children in low end classrooms saw the activities as forced while the children in high end classrooms had more memorable experiences.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltz|first=Nancy W.|date=2001|title="What do you do in child care?" Children’s perceptions of high and low quality classrooms|url=|journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this being the case between high and low end classrooms, other aspects such as the child's background and living situation can play an important role in their development.&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 2012|title=The Impact of Day Care on Maternal Labor Supply and Child Development in Mexico|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2012/10/15/mexico_daycare_evaluation.pdf|journal=Instituto Nacional De Salud Publica|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active children may thrive in the educational activities provided by a quality commercial care center, but according to the National Center for Early Development and Learning, children from low quality centers may be significantly less advanced in terms of vocabulary and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpg.unc.edu/~NCEDL/pages/project_summary.cfm?study_id=4&lt;/ref&gt; Classes are usually largest in this type of care, ratios of children to adult caregivers will vary according to state licensing requirements. Some positive aspects of commercial care are that children may gain a sense of independence, academic achievement, and [[socialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerbasi|first=Jennifer|title=The Pros and Cons of Daycare|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2009/06/01/pros-cons-daycare/|publisher=FOX News Network|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. Childcare is seen as a reasonable option because it is different than parenting, since it can be seen as more of a routine for the child.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This in turn will only have a negative impact on the child if the parent is not their for the emotional needs of the child.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Children are placed into centers of socialization and learn many similarities and differences from one another from a very young age.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Children are also placed into settings to develop their linguistics and cognitive abilities, which can be measured through observations.&lt;ref name=":153"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 2012|title=The Impact of Day Care on Maternal Labor Supply and Child Development in Mexico|url=http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2012/10/15/mexico_daycare_evaluation.pdf|journal=Instituto Nacional De Salud Publica|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. These early ages of the child's life are crucial or it would otherwise have a negative impact on their future paths.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Pre-school]] is often the term used to refer to child care centers that care primarily for 3 and 4-year old children. Preschool can be based in a center, family child care home or a public school.  Older children, in their turn, in most countries are cared in an educational setting, usually a [[primary school]] environment. The children are supervised by a teacher all day long, who is responsible for their physical, intellectual, emotional and social development. In this regard, most western countries have [[compulsory education]] during which the great majority of children are at school starting from five or six years of age. The school will act ''[[in loco parentis]]'' meaning "in [[list of French words and phrases used by English speakers|lieu]] of parent supervision." In many locales, government is responsible for monitoring the quality of care.

==== Staff ====
For all providers, the largest expense is labor. In a 1999 Canadian survey of formal child care centers, labor accounted for 63% of costs and the industry had an average profit of 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doorwaystocare.ca|title=Doorways To Care|date=2012-01-22|publisher=doorwaystocare.ca|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the labor-intensive nature of the industry, it is not surprising that the same survey showed little [[economies of scale]] between larger and smaller operators.

Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. Laws may mandate staffing ratios (for example 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 months to 18 months, 1:5; 18 months to 24 months, 1:9; et and even higher ratios for older children). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Typically, once the child reaches the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Many employees are at local [[minimum wage]] and are typically paid by the hour rather than [[salary|salaried]]. In the United States, "child care worker" is the fifth most female-dominated occupation (95.5% female in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf|title=Evidence From Census 2000 About Earnings by Detailed Occupation for Men and Women. Census 2000 Special Reports, May 2004.|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, staffing requirements vary from state to state.

===Non-profit daycare===
[[File:The Daycare circa 2009.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A daycare in 2009.]]
"Considerable research has accumulated showing that not-for-profits are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive."&lt;ref name="The Star" /&gt; Not-for-profit organizations are more likely to provide good services to a vulnerable population under conditions that are very hard to monitor or measure.

*[[Non-profit]] day cares have some structural advantages over for-profit operations:
**They may receive preferential treatment in rents especially if they are affiliated with a church that is otherwise unoccupied during the week, or with a school that has surplus space.
**Location within a school may have the advantage of coordinated programs with the school and the advantage of a single location for parents who have older school-age children as well.
**Parents are typically the legal owners of the non-profit day care and will routinely provide consulting services in areas in which they are professionally qualified (for example accounting, legal advice, or human resources) for free. (There are some non-profits not operated by parents, but by a board of directors made up of community representatives who want what is good for the children.)
**Non-profits have an advantage in fund-raising, as most people will not donate to a for-profit childcare organization.
**Non-profits, however, are typically limited in size to a single location, as the parent-owners have no motivation to manage other locations where their children are not present.
**They may suffer from succession issues as children grow and parents leave the management of the day care to other parents.

Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers. In non-profits, the title of the most senior supervisor is typically "executive director", following the convention of most non-profit organizations.

===Family child care homes===
Family child care homes can be operated by a single individual out of their home. In most states, the legal age of 18 is only required. There may be occasions when more than one individual cares for children in a family childcare home.  This can be a stay-at-home parent who seeks supplemental income while caring for their own child. There are also many family childcare providers who have chosen this field as a profession.  Both state and county agency legislation regulate the ratios (number and ages of children) allowed per family child care home.  Some counties have more stringent quality standards that require licensing for family child care homes while other counties require little or no regulations for childcare in individuals' homes. Some family child care homes operate illegally with respect to tax legislation where the care provider does not report fees as income and the parent does not receive a receipt to qualify for childcare tax deductions. However, licensing a family child care home is beneficial for family child care home providers so that they can have access to financial benefits from their state government, or the federal government where they are allowed to accept children from parents who meet the criterion to benefit from the government childcare subsidy funding. Examples of such benefits are: free Professional Development and training courses, Child And Adult Care Food Program (which allows eligible childcare and family childcare home providers to claim a portion of costs relating to nutritious meals served to children), and more;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daycareunitedstates.com/|title=State By State Daycare Search, City By City Daycare Search, Search Daycare Centers and Daycare Homes, Daycare Listings, Child Care Directory, Daycare Locations|date=|publisher=Daycareunitedstates.com|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family childcare may be less expensive than center-based care because of the lower overhead (lower ratios mean less staff are required to maintain regulated ratios. Many family childcare home providers may be certified with the same credentials as center based staff potentially leading to higher level of care.

[[Franchising]] of family child care home facilities attempts to bring economies of scale to home daycare. A central operator handles marketing, administration and perhaps some central purchasing while the actual care occurs in individual homes. The central operator may provide training to the individual care providers. Some providers even offer enrichment programs to take the daycare experience to a more educational and professional level. An example would be Wonderschool, which provides caregivers with a proprietary technology platform, as well as licensing, marketing, and administrative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robynshulman/2017/06/20/how-this-startup-is-disrupting-preschool-and-turning-teachers-into-entrepreneurs/#935c1c73fcba|title=How this startup is disrupting preschool and turning teachers into entrepreneurs|last=Shulman|first=Robyn|date=20 June 2017|website=Forbes|access-date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal care===
Informal childcare is a childcare system that utilizes both family and community members. This includes but is not limited to grandparents, siblings, and both children and adult neighbors. This system is inexpensive and many cultures utilize and embrace informal childcare as beneficial to a child's upbringing and education.

Children that receive informal care do not receive the same educational and preparatory regimens as those in a center- or home-based center often do. Instead, learning occurs informally as a direct result of the caretaker and charge's interactions. Learning and development occur differently for every individual. Different periods of a child's growth are known to affect the care taking styles associated with them, from the care of an infant to that of an older adolescent. Other influences on care taking include the expectations of the three parties involved- the parents, caretakers, and children.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

====Children caring for adults====
Many types of childcare discuss the different ways in which children are cared for by adults or older children. One additional type of child care involves children caring for adults. Children as caretakers are most often seen in developing countries with restricted or hard-to-access medical assistance. Child caretakers are common in families where the parents are affected by [[HIV/AIDS]] and other mental illnesses that might limit their parental functioning.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Evans, Ruth, and Saul Becker. “Children’s and Young People’s Caring Responsibilities within the Family.” Policy Press at the University of Bristol, 2009, pp. 1–38. Global Issues and Policy Responses, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgvzh.5. Accessed 7 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmentally, these child caretakers have shown certain positive associations that affect their future resilience in the face of adversity. Caring for disabled parents raises their sense of responsibility and maturity, increases social and life skills, fosters closer parent-child relationships, and enhances a child’s early sense of purpose. Children caring for sick or disabled parents also experience less anxiety surrounding their parents compared to children who have an additional caregiver for their disabled parent. This is because the children understand more about the illness and feel more in control over the situation.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Cultural Differences==

Childcare varies dramatically across cultures. These discrepancies are attributed to the homestead and household environments. That is, the type of work performed by adult caretakers in a given community strongly influence the type of childcare used. In agricultural/ horticultural societies where work is done to provide sustenance for the community, siblings and similar-aged children are responsible for younger children.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt; While many global communities prefer children aged 7–10 for designated caregiving responsibilities, children no younger than 12 are preferred in the Western world where paid childcare is common.&lt;ref name="Rogoff, Barbara 2003"&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. “4: Child Rearing in Families and Communities.” The Cultural Nature of Human Development, Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors of childcare that vary cross-culturally are the relative ages of both caretaker and child, parental expectations, demands of the child, culturally-varied conceptions of children’s maturity, and factors affecting demographic makeup.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

=== Multi-cultural Care ===

An important aspect that many center based child cares have been trying to implement into their mission statement and everyday routine has been of being aware of the multiple cultures they will be dealing with. This was seen as being important because of the growing numbers of families considering and seeking childcare. Childcare has become an important aspect of society since, “Over thirteen million American children under 5 years of age experience some form of child care before entering formal school.”&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;  Programs must understand similarities and differences between cultures/ ethnic groups. This must be done to understand the overall diversity of the community.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Children should be able to have their cultural practices represented as well as be able to learn about other cultures they have not been exposed to. This is of great importance because it adds to their mental development and their understanding of the world.

===England===
{{Main|Child care in the United Kingdom}}
In England, childcare is inspected and regulated by [http://www.OFSTED.gov.uk OFSTED]  (previously this was administered by Local Authority Social Services). Care for children under five is split into Childcare on Domestic Premises which is Childminding and Daycare. In the UK being a ‘Childminder’ is a protected title and can only be used by registered professionals. Registered Childminders are trained, insured and qualified in Pediatric First Aid. They comply/administer/work with The Early Years Foundation Stage [http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/search/earlyyears/results/nav:46528 EYFS] and have the same responsibilities for education as nurseries and reception classes. They generally work from their own homes and are always self-employed setting their own terms and conditions. The basic numbers of children that childminders can care for is 6 children under 8 years of age; of these children, 3 may be under 5 and of these 1 may be under 1. These numbers include the childminder's own children (although the childminder’s children will not be included in the childminding ‘Certificate’). Some childminders work with either childminding assistants or with co-childminders, which often increases the number of children that can be cared for and individual childminders can request a ‘variation’ which may increase the children that they care for particularly for ‘continuity of care’ or for twins. There is a professional body – the  [http://www.pacey.org.uk Professional Association for Childcare &amp; Early Years] (formerly the National Childminding Association), which “Promotes and supports quality child-minding expertise” and provides information for Childminders and parents. London has greater pressures on childcare provision than other English regions. A recent study by London’s Poverty Profile found the level of childcare provision in London is lower than the England average. In London, there are 4.4 children aged under 8 per childcare place, compared to the England average of 3.9.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/indicators/topics/11-services/childcare-availability-by-borough/&lt;/ref&gt;

Childcare costs in London significantly hinder the living standards of the capital’s residents. A recent study by Loughborough University, funded by Trust for London, found the minimum budget required for a couple with two children to reach a decent standard of living is 22% more in Inner London and 21% more in Outer London than compared with the rest of the UK. The significantly higher costs of childcare influences this heavily, along with housing and transport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/research/minimum-income-standard-for-london/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
In Scotland [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]] is responsible for improving care and education for children from birth to age eighteen. This is implemented by inspections carried out by HMIE itself or by other members of inspection and review teams. Inspection reports include feedback from staff and parents as well as the inspectors, aiming to provide parents and carers information to help them decide whether a particular child care setting is providing good quality child care and meeting government standards.&lt;ref name="VeryTogether: Childproof Your Home!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verytogether.com/family/babies/childproof-your-home.html|title= Childproof Your Home!|publisher= VeryTogether.com | date = 3 April 2009|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Child care can cost up to $15,000 for one year in the United States. The average annual cost of full-time care for an infant in center-based care ranges from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="The Cost of Child Care"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cost of Child Care|url=http://singlemotherguide.com/cost-of-child-care/|publisher=Single Mother Guide|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In monetary- and production-based societies, informal childcare is seen in families who do not have enough funds to finance placing their children in a more expensive child care facility. A study done by Roberta Iversen and Annie Armstrong explains that due to long and irregular working hours of working parents, low- socioeconomic families are more likely to utilize informal childcare.&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, Roberta Rehner, and Annie Laurie Armstrong. 2006. ''Jobs Aren't Enough: Toward a New Economic Mobility for Low-Income Families.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Those low income families are also more apt to work longer hours on an irregular and inflexible schedule, which ultimately makes using a childcare facility, that has regular business hours, unlikely.

In 2001, more than one half of the children in the United States attended childcare facilities. This number has only increased as the number of working parents has increased. The increase in the number of children that are required to have some sort of childcare service has made childcare facilities more necessary than they have ever been.&lt;ref&gt;Yazejian, Noreen, et al. "The Relation Of Preschool Child-Care Quality To Children's Cognitive And Social Developmental Trajectories Through Second Grade." Child Development 72.5 (2001): 1534. Education Research Complete. Web. 16 October 2013.  
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Childcare systems in France put great value into childcare providers having received a certain level of formal education in order to properly care for children. They have two separate branches of early childhood childcare. These two branches are called crèche and école maternelle. Crèche is the program for infants and toddlers and école maternelle is part of the education system. They both require teachers to have a college degree with an occasional specialized degree on top of that.&lt;ref name="Cohn, Jonathan 2013"/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
Many agricultural communities highly value sibling- and peer- caretaking. Accounts from the [[Idakho tribe]] in [[Kenya]] portray infants being left to the care and guidance of other relatively young children in the community with adults and other tribe members merely within shouting distance should a problem arise. The same pattern of caregiving is seen in the [[Kikuyu people]] in Kenya, where mothers in the horticultural society are often away working, which relies on siblings, cousins, and neighbors to care for children as young as 4 months old.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

The children caregivers in many communities are deemed responsible to care for those younger than them and it is expected that they will do so. Adults are viewed as occasional supervisors of the caregiving while the caregivers are responsible for responding to the needs of each child. These young caregivers take pride in their responsibility and learn each child’s individual likes, dislikes, and habits.&lt;ref name="Rogoff, Barbara 2003"/&gt;

==Effects on child development==
===Formal Care===
There are many things to consider when parents enroll a child into a care center or other form of paid childcare, and there is much controversy surrounding the potential benefits and harm caused by this type of care. The parental decisions of leaving a child with someone and who that someone will be are two of the most difficult decisions in the lives of most parents.&lt;ref name="Cohn, Jonathan 2013"&gt;Cohn, Jonathan. "The Hell Of American Day Care. (Cover Story)." New Republic 244.6 (2013): 20. MAS Ultra - School Edition. Web. 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A parent must consider the safety and security of their children when making this decision. The development of a child has many factors, but it is most directly influenced by the type and quality of care that is most regularly provided to the child.

Child development researcher, Lian Tong, analysed the results from a Haley and Stansbury experiment saying, "Parent responsiveness also facilitates cognitive, social, and emotional development and reduces negative emotions in infants."&lt;ref name="Tong, Lian 2012"&gt;Tong, Lian, et al. "Early Development of Empathy in Toddlers: Effects of Daily Parent–Child \Interaction and Home-Rearing Environment." Journal of applied Social Psychology. 42.10 (2012): 2457-2478. Web. 8 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the amount of time that a parent or teacher is willing to spend teaching, listening to, playing with, and exploring with the child the more socially, emotionally, and educationally developed the child will become. Whether that child receives the majority of his or her care at a center or at its house, the biggest factor in deciding what will have the best effect on the child will be those willing to put in the time and effort it takes to properly develop a child's social, physical, and academic skills.

The quality of childcare given by a facility is generally indicated by the center's cost of enrollment.  If the center charges more for the service, it will generally provide better care to the children.  Centers that charge more for their services can provide quality education, more current resources, and nicer facilities. These are all helpful when trying to educate a child academically.  A higher standard for teachers, such as requiring a degree in early childhood education or a degree of the like, has shown to result in improved growth in the development of a child.

Whether at an expensive facility or relatively inexpensive, children who attend daycare facilities tend to develop social skills more quickly than children of the same age group that are reared at home.  They communicate better with children of the same age and often try harder to communicate with those that are younger than them, by using patience and taking different approaches at presenting the data.&lt;ref&gt;Radboud University Nijmegen. "Children who go to daycare may benefit from a wider variety of social situations." ScienceDaily, 30 August 2013. Web. 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly, a study done by Erik Dearing, has proven that negative social behavioral patterns are not directly connected to daycare. By studying a large selection of children from the Norwegian childcare system he concluded that the number of hours a child spends at a daycare and their behavior have no dependent relations.&lt;ref&gt;Dearing, Erik, et al. "New study challenges links between daycare and behavioral issues." ScienceDaily, 17 January 2013. Web. 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   Though in America, children who attend childcare systems have a higher risk of externalizing the symptoms of negative social behavior, exhibiting these traits can directly correlate with their time spent in the center.&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, Gwen. "The Dark Side of Preschool:." The Dark Side of Preschool. N.p., 2013. Web. 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are links between the income, education, and importance of consistency and the well being of the child, to the parents, and the development of their child.  Higher educated parents place more importance on the education of their children than the parents who do not have a college degree or have not graduated from high school.  Likewise, parents who have a higher income level are more willing to part with their money to purchase a private tutor or nanny to assist the parent in the education of their child.  They also tend to stress the importance of being socially inept.&lt;ref name="Tong, Lian 2012"/&gt;  The first few years of a child's life are important to form a basis for good [[education]], [[morality]], [[self-discipline]] and [[social integration]]. Consistency of approach, skills and qualifications of caregivers have been shown in many studies to improve the chances of a child reaching his or her full potential. Child care in much of western society is currently in crisis: there are not enough daycare spots, the cost for most parents is beyond their means, and child care staff are grossly underpaid. Starting wages for Early Childcare Educators start at $11 or $12, causing a high turnover rate, and decreases the likelihood of potentially safe, effective, and loving child care providers from even entering the field. For preschool teachers the average salary is about $28,570.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-troubling-pay-gap-early-childhood-teachers|title=Fact Sheet: Troubling Pay Gap for Early Childhood Teachers {{!}} U.S. Department of Education|website=www.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey done by [[HiMama]], 68% of for-profit child care organizations ranked 'Labor' as their top risk and 65% ranked 'Talent and Recruitment' as their top priority for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.himama.com/blog/benchmark-2017 The HiMama 2017 Child Care Benchmark Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal Care ===
Care given by unpaid providers in an informal setting affect multiple developmental and psychological dimensions in children. Whether the providers are the child’s siblings or a member of the family/community, research dictates this type of care influences factors such as sense achievement, affiliation, conformity, and individual interests.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

More specifically, further research indicates that children being cared for by siblings or similarly-aged children (a trend more commonly seen in agriculturally-based cultural communities) have certain psychological and developmental effects on those being cared for. These effects include but are not limited to: mother-child attachment, emergence of childhood developmental stages, formation of playgroups, development of social responsibility, sex differences, personality differences, cognition, and motivation and performance in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Weisner, Thomas S. 1977, pp. 169"/&gt;

==Health issues==
===Childcare infection===
{{main|Childcare infection}}
Childcare infection is the spread of [[infection]] during [[childcare]], typically because of contact among children in [[daycare]] or [[school]].&lt;ref name=Nesti&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesti|first1=MM|last2=Goldbaum|first2=M|title=Infectious diseases and daycare and preschool education.|journal=Jornal de pediatria|date=July–August 2007|volume=83|issue=4|pages=299–312|pmid=17632670|doi=10.2223/jped.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens when groups of children meet in a childcare environment, and there is an individual with an infectious disease who may then spread it to the entire group. Commonly spread diseases include [[influenza-like illness]] and enteric illnesses, such as diarrhea among babies using diapers. Illnesses and diseases may also include ringworm, head lice, and hand, feet, mouth disease. It is uncertain how these diseases spread, but [[hand washing]] reduces some risk of transmission and increasing hygiene in other ways also reduces risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren-Gash|first1=C|last2=Fragaszy|first2=E|last3=Hayward|first3=AC|title=Hand hygiene to reduce community transmission of influenza and acute respiratory tract infection: a systematic review.|journal=[[Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses]]|date=September 2013|volume=7|issue=5|pages=738–49|pmid=23043518|doi=10.1111/irv.12015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=MB|last2=Greig|first2=JD|title=A review of enteric outbreaks in child care centers: effective infection control recommendations.|journal=Journal of environmental health|date=October 2008|volume=71|issue=3|pages=24–32, 46|pmid=18990930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to social pressure, parents of sick children in childcare may be willing to give [[unnecessary medical care]] to their children when advised to do so by childcare workers and even if it is against the advice of health care providers.&lt;ref name="Rooshenas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rooshenas|first1=L|last2=Wood|first2=F|last3=Brookes-Howell|first3=L|last4=Evans|first4=MR|last5=Butler|first5=CC|title=The influence of children's day care on antibiotic seeking: a mixed methods study.|journal=The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|date=May 2014|volume=64|issue=622|pages=e302-12|pmid=24771845|doi=10.3399/bjgp14x679741|pmc=4001146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, children in childcare are more likely to take antibiotics than children outside of childcare.&lt;ref name="Rooshenas"/&gt;

==Value of unpaid childcare==
Parents spend a significant amount of time raising their children. These parents nurture and develop their children into being functional members of society. This hard work is not motivated by monetary gain. For centuries it has been assumed that women will stay home and take care of the children while their husbands go out and work. In most cases, the husbands get all the credit for providing for the family. However, the wife who is the homemaker, deserves just as much credit for her care work. Caregivers do not receive monetary compensation and they must pay a ‘care-penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy. The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values. New York: New, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A care-penalty is the price one pays for doing care work for a family member. Care giving demands a lot out of an individual, and as a result there is a high opportunity cost. The opportunity cost can relate to both time and money. Instead of taking care of a family member, a [[caregiver]] could spend time working or performing more leisure activities. Care penalties are not strictly related to childcare- they can also refer to taking care of a sick family member, babysitting a younger sibling, or taking an elderly family member on errands such as grocery shopping or doctor's appointments.

===Monetary Value===
Studies have been done to get an annual salary estimate for a female caregiver. One survey suggested that the value of a mother's work, if she were paid the average wage for each task she performs in running the household and caring for her children, is $117,867 per year.&lt;ref&gt;"Mom Salary Wizard?2010. Mother's Day Paycheck for Mom's Job." Web. &lt;http://swz.salary.com/momsalarywizard/htmls/mswl_momcenter.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the high salary is because mothers typically perform about 10 different job functions throughout the week.  Some of these job functions are poorly paid, including cleaning, driving, caring for children, and washing laundry, but others, especially financial and managerial tasks that the survey equated with being the [[Chief Executive Officer]] of a company, are highly paid.  Neither a nanny nor a housekeeper makes nearly as much money, and almost all of these tasks except direct child care also have to be done by non-parents. The value of unpaid childcare is also an important figure in various legal entities. Expert witnesses (most often economists) are occasionally brought into court cases to give estimates on the value of unpaid labor. By giving estimation, the plaintiff or defendant can be fairly compensated for their labor.

===Societal Value===
It is important to assess the value of caregivers because they are what truly make society function,&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy. "Valuing Unpaid Work Matters, Especially for the Poor - NYTimes.com." The Economy and the Economics of Everyday Life - Economix Blog - NYTimes.com. Web. &lt;https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/valuing-unpaid-work-matters-especially-for-the-poor/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and often their work is under-appreciated. They prepare the next generation for school, work, and decision-making. The way in which a child is nurtured at a young age and through adolescence has both psychological and developmental effects that effect their future. Not only does the child depend on caregiving, but schools and employers depend on the childcare. The government also benefits because these children turn into productive members of society. Eventually, they will be the ones running the country.

Developmental benefits are also seen for older siblings or relatives tasked to care for younger children.  For example, children with siblings are more likely to prohibit prosocial behaviors (such as the ability to take another's perspective or sharing with others) than children without siblings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Readings on the Development of Children", Mary Gauvain and Michael Cole&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, sibling caretakers have to opportunity to develop deeper communication skills as they teach younger siblings to participate in everyday tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==History==

According to [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], the first humans were few; then the population "exploded .... Population expansion on such a scale is inconsistent with female tolerance of infanticide, harassment, or the heavy costs to mothers of male philandering and double standards. If unusually large numbers of unusually large-brained offspring were being successfully raised to maturity, the quality of childcare must have been exceptional. We know what the optimal solution would have been. There can be no doubt that mothers would have done best by ... taking advantage of every available childcare resource."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Chris, ''Early Human Kinship was Matrilineal'', in Allen, Nicholas J., Hillary Callan, Robin Dunbar, &amp; Wendy James, eds., ''Early Human Kinship: From Sex to Social Reproduction'' (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Publishing, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-1-4051-7901-0}})), pp. 81-82 (author prof. anthropology, Univ. of East London).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, around 394 &lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;, argued that a system of child care would free women to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;Schönpflug, Karin, ''Feminism, Economics and Utopia: Time Travelling Through Paradigms'' (Oxon/London: Routledge, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-415-41784-6}})), pp. 159–160 (author economist, [[Austria]]n Ministry of Finance, &amp; lecturer, [[University of Vienna|Univ. of Vienna]]), citing Rohrlich, R. &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, ''Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers'' (N.Y.: Schocken Books, 1984), and Plato, [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] (''ca.'' 394 B.C.).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early English authors to devote a book to child care in the modern sense was [[Elizabeth Dawbarn]] (''The Rights of Infants, or... Nursing of Infants'', 1805).&lt;ref&gt;''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Day care''', '''daycare''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/day-care day care or daycare] in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=day+care daycare or day care] in the American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; '''child day care''', or '''childcare''' is the care of a child during the day by a person other than the child's [[legal guardian]]s, typically performed by someone outside the child's immediate [[family]]. Day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods, such as the parents' time at [[Employment|work]].

''Day care'' can also refer to daytime care for disabled or elderly people in both UK and US English,&lt;ref name=oedd&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/day_care|title=day care - Definition of day care in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/day-care|title=Definition of DAY-CARE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; so ''child day care'' is often preferable at first mention.

The service is known as ''day care''&lt;ref name=oedd/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; or ''childcare''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/childcare|title=childcare - Definition of childcare in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rh/&gt;&lt;ref name=mwcc/&gt; in the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia and as ''crèche'' in Ireland and New Zealand. According to Oxford Living Dictionaries, ''child care'' in two words can in addition have the broader meaning of the care of a child by anyone, including the parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/child_care|title=child care - Definition of child care in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; but US dictionaries do not record that spelling or meaning.&lt;ref name=rh&gt;https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/child-care Random House Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=child+care|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: child care|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|website=www.ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mwcc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/child+care|title=Definition of CHILD CARE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English-speaking and other conservative countries, the vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nannies or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends, but most children are in daycare centers for most of the day in Nordic Countries, for example. Child care in the child's own [[household|home]] is traditionally provided by a [[nanny]] or [[au pair]], or by extended family members including grandparents, aunts and uncles. Child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a [[nanny]] or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes. It can also take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline and even [[preschool education]] falling into the fold of services.

The day care [[industry]] is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions. Some [[childminder]]s care for children from several families at the same time, either in their own home (commonly known as "family day care" in Australia) or in a specialized child care facility. Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment. For-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies. Research shows that not-for-profits are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive."&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/310203 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Child care must serve kids not corporate shareholders | first1=Martha | last1=Friendly | first2=Margaret | last2=McCain | date=March 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers. For all providers, the largest expense is labor. Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification. Legislation may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.).

Independent studies suggest that good daycare is not harmful.&lt;ref name="Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N 2000 727–47"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N |title=Maternal versus nonmaternal care and seven domains of children's development |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=727–47 |year=2000 |pmid=10989621 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.727}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two and are ready to interact with other children. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care.

=== Learning Stories ===
Learning Stories &lt;ref&gt;Carr, M. (2012) Learning stories : constructing learner identities in early education. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; are documents that are used by caregivers and educators in childcare settings. They use a storytelling format instead of a traditional ‘observation’ report to document the different ways that young children learn, and capture the moment in greater detail and provide parents with a greater insight into the events that occur in their child’s time in childcare.

'''What they include'''

* Story of the child’s progress
* Pictures of the experiences (Optional)
* The child’s strengths, interests and needs
* Space for parent feedback &lt;ref&gt;Kearns, K, 2010. Birth to Big School. 2nd ed. Frenchs Forest, NSW: Pearson Australia.",&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning stories originate from New Zealand as they use a learning model in their curriculum called "Te Whaariki". It highlights children's learning outcomes as 'disposition' which are “situated learning strategies plus motivation-participation repertoires from which a learner recognize, selects, edits, responds
to, resists, searches for and constructs learning opportunities” &lt;ref&gt;Blaiklock, K (2008) A critique of the use of learning stories to assess the learning dispositions of young children, NZ Research in ECE Journal, Vol. 11, pg 77-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Ryan. 2006.

The first crèche was opened by [[Firmin Marbeau]] on 14 November 1844 in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = U.K. Board of Education | chapter = The Development of Infant Schools and of Separate Nursery Schools from 1905 to the Present Time | title = Early Years Education: Major Themes in Education | editor = Rod Parker-Rees and Jenny Willan | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-32669-9 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Société des Crèches was recognized by the French government in 1869. Originating in Europe in the late 18th and early 19th century, day cares were established in the United States by private charities in the 1850s, such as the Charity Organization Society founded by [[Ansley Wilcox]].  The Fitch Creche in [[Buffalo, New York]] was known as the first day center for working mothers in the United States. Another at that time was the New York Day Nursery in 1854.

More contemporary proposals for government advancement of day care in the United States have experienced a checkered path, for example, in 1971, the [[Comprehensive Child Development Act]] was passed by Congress, but was vetoed by Richard Nixon. It "would have created nationally funded child care centers providing early childhood services and after-school care, as well as nutrition, counseling, and even medical and dental care. The centers would charge parents on a sliding scale."&lt;ref&gt;Onion, Rebecca, ''[http://www.slate.com/blogs/better_life_lab/2017/06/14/anti_communism_and_its_role_in_america_s_lack_of_affordable_daycare.html Your Child Care Conundrum Is an Anti-Communist Plot]'', [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], June 14, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Various proposals have been considered, but to date, none leading to legislation that would establish a national policy supporting day care in the United States.

==Business==
The day care [[industry]] is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions.

The vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nanny or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends. For example, in [[Canada]], among two parent families with at least one working parent, 62% of parents handle the childcare themselves, 32% have other in-home care (nannies, relatives, neighbours or friends) and only 6.5% use a formal day care center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/Private%20Sector%20Can%20Meet%20Child%20Care%20Demands-Mar04fftaylor.pdf |title=The Fraser Institute |publisher=Fraserinstitute.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208184721/http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/Private%20Sector%20Can%20Meet%20Child%20Care%20Demands-Mar04fftaylor.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies. For instance, in North America, [[KinderCare Learning Centers]], one of the largest of such companies, has approximately 1,600 centers located in 39 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookroomreviews.com/tag/kindercare-learning-centers/ |title=KinderCare Learning Centers |publisher=Book Room Reviews |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bright Horizons Family Solutions]] another of the largest has over 600 daycare centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2003/commentary030918sm.htm |title=Bright Horizons for Bright Horizons |publisher=Fool.com |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]'s childcare subsidy has allowed the creation of a large private-sector industry in that country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mychild.gov.au/documents/docs/StateofChildCareinAustralia-web.pdf|title=Documents - MyChild.gov.au|website=www.mychild.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor favoring large corporate daycares is the existence of childcare facilities in the workplace. Large corporations will not handle this employee benefit directly themselves and will seek out large corporate providers to manage their corporate daycares. Most smaller, for-profit daycares operate out of a single location.

In general, the geographic limitations and the diversity in type of daycare providers make child daycare a highly fragmented industry. The largest providers own only a very small share of the market. This leads to frustration for parents who are attempting to find quality child daycare, with 87% of them describing the traditional search for child daycare as "difficult and frustrating".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Standards and requirements==
[[File:US Navy 050114-N-3659B-050 he Morale Welfare and Recreation Child Development Center on board Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tenn., provides daycare services.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A child playing with a toy in a daycare.]]
Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification.  Parents may also turn to independent rating services, or rely on recommendations and referrals.  Some places develop voluntary quality networks, for example in Australia most childcare services are part of a national Quality Assurance system. Some places require caregivers to take classes in [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and [[first aid]]. Most countries have laws relating to childcare, which seek to keep children safe and prevent and punish [[child abuse]].  Such laws may add cost and complexity to childcare provision and may provide tools to help ensure quality childcare.

Additionally, legislation typically defines what constitutes daycare (e.g., so as to not regulate individual babysitters). It may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.). The minimum window space may be such that it precludes day cares from being in a basement. It may specify the minimum floor space per child (for example 2.8 square metres) and the maximum number of children per room (for example 24). It may mandate minimum outdoor time (for example 2 hours for programs 6 hours or longer). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Some legislation also establishes rating systems, the number and condition of various toys, and documents to be maintained.&lt;ref name="ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us/parents/pr_sn2_ps.asp |title=Star Rated License: Program Standards |publisher=Ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723135940/http://ncchildcare.dhhs.state.nc.us/parents/pr_sn2_ps.asp |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, once children reach the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

Legislation may mandate staffing ratios (for example, 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 months to 18 months, 1:5; 18 months to 24 months, 1:9; etc.). The caregiver-to-child ratio is one factor indicative of quality of care.  Ratios vary greatly by location and by daycare center. Potential consequences of a caregiver:child ratio which is too high could be very serious {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. However, many states allow a higher numbers of toddlers to caregivers and some centers do not comply consistently. For example, within the US: Pennsylvania, ages 1–3, 1 teacher to 5 children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/055/chapter3270/s3270.51.html |title=055 Pa. Code § 3270.51.

Many organizations in the developed world campaign for free or subsidized childcare for all. Others campaign for tax breaks or allowances to provide parents a non-finance driven choice. Many of the free or subsidized childcare programs in the United States are also Child Development programs, or afterschool programs which hire certified teachers to teach the children while they are in their care. There are often local industry associations that lobby governments on childcare policy, promote the industry to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childcaretoday.ca/aboutadcos7.php |title=About ADCO - ADCO :: The Association of Day Care Operators of Ontario :: Childcare Today |publisher=Childcaretoday.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or help parents choose the right daycare provider.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daycarematch.com/associations.asp{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, childcare in regulated commercial or family childcare home setting is administered or led by teachers who may have a [[Child Development Associate]] or higher credentials. These higher credentials include Associate, Bachelor, and even master's degrees in the field of Early Childhood Education (ECE).  Although childcare professionals may obtain a degree, many states require that they attend workshops yearly to upgrade their knowledge and skill levels. Many day cares require a teacher to obtain a certain amount of training. For example, Texas requires a minimum of 25 hours a year, and the first year as a teacher, you are required to have 50 hours.

==Worldwide ==

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has a large child care industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echildcare.com.au/about/ |title=About This Site &amp;#124; The Australian Childcare Index |publisher=Echildcare.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in many locations (especially in inner-city suburbs of large cities and in rural areas) the availability is limited and the waiting periods can be up to several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/NATIONAL/Govt-misleading-parents-on-childcare/2007/01/04/1167777200891.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Govt 'misleading parents on childcare' | date=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]'s Child Care Subsidy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/child-care-subsidy |title=Centrelink website |publisher=Centrelink.gov.au |date=2018-08-15 |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; scheme provides generous assistance with child care costs, but this still leaves many families with a large out of pocket expense. The median weekly cost of centre-based long day care in 2013 was approximately A$364&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/research/ongoing/report-on-government-services/2014/child-care,-education-and-training/download-the-volume/rogs-2014-volumeb-child-care-education-and-training.pdf |title=Report on Government Services 2014 Volume B: Child care, education and training |publisher=Australian Productivity Commission |date= |accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which puts it out of the reach of lower income earners.&lt;ref&gt;https://ris.govspace.gov.au/files/2015/07/20150703-Published-Consultation-RIS-for-the-Child-Care-Assistance-Package.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulation is governed by the ACECQA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acecqa.gov.au/welcome |title=Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority |publisher=acecqa.gov.au |date=2013-12-07 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a federal government body, which acts as a central body for the state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acecqa.gov.au/regulatory-authorities1/national-registers |title=State and territory registers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratios are:

* 1:4 for infants, 
* 1:5 for 2 – 3 years old (since 31/12/2015, when it was 1:8) and 
* 1:11 for preschoolers (since 31/12/2015 when it was 1:10)

All childcare workers must have, or be undertaking, the minimum "Certificate III in Children's Services" in order to work in a centre ([[Recognition of Prior Learning]] is available to help qualify staff with many years experience, but no qualifications). (Common more advanced qualifications are "Diploma of Children's Services" and an Early Childhood Education degree).

Rules differ between states regarding family day care in Australia. To start a Family Day Care business in Victoria, an educator should be either having "Certificate III in Children's Services" or be actively working towards the same. Additionally, Current Police check, Current First Aid training, Insurance (specifically for family day care) is necessary for starting a family day care. The house should be safe for children. A group of 15 educators works under one Supervisor who must have a "Diploma in Children's Services".

===Canada===
[[Canada]] offers both private and subsidized daycare centers. Some shortages of subsidized openings can lengthen the time needed to find a suitable childcare provider. To counter this, government or private enterprise sometimes enable parents to look for available spaces online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gouv.qc.ca/services-en-ligne/localisateur/index_en.asp Childcare establishment locator &gt; MFA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/children/childcare.htm |title=City of Toronto: Child Care Finder |publisher=Toronto.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]] day-cares accept children ranging from 6 months old to 3 years old. 91.2% of 1-2 year old children are enrolled in different types of day-care institutions. Most of these are managed by a municipality and mostly government funded. The different types of institutions ranges from separate day-care institutions (''Vuggestue''), kindergartens with a day-care department (''Integrerede institutioner'') and in-home day-care (''Dagpleje'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flere børn bliver passet ude|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2014/NR146.pdf|website=Danmarks Statistik|publisher=Danmarks statistik|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-cares are play-based focusing on the children’s perspective and involvement in the day-to-day life. The day-cares are staffed by trained social educators or [[Pedagogy#Pedagogues|pedagogues]] (''pædagog'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vejledning om dagtilbud m.v.|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=168574|website=Retsinformation.dk|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:East Berlin childminders, with children and strollers, seated on a wall, 1984.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A group of [[East Berlin]] children, with their [[Nanny|caretakers]], 1984.]]
In [[Germany]], preschool education is the domain of the ''Kindertagesstätte'' (literally "children's day site", often shortened to ''Kita'' or ''KITA''), which is usually divided into the ''Kinderkrippe'' (crèche) for toddlers (age up to 3 years), and the ''Kindergarten'' for children who are older than three years and before school.  Children in their last Kindergarten year may be grouped into a ''Vorschule'' ("preschool") and given special pedagogic attention;  special preschool institutions comparable to the US-American kindergarten are the exception.

Kitas are typically run by public (i. e. communal) and "free" carriers (such as the churches, other religious organizations, social organizations with a background in the trade unions and profit-orientated corporations), and subsidized by the states (''Länder'').  In this case, the care is open to the general public—e. g. a Protestant or Muslim child may claim a place in a Kita run by the catholic church.

Preschool education, unlike school and university, is not in the exclusive domain of the states.  The federal government regulates daycare through the ''Kinder- und Jugendhilfegesetz (KJHG)'', which stipulates a legal claim to daycare:
* for children over the age of three and before school (i. e. Kindergarten;  this law became effective in 1996);
* for children under the age of three and before Kindergarten (i. e. Kinderkrippe;  this law becomes effective August 1, 2013).

Alternative daycare can be provided through ''Tagespflegepersonen'' (usually ''Tagesmütter'', "day mothers"), i. e. stay-at-home parents which provide commercial day care to other children.  This form of daycare is also federally regulated through the KJHG.

Preschool education (''Frühpädagogik'') is increasingly seen as an integral part of education as a whole;  several states such as [[Bavaria]] have released detailed educational plans for daycare carriers who claim state subsidies.  "Early pedagogics" has increasingly moved into the academic domain, with an increasing number of staff being trained at universities of applied science (''[[Fachhochschule]]n'') and regular universities.  Non-academic personnel in daycare facilities have usually attended specialized schools for several years.  In the state of Bavaria for example, daycare assistants (''Kinderpfleger'') will have attended school for two years, daycare teachers (''Erzieher'') for three years with an additional two-year internship.

===Japan===
In Japan, the child care industry is worth trillions of [[yen]], and is expanding due to rising work force participation by mothers. In 2004 nearly 2 million children were in some form of day care. ([https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/reports/market/pdf/2005_69_p.pdf Jetro])

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa created a Social Program named "Programa de Estancias Infantiles" that included more than 8,000 daycare spaces for children between 1 and 3.11 years old. This program subsidizes mothers that work and study and also single fathers in a vulnerable situation. It has a great success having more than 125,000 children over the country. This is regulated by the Social Development Minister (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social).[http://www.sedesol.gob.mx]

Childcare has been on the rise in Mexico due to the increasing interest it has within the people and the effect it has on the government. This is due to the rise of urban areas in developing countries and the need to keep up with the economic development.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Rebecca|last2=Levine|first2=Ruth|date=1992|title=The Effect of Household Structure on Women's Economic Activity and Fertility|url=|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has always been many child care services available but due to the high costs, they were mainly unavailable for the low income families.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Gabriela|date=April 2014|title=The Effects of Child Care Provision in Mexico|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-discursos/publicaciones/documentos-de-investigacion/banxico/%7B0AFBA0F8-0973-907E-9ED4-5AC6E445E064%7D.pdf|journal=Banco de México Documentos de Investigación|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare became a hot topic of discussion when more women were joining the workforce and the debate of how this would affect how the children would be raised.&lt;ref name=":124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Staab|first=Silke|last2=Gerhard|first2=Roberto|date=May 2010|title=Childcare Service Expansion in Chile and Mexico: For Women or Children or Both?|url=|journal=Gender and Development Programme Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another topic of debate is how would the women pay for these expensive services while working minimum wage jobs or having limited times they could work, so the idea of subsidizes arose.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; In specific to the child, the topic of “street children”, how and where children should grow up, was debated, and if they should be allowed to be considered part of the street instead of a particular home.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gigengack|first=Roy|date=1994|title=Social Practices of Juvenile Survival and Mortality: Child Care Arrangements in Mexico City|url=|journal=Community Development Journal,|volume= 29. Num. 4|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was of great debate because it not only affects the child but also the community the child is in, since they usually seek out public spaces for shelter, food and play.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Childcare is generally broken into three general categories such as governmental institutions, religious organizations, and independent agencies (such as NGOS).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; All of these take on the same objectives which are “containment, paternalist cure approach and street education.”&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The creation of childcare programs in Mexico is quite different from others because it focuses on the “defeminization of labor and the defamilization of care.”&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; Female participation is a goal that the government has so it set in place many policies and modes to achieve this.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; The creation of a successful program of child care has been sought out and many different aspects have been changed over the years but it can be seen that there is an increase in early childhood education and care services (ECEC).&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; ECEC services can be broken down into three different time periods and models which were implemented. The first would be in the 1970s when the Institute for Social Security focuses on covering children for mothers who were covered by Social Security services.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This caused a huge gap in the children that could be covered due to the fairly large amount of women working in the informal sector and being denied these services. The second stage would be in the early 200s when the Ministry of Public education made preschool mandatory for all children from ages 3 to 5.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This was useful in theory because all of the children in this age range would be cared for, but in reality caused a strain in the amount of time that the parents had to go and work or dedicate their time elsewhere. The last stage would be in 2007 when the Ministry of Social Development created a childcare program in which was focuses on helping out children and mothers who were not covered by the social security services.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This was successful since it targeted low income families specifically. For families to be eligible for this service the mothers had to be working or searching for a job, the income was taken into consideration in comparison to that of minimum wage, and that they did not have any other access to services.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderon|first=Gabriela|date=April 2014|title=The Effects of Child Care Provision in Mexico|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-discursos/publicaciones/documentos-de-investigacion/banxico/%7B0AFBA0F8-0973-907E-9ED4-5AC6E445E064%7D.pdf|journal=Banco de México Documentos de Investigación|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's participation in the workforce and be directly tied to the availability of childcare services and how it would affect their household.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt;

The program that was created in 2007 became known as the Federal Daycare Programme for Working Mothers.&lt;ref name=":124"/&gt; This program allowed for subsidized home and community based childcare. The one running the care centers would only have to have a training component, which consisted of a psychological test and training courses to understand the principles of childcare, before being able to open their business in which they would be given money to furnish the facility as necessary for a safe caring center to be created.&lt;ref name=":124" /&gt; Another way this program was set into place was by subsidizing the care of non-profits, private for profits, or religious institutions who were based in the area of need.&lt;ref name=":124" /&gt;

=== Norway ===
Many children in [[Norway]] start daycare between 10 months and 3 years old. Funded parental leave for working parents is either 44 weeks with full pay, or 54 weeks with 80% pay (both up to a certain level only). The government guarantees daycare for all children that are at least 1 year old by 1 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd/Selected-topics/kindergarden.html?id=1029 |title=Kindergarten |publisher=regjeringen.no |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage is still not 100%, but most regions are getting close (2011). There's a maximum price to enable all families to afford it.

===Spain===
[[Spain]] provides paid [[maternity leave]] of 16 weeks with 30-50% of mothers returning to work (most full-time) after this{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, thus babies 4 months of age tend to be placed in daycare centers. Adult-infant ratios are about 1:7-8 first year and 1:16-18 second year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Public preschool education is provided for most children aged 3–5 years in "Infantil" schools which also provide [[primary school]] education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Child care in the United Kingdom}}
The UK has a wide range of childcare options, including [[childminder]]s, day nurseries, [[Pre-school playgroup|playgroups]] and pre-school education at school.  It is regulated by [[Office for Standards in Education|OFSTED]] ([[CSSIW]] in Wales), which operates the application and inspection process for the sector.

Childcare is primarily funded by parents, however the Single Funding Formula (pre-school funding) can be used at some day nurseries, playgroups and schools for a maximum of 5 sessions per week, after a child reaches 3 years.  The government introduced a childcare allowance (vouchers) by which employers could make payments for childcare, prior to tax, on employees' wages.

Median rates (2011) are approximately £4.50 per hour for childminders, £7:5-£10 net per hour for nannies, £60-100 per week for au pairs and £35-£50 per day for day nurseries.

===United States===
State legislation may regulate the number and ages of children allowed before the home is considered an official daycare program and subject to more stringent safety regulations. Often the nationally recognized [[Child Development Associate]] credential is the minimum standard for the individual leading this home care program.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Each state has different regulations for teacher requirements. In some states, teachers must have an associate degree in child development. States with quality standards built into their licensing programs may have higher requirements for support staff such as teacher assistants. And in Head Start programs, by 2012, all lead teachers must have a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education.  States vary in the standards set for daycare providers, such as teacher to child ratios.

Family childcare can also be nationally accredited by the National Association of Family Childcare if the provider chooses to go through the process. National accreditation is only awarded to those programs who demonstrate the quality standards set forth by the NAFCC.

According to the 1995 [[U.S. Census Bureau]] [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP), over thirty-six percent of families of preschoolers with working mothers primarily relied on childcare in the home of a relative, family daycare provider or other non-relative. Almost twenty-six percent of families used organized childcare facilities as their primary arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/archive/child_care.shtml|title= Child care|publisher= Almanac of Policy Issues:  |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child care can cost up to $15,000 for one year in the United States. The average annual cost of full-time care for an infant
in center-based care ranges from $4,863 in Mississippi to $16,430 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="The Cost of Child Care"/&gt;

==Child development==
{{Main|Child development}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Handicapped Event.jpg|thumb|left|A child care assistant holding the little girl and her [[Easter]] eggs.]] --&gt;
Independent studies suggest that good daycare for non-infants is not harmful.&lt;ref name="Erel O, Oberman Y, Yirmiya N 2000 727–47"/&gt;  In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two and are ready to interact with other children. Bad daycare puts the child at physical, emotional and attachment risk. Higher quality care was associated with better outcomes. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care. They were also somewhat more cooperative than those who experienced lower quality care during the first 3 years of life.

The National Institute of Health released a study in March, 2007 after following a group of children through early childhood to the 6th grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/mar2007/nichd-26.htm |title=Early Child Care Linked to Increases in Vocabulary, Some Problem Behaviors in Fifth and Sixth Grades, March 26, 2007 - National Institutes of Health (NIH) |publisher=Nih.gov |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the children who received a higher quality of childcare scored higher on 5th grade vocabulary tests than the children who had attended childcare of a lower quality.  The study also reported that teachers found children from childcare to be "disobedient", fight more frequently, and more argumentative.  The study reported the increases in both aggression and vocabulary were small. "The researchers emphasized that the children’s behavior was within the normal range and were not considered clinically disordered."

As a matter of social policy, consistent, good daycare, may ensure adequate [[early childhood education]] for children of less skilled parents. From a parental perspective, good daycare can complement good parenting.

A 2001 report showed that children in high-quality care scored higher on tests of language, memory and other skills than did children of stay-at-home mothers or children in lower-quality day care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/51682/ How the Media Perpetuate Women's Fears of Being a Bad Mother] in [[AlterNet]] May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study appearing in ''Child Development'' in July/August 2003 found that the amount of time spent in daycare before four-and-a-half tended to correspond with the child's tendency to be less likely to get along with others, to be disobedient, and to be aggressive, although still within the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2003/nichd-16.htm |title=NIH News--Child Care Linked To Assertive, Noncompliant, and Aggressive Behaviors--07/16/2003 |work=nih.gov |accessdate=27 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181352/http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2003/nichd-16.htm |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-8624.00582 |title=Does Amount of Time Spent in Child Care Predict Socioemotional Adjustment During the Transition to Kindergarten? |journal=Child Development |volume=74 |issue=4 |publisher=Wiley |pages=976–1005 |date=July 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Codex Marianus''''' is an [[Old Church Slavonic]] fourfold [[Gospel Book]] written in [[Glagolitic script]], dated to the beginning of the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaganay|first=Léon|title=An introduction to New Testament textual criticism|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-42493-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3XFkk27-YYC&amp;pg=PA44 |author2=Christian-Bernard Amphoux |author3=Jenny Heimerdinger|accessdate=22 November 2011|page=44|quote=Codex Marianus, from the beginning of the eleventh century, was also copied in Macedonia and is kept in Moscow (two leaves are in Vienna)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is (along with [[Codex Zographensis]]), one of the oldest manuscript witnesses to the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, one of the two fourfold gospels being part of the [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|Old Church Slavonic canon]].

==History==
Most of the Codex (172 folios, 171 according to some sources) was discovered by {{ill|Viktor Grigorovič|uk|Григорович Віктор Іванович}} at [[Mount Athos]] during a journey to the [[Balkans]] in 1844-45, in a hermitage belonging to the [[Monastery of the Holy Mother of God]] (the Blessed [[Theotokos]]), and thus the manuscript was named ''Codex Marianus'' in Latin. Grigorovič took the found folios to Kazan', and after his death in 1876 the Codex was transferred to [[Russian State Library]] in [[Moscow]] where it carries the catalog number грнг 6 (M.1689). Croatian diplomat and amateur scholar [[Antun Mihanović]] acquired 2 folios (containing Matthew 5.23 - 6.16) some time before Grigorovič made his discovery, and sent it to renowned Slovene Slavist [[Franc Miklošič]], who had them published in 1850. After Miklošič's death, the two-folio fragment was deposited in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]] under the catalog number Cod. Slav. 146.

The Codex was first published by Croatian Slavist [[Vatroslav Jagić]] in 1883 in [[Berlin]] as ''Quattuor Evangeliorum versionis palaeoslovenicae Codex Marianus Glagoliticus'', transcribed in [[Cyrillic script]] and with extensive philological commentary in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Reprint was published in Graz in 1960.

==Linguistic analysis and origin==
Text of Codex especially abounds with the usage of [[Old Church Slavonic grammar#Asigmatic aorist|asigmatic aorist]], and very frequent is the assimilation of vowels in compound adjectival declension and present forms (''-aago'', ''-uumu'' instead of ''-aego'', ''-uemu''; ''-aatъ'' instead of ''-aetъ'' etc.).

Analysing the language of the Codex, Vatroslav Jagić concluded that one of the scribes of the Codex came from the Eastern-rite [[Štokavian]] area (see [[Old Church Slavonic#Serbian recension|Serbian recension]]), on the basis of substitutions ''u'' - ''ǫ'', ''i'' - ''y'', ''u'' - ''vъ'', ''e'' - ''ę'' etc. The conclusion about Serbo-Croatian origin of the Codex has been disputed by Russian [[Slavic studies|slavist]] Alexander Budilovich who believed that the Codex was written in northern Albania, in northern Macedonia or Mount Athos, in Bulgarian language environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book457608/#page/221/mode/1up Будилович, А. Мариинское евангелие с примечаниями и приложениями // ЖМНПр, 1884, март, с. 157.] According to Budilovich, the language of the Codex has only "small Serbian impurities".&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Bulgarian researcher [[Lyubomir Miletich]] analysing some dialectal characteristics, claimed Western Bulgarian origin (from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]) of the Codex.&lt;ref&gt;Милетич, Любомир. Особеностите на езика на Марийнския паметник, Периодическо списание на Българското книжовно дружество в Средец, година V, 1886 г., кн. 19-20. [https://archive.org/stream/periodicheskosp04druzgoog#page/n239/mode/2up 219-252]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later researchers as [[Josip Hamm]] has warned that vocalization of [[yer]]s (''ъ'' &gt; ''o'', ''ь'' &gt; ''e''), as well as the occasional disappearance of epenthetic ''l'', suggests Macedonian provenience. According to [[F. Curta]], the book was "certainly of Macedonian origin", written "either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=PA285|title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250|author=Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|ISBN=0521815398|page=285|quote=Although one of them was found in the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God on Mount Athos (hence its name, Codex Marianus), both were written in Glagolitic either in Ohrid or in one of the monastic centers in the region.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[H. G. Lunt]], "Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian)".&lt;ref name=Lunt&gt;{{cite book|author=Horace Gray Lunt|year=2001|title=Old Church Slavonic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BXJgfIo_fYC&amp;pg=PA7|quote=The Codex Marianus (Mar) has 174 folia, containing the Gospel text from Mt 5:23 to John 21:7. Certain deviations from the theoretical norms indicate Macedonian influences, others possibly Serbian (if not northern Macedonian).}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of arguments that link the Codex Marianus with territory that bordered that of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Monastic Traditions: Selected Proceedings of the Fourth International Hilandar Conference, the Ohio State University, 14–15 August 1998, Charles E. Gribble, Predrag Matejić Издание, Slavica, 2003, {{ISBN|0893573124}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to answer whether the Codex was created before the end of the First Bulgarian Empire (1018), or after its Byzantine conquest, i.e. into the [[theme of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-P_huGq9mV4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Codex+Marianus+bulgarian+empire&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL74UajCFMG-PISBgZAO&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Codex%20Marianus%20bulgarian%20empire&amp;f=false Slavic Scriptures: The Formation of the Church Slavonic Version of the Holy Bible, Henry R.

'''Creampie''' (also known as '''internal [[ejaculation]]''' and, in [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] contexts, as '''breeding''' and '''seeding''') is a [[sexual act]], commonly featured in [[pornography]], in which a male [[Ejaculation|ejaculates]] inside his partner's [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]] without use of a [[condom]], resulting in visible seeping or dripping of [[semen]] from the vagina or anus.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular modernity in America: experience, technology, mythohistory|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|author=Michael Thomas Carroll |year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzSrmR1PRO0C|isbn=978-0-7914-4713-0|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|author1=Eric Partridge |author2=Tom Dalzell |author3=Terry Victor |year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YfsEgHLjboC|isbn=978-0-415-25937-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creed&gt;{{cite book|title=Media matrix: sexing the new reality|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]|author=Barbara Creed |year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhMBgOzMUpQC|isbn=978-1-86508-926-3|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in pornography==
[[File:Creampie drawing 1-2.png|thumb|Creampie: semen flowing out of a woman's vagina after sexual activity without a [[condom]]]]
Internal ejaculation shots are a comparatively recent development in pornography; they are not found in early pornographic films.&lt;ref name="Thompson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave Thompson |title=Black and white and blue: adult cinema from the Victorian age to the VCR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBP6yjQwT8QC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=13 December 2010|date=1 September 2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-791-8|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''creampie'' to describe such scenes originated in U.S. pornography in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt;&lt;ref name="DalzellPartridge2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Dalzell|author2=Eric Partridge|title=The Routledge dictionary of modern American slang and unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5F-YNZRv-VMC&amp;pg=PA248|accessdate=29 September 2010|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-37182-7|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal ejaculations, followed by images of semen dripping from the anus, are sometimes depicted in [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] [[gay pornography]], where they are referred to by the term ''breeding'' or the ''reverse [[cum shot|money shot]]''.&lt;ref name="Dean2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Dean|authorlink=Tim Dean|title=Unlimited intimacy: reflections on the subculture of barebacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TA9YJ-QHn8C&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=29 September 2010|date=1 June 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13939-5|pages=85, 135–136, 169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean144"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Dean|authorlink=Tim Dean|title=Unlimited intimacy: reflections on the subculture of barebacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TA9YJ-QHn8C&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=29 September 2010|date=1 June 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13939-5|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding is sometimes followed by [[felching]], which involves sucking the semen from the partner's anus.&lt;ref name="Dean2009" /&gt;

In straight pornography, sexual activity is often followed by a [[facial (sex act)|facial]], [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] or other visible ejaculation.&lt;ref name="Dean2009" /&gt; Creampie scenes depart from heterosexual pornographic convention in favor of a depiction that more closely mimics sexual activity as performed in ordinary life;&lt;ref name="Dean2009" /&gt; they have been called the "counterimage" of facials.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; Perhaps following the example set by gay pornography, they have become a popular subgenre within heterosexual pornography since the turn of the century, featuring both vaginal and anal ejaculations.&lt;ref name="DalzellPartridge2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kick /&gt; In some creampie films, both gay and straight, sexual activity, including internal ejaculation, are followed by performers licking up the semen that has dripped from their bodies.&lt;ref name="DalzellPartridge2008" /&gt;  Some pornographic films use an artificial semen substitute to simulate or enhance creampie shots.&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Creed/&gt;

Examples of heterosexual pornographic film series featuring creampies include ''Cream Filled Teens'' and ''Internal Cumbustion''.&lt;ref name=Kick&gt;{{cite book|title=Disinformation book of lists: subversive facts and hidden information in rapid-fire format|publisher=[[The Disinformation Company]]|author=[[Russ Kick|Russell Kick]] |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utssHzXYsWoC|isbn=978-0-9729529-4-1|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In male homosexual pornography, [[Treasure Island Media]] is a notable representative, its title ''Breed Me'' (1999) having been noted as one of the "earliest and most notorious" in the genre.&lt;ref name="Dean2009" /&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}

Popularized by the American sociologist [[Barry Glassner]], '''culture of fear''' (or '''climate of fear''') is the concept that people may incite [[fear]] in the general public to achieve political or workplace goals through [[emotional bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffery|title=Filtering the news: essays on Herman and [[Chomsky]]'s propaganda model|year=2005|publisher=[[Black Rose Books]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A largely unrelated concept in sociology is the "fear culture" on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other.  An [[Authoritarian leadership style|authoritarian style of leadership]] may create a climate of fear, with little or no room for dialogue and with complaining being considered futile.&lt;ref&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying"  in 
Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of [[public-sector union]] members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place.  Rayner explained the figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had been tolerated previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

Individual differences in sensitivity to [[Reward system|reward]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and [[motivation]] have been studied under the premises of [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] and have also been [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory#Workplace performance|applied to workplace performance]].

A culture of fear at the workplace runs contrary to the "key principles" established by [[W. Edwards Deming]] for managers to transform business effectiveness.  One of his [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|fourteen principles]] is to drive out fear in order to allow everyone to work effectively for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points|title=The W.

Nazi leader [[Hermann Göring]] explains how people can be made fearful and to support a war they otherwise would oppose:

{{quote|The people don't want [[war]], but they can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  This is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and [[denunciation|denounce]] the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in every country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]] (1947) ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book "State and Opposition in Military Brazil," Maria Helena Moreira Alves found a "culture of fear" was implemented as part of [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|political repression since 1964]].  She used the term to describe methods implemented by the [[national security]] apparatus of Brazil in its effort to equate political participation with risk of [[arrest]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alves|first1=Maria|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|date=1985|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Brazil|page=352|accessdate=14 June 2015|ref=Alves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassação (English: cassation) is one such mechanism used to punish members of the military by legally declaring them dead.  This enhanced the potential for political control through intensifying the culture of fear as a deterrent to opposition.&lt;ref name=Alves1&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves found the changes of the [[National Security Law (Brazil)|National Security Law]] of 1969, as beginning the use of "[[economic exploitation]], physical [[political repression|repression]], political control, and strict [[censorship]]" to establish a "culture of fear" in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Alves2&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three psychological components of the culture of fear included silence through censorship, sense of isolation, and a "generalized belief that all channels of opposition were closed."  A "feeling of complete [[hopelessness]]," prevailed, in addition to  "withdrawal from opposition activity."&lt;ref name=Alves3&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former US National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] argues that the use of the term [[War on Terror]] was intended to generate a culture of fear deliberately because it "obscures reason, intensifies emotions and makes it easier for [[demagogic]] politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html |title=Terrorized by 'War on Terror' by Brzezinski |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= March 25, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecC12&gt;{{cite news

[[Frank Furedi]], a former professor of Sociology and writer for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' magazine, says that today's culture of fear did not begin with the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  Long before September 11, he argues, public [[panic]]s were widespread – on everything from [[GM crops]] to mobile phones, from [[global warming]] to [[foot-and-mouth disease]].  Like Durodié, Furedi argues that perceptions of risk, ideas about safety and controversies over health, the environment and technology have little to do with science or [[empirical evidence]].  Rather, they are shaped by cultural assumptions about human [[vulnerability]].  Furedi say that "we need a grown-up discussion about our post-September 11 world, based on a reasoned evaluation of all the available evidence rather than on [[irrational]] fears for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Furedi |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D46C.htm |title=Epidemic of fear |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British academics Gabe Mythen and Sandra Walklate argue that following terrorist attacks in New York, the Pentagon, Madrid, and London, government agencies developed a discourse of "new terrorism" in a cultural climate of [[fear, uncertainty and doubt|fear and uncertainty]].  UK researchers argued that these processes reduced notions of [[public safety]] and created the [[simplistic]] image of a non-white "terroristic other" that has negative consequences for ethnic minority groups in the UK.&lt;ref name="Gabe Mythen1 and Sandra Walklate"&gt;[http://cmc.sagepub.com/content/2/2/123.abstract#aff-1 Communicating the terrorist risk: Harnessing a culture of fear?] Gabe Mythen [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], UK, Sandra Walklate [[University of Liverpool]], UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 BBC documentary film series, ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', subtitled ''The Rise of the Politics of Fear'', the journalist [[Adam Curtis]] argues that politicians have used our fears to increase their power and control over society.  Though he does not use the term "culture of fear," what Curtis describes in his film is a reflection of this concept.  He looks at the American [[neo-conservative]] movement and its depiction of the [[threat]] first from the [[Soviet Union]] and then from radical [[Islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="bbcpower"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Power of Nightmares: Your comments |newspaper=[[BBC]] |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/4016713.stm |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis insists there has been a largely illusory fear of terrorism in the west since the [[September 11 attacks]] and that politicians such as [[George W Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] had stumbled on a new force to restore their power and authority; using the fear of an organised "web of evil" from which they could protect their people.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"&gt;{{cite news |title=The film US TV networks dare not show |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/12/cannes2005.cannesfilmfestival4 |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtis's film castigated the media, security forces and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] for expanding their power in this way.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"/&gt; The film features [[Bill Durodié]], then Director of the International Centre for Security Analysis, and Senior [[Research Fellow]] in the International Policy Institute, [[King's College London]], saying that to call this network an "invention" would be too strong a term, but he asserts that it probably does not exist and is largely a "([[psychological projection|projection]]) of our own worst fears, and that what we see is a fantasy that's been created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html|title=Exploring The Best Pro hormone Stacks|website=www.daanspeak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the media  ==
The consumption of mass media has had a profound effect on instilling the fear of terrorism in the United States, though acts of terror are a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nellis|first=Ashley Marie|last2=Savage|first2=Joanne|date=2012-09-10|title=Does Watching the News Affect Fear of Terrorism?

According to Gerbner, television and other forms of mass media create a worldview that is reflective of “recurrent media messages”, rather than one that is based on reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93|journal=Sociological Perspectives|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Americans are exposed to some form of media on a daily basis, with television and social media platforms being the most used methods to receive both local and international news, and as such this is how most receive news and details that center around violent crime and acts of terror.  With the rise in use of smartphones and social media, people are bombarded with constant news updates, and able to read stories related to terrorism, stories that come from all corners of the globe.  Media fuels fear of terrorism and other threats to national security, all of which have negative psychological effects on the population, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Politicians conduct interviews, televised or otherwise, and utilize their social media platforms immediately after violent crimes and terrorist acts, to further cement the fear of terrorism into the minds of their constituents.

==Life and work==
Born in [[Salisbury (Rhodesia)|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] to South African parents, Brutus was of indigenous Khoi, Dutch, French, English, German and Malaysian ancestry. His parents moved back home to [[Port Elizabeth]] when he was aged four, and young Brutus was classified under [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] racial code as "coloured".&lt;ref name="DBT01"&gt;[https://books.google.lu/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC "The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography"], ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brutus was a graduate of the [[University of Fort Hare]] (BA, 1946) and of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], where he studied law. He taught English and [[Afrikaans]] at several high schools in South Africa after 1948, but was eventually dismissed for his vocal criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith A. P. Sandiford]], ''A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora'', [[Hansib Publications]], 2008, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the faculty of the [[University of Denver]], [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University Course Bulletin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bond&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/brutus261209.html |title=Dennis Vincent Brutus, 1924–2009 |publisher=mrzine.monthlyreview.org |accessdate=2009-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/tags/dennis_brutus |publisher=''Democracy Now!'' |title=Dennis Brutus |accessdate=26 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/world/africa/03brutus.html?hpw "Dennis Brutus Dies at 85; Fought Apartheid With Sports"], ''The New York Times'', 2 January 2010 (3 January 2009, p.

In 2008, Brutus was awarded the Lifetime Honorary Award by the South African Department of Arts and Culture for his lifelong dedication to African and world poetry and literary arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Poetry-and-Protest-A-Dennis-Brutus-Reader ''Poetry and Protest: A Dennis Brutus Reader''].

[[File:Dennis Brutus (1967).jpg|thumbnail|left|Dennis Brutus during a press conference at Schiphol Airport, 1967]]

===Activist===
Brutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1960s. He learned politics in the [[Trotsky]]ist movement of the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dennis+Brutus:+a+memorial+statement.-a0219588353|title=Dennis Brutus: a memorial statement. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between [[Black people|blacks]] and [[coloureds]].

Brutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that would be heavily influential in the banning of [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics]] in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC.  As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"&gt;George Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain: Glimpses of Africa's Freedom Struggle''(New York: Pilgrim Press, 1989), 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and jail===
In 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his "banning," which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he "jumped bail" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while in [[Mozambique]], on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to [[Robben Island]] ... for 16 months, five in solitary." He was in the cell next to [[Nelson Mandela]]'s. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]], for which he had campaigned, broke.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;

Brutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, ''Sirens, Knuckles and Boots'', was published in [[Nigeria]] while he was in prison. The book received the [[The Mbari Club|Mbari Poetry Prize]], awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of 14 books.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

===Release from jail===
After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in the  [[United Kingdom|Britain]],where he first met [[George Houser]], the Executive Director of the [[American Committee on Africa]] (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour; where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organizations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defense of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa  which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games.  In cooperation with SANROC, the ACOA organized a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  [[Jackie Robinson]], the first African American athlete to break to color barrier in [[Major League Baseball]], published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. Asa result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Announcing Dennis Brutus," found at: http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-B92 [accessed on 27 October 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Statement by Jackie Robinson and K.C.

In 1983, Brutus won the right to stay in the [[United States]] as a political refugee, after a protracted legal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Clendenin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/us/black-poet-an-exile-for-10-years-battles-us-deportation-to-africa.html "Black poet, an exile for 10 years, battles U.S. Deportation to Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 14 January 1982.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was "unbanned" by the South African government in 1990. In 1991 he became one of the sponsors of the [[Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAFA Newsletter|journal=CAFA Newsletter|date=1991|volume=Fall 1991|issue=2|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to South Africa, poetry and activism===
He returned to South Africa and was based at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]], where he often contributed to the annual [[Poetry Africa]] Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with [[NGO]]s. 
In December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. 
At the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: 

{{quote|It is incompatible to have those who championed racist sport alongside its genuine victims. It's time—indeed long past time—for sports truth, apologies and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Weekly'', 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to fellow writer [[Olu Oguibe]], interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the [[University of Connecticut]], "Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]] and [[Christopher Okigbo]], certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher."

Brutus died of [[prostate cancer]] on 26 December 2009, at his home in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7edc02ba-f73d-11de-9fb5-00144feab49a.html |title=Poet, political prisoner and a campaigner to the end |publisher=www.ft.com|author= Martin, Jurek|date=2 January 2010&lt;!-- 02:00 --&gt;|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, was published in 2011, including transcripts of tapes recorded when he was a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1974–75, reflecting on his life and career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Dennis_Brutus_Tapes.html?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''], James Currey/Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2011, {{isbn|9781847010346}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dilemma''' ({{lang-grc-gre|δίλημμα}} "double [[lemma (logic)|proposition]]") is a [[problem]] offering two possibilities, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The possibilities are termed the ''horns'' of the dilemma, a [[cliché]]d usage, but distinguishing the dilemma from other kinds of predicament as a matter of usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199888771 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA257 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dilemmatic arguments==
The dilemma is sometimes used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Its isolation as textbook material has been attributed to [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] in his work ''On Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Calboli Montefusco, ''Rhetorical use of dilemmatic arguments'', Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric Vol. 28, No. 4 (Autumn 2010), pp. 363–383, at p. 364. Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. DOI: 10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363 {{jstor|10.1525/rh.2010.28.4.363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Peirce]] gave a definition of ''dilemmatic argument'' as any argument relying on [[excluded middle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sujata |last2=Prasad |first2=Sanjiva |title=Logic and Its Applications: 7th Indian Conference, ICLA 2017, Kanpur, India, January 5-7, 2017, Proceedings |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662540695 |page=177 note 5|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=etrJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion, and applied incorrectly, it constitutes a [[false dichotomy]], that is, a [[fallacy]]. Traditional usage distinguished the dilemma as a "horned syllogism" from the [[sophism]] that attracted the Latin name ''cornutus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Sir William |title=The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, Bart |date=1863 |publisher=Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rUEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original use of the word ''horns'' in English has been attributed to [[Nicholas Udall]] in his 1548 book ''Paraphrases'', translating from the Latin term ''cornuta interrogatio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erasmus |first1=Desiderius |title=Paraphrase on Luke 11-24 |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802036537 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q9ZLk_Qw0ZQC&amp;pg=PA158 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In logic==
In [[propositional logic]], ''dilemma'' is applied to a group of [[rules of inference]], which are in themselves valid rather than fallacious. They each have three premises, and include the [[constructive dilemma]] and [[destructive dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Church |first1=Alonzo |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |date=1996 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691029067 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JDLQOMKbdScC&amp;pg=PA105 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments can be refuted by showing that the disjunctive premise — the "horns of the dilemma" — does not in fact hold, because it presents a false dichotomy. You are asked to accept "A or B", but counter by showing that is not all. Successfully undermining that premise is called "escaping through the horns of the dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Govier |first1=Trudy |title=A Practical Study of Argument |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0495603406 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUxXbUvDiswC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Dilemmatic reasoning has been attributed to [[Melissus of Samos]], a [[Presocratic]] philosopher whose works survive in fragmentary form, making the origins of the technique in philosophy imponderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harriman |first1=Benjamin |title=Melissus and Eleatic Monism |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108416337 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e091DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established with [[Diodorus Cronus]] (died c. 284 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sedley |first1=David |title=Diodorus Cronus |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/diodorus-cronus |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxes of [[Zeno of Elea]] were reported by [[Aristotle]] in dilemma form, but that may have been to conform with what [[Plato]] said about Zeno's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=John |title=Zeno of Elea |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and ethical dilemmas==
{{main|ethical dilemma}}
In cases where two [[moral principle]]s appear to be inconsistent, an actor has a dilemma in terms of which principle to follow. This kind of moral case study is attributed to [[Cicero]], in book III of his ''[[De Officiis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA75 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian tradition of [[casuistry]], an approach to abstract ranking of principles introduced by [[Bartolomé de Medina (theologian)|Bartolomé de Medina]] in the 16th century became tainted with the accusation of [[laxism]], as did casuistry itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peters |first1=Francis E. |title=The words and will of God |date=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691114617 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=26aSVSICGIEC&amp;pg=PA154 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, with legal roots, is to lay emphasis on particular features present in a given case: in other words, the exact framing of the dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jonsen |first1=Albert R. |last2=Toulmin |first2=Stephen Edelston |title=The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520060630 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RNipCKHdnlsC&amp;pg=PA54 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Discharge pipe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wastewater]] discharge]]
'''Effluent''' is an outflowing of water or gas to a natural body of water, from a structure such as a [[wastewater treatment plant]], [[Sewerage|sewer pipe]], or industrial outfall. Effluent, in engineering, is the stream exiting a [[chemical reactor]].&lt;ref&gt; Scott Fogler, ''Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering'', page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Effluent is defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as "''wastewater - treated or untreated - that flows out of a treatment plant, sewer, or industrial outfall. Generally refers to wastes discharged into surface waters''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/eterms.html |title=Terms of Environment Beginning With "E"    |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-06-09 |date=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines effluent as "''liquid waste or sewage discharged into a river or the sea''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/effluent?view=uk |title=AskOxford: effluent |work=Ask Oxford.com |publisher=Oxford University Press, |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effluent in the artificial sense is in general considered to be [[water pollution]], such as the outflow from a [[sewage treatment]] facility or the [[wastewater]] discharge from industrial facilities. An effluent [[sump pump]], for instance, pumps waste from toilets installed below a main sewage line. Similar to wastewater produced in different establishments, industries, and facilities. These wastewater released can also accumulate and pollute the nearby communities and bodies of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canencia|first=Oliva P|last2=Dalugdug|first2=Marlou D|last3=Emano|first3=Athena Marie|last4=Mendoza|first4=Richard|last5=Walag|first5=Angelo Mark P.|date=2016-08-31|title=Slaughter waste effluents and river catchment watershed contamination in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307931158_Slaughter_waste_effluents_and_river_catchment_watershed_contamination_in_Cagayan_de_Oro_City_Philippines | journal=ResearchGate | volume=9 | issue=2 | issn=2220-6663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[waste water treatment plants]], effluent that has been treated is sometimes called ''secondary effluent'', or ''treated effluent''.  This cleaner effluent is then used to feed the [[bacteria]] in [[biofilters]].

In the context of a [[thermal power station]], the output of the cooling system may be referred to as the effluent cooling water, which is noticeably warmer than the environment.  Effluent only refers to liquid discharge.  

In [[sugar beet]] processing, effluent is often settled in water tanks that allow the mud-contaminated water to settle. The mud sinks to the bottom, leaving the top section of water clear, free to be pumped back into the river or be reused in the process again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">[[File:Euchologium Sinaiticum 1N, fol. 1r.jpg|thumb|right|Fragment rediscovered in 1975 (Sin. slav. 1/N, f.1r)]]
The '''Euchologium Sinaiticum''' is a 109-folio [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|Canon of Old Church Slavonic]] [[euchologium]]. It contains parts of the liturgy of the St. [[John Chrysostom]], and is dated to the 11th century.

== Manuscripts ==
Part of the manuscript was found in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]] in 1850 by the Russian [[archimandrite]] [[Porphyrius Uspensky]] ([[#SinSl37|Sin. slav. 37]]), and there it's still kept today excepting the three folios taken by Uspenskij and N.P. Krylov to Saint Petersburg, Russia ([[National Library of Russia|NLR]] Ms. глаг. 2 &amp; 3). Among the Sinai manuscripts discovered in 1975 is a 28-folio fragment of the Euchologium Sinaiticum (Sin. slav. 1/N).

== Editions ==
It was first published by Czech L. Geitler in 1882 in Zagreb. In the edition ''[[Patrologia Orientalis]]'' (t. XXIV, fasc. 5, 1933, p. 605-802 and t. XXV, fasc. 3, 1939, p. 487-617) it was published by J. Frček. Slovene Slavist R. Nahtigal published a facsimile edition it in Ljubljana in 1941, and in 1942 in a Cyrillic transcription. A facsimile edition of the recent discoveries of Euchologium fragmenta has been published by I. C. Tarnanidis: ''The Slavonic Manuscripts Discovered in 1975. at St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai'' (Thessaloniki, 1988).

== Context ==
Researchers emphasize that the manuscript is a collection of diverse prayers of different origins: some of them are scribed to the pre-Cyrillo-Methodian Salzburg mission, and for others it's being claimed that they represent Eastern-rite missal fragments. We don't know much of its language: nasal vowels are well-preserved, there is no notation of palatalism in syllabic sonorants ''r'' and ''l'', strong [[yer]]s are sometimes preserved, and sometimes vocalized (''ъ'' &gt; ''o'', ''ь'' &gt; ''e''), weak yers are sometimes omitted, [[Jagić's rule]] is confirmed etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8492">In [[philosophy of mind]] and [[consciousness]], the '''explanatory gap''' is the difficulty that [[physicalism|physicalist]] theories have in explaining how physical properties give rise to the way things feel when they are experienced. It is a term introduced by philosopher [[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]].&lt;ref name=Levine1983 /&gt; In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, "Pain is the firing of [[C fibers]]", pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels.

The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued [[philosopher]]s and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and [[qualia]]) is known as "[[Hard problem of consciousness|the hard problem]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Chalmers]], [http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf ''Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness''], [http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html JCS, 2 (3), 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514060312/http://www.imprint.co.uk/hardprob.html |date=2011-05-14 }}, pp. 200-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

To take an example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap, imagine a modern computer: as marvelous as these devices are, their behavior can be fully explained by their circuitry. By contrast, it is thought by many [[Mind-body dualism|mind-body dualists]] (e.g. [[René Descartes]], [[David Chalmers]]) that ''subjective conscious experience'' constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance [[quantum mind]], [[indirect realism]]).

Proponents of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] claim that the [[mind]] is substantially and qualitatively different from the [[brain]] and that the existence of something [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] extra-physical is required to "fill the gap".  Similarly, some argue that there are [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world—about conscious experience. For example, they argue that [[qualia|what it is like]] to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world.

The nature of the explanatory gap has been the subject of some debate.  For example, some consider it to simply be a limit on our current explanatory ability.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C. 1991. Consciousness Explained. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap.  However, others have taken a stronger position and argued that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans—no amount of further information will allow us to close it.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. 1989. “Can we solve the mind-body problem?” Mind, 98: 349-66&lt;/ref&gt;  There has also been no consensus regarding what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides.  Those wishing to use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap—particularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities—necessarily entails a metaphysical gap.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine and others have wished to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn.&lt;ref name=Levine1983&gt;Levine, J. 1983. “Materialism and qualia: the explanatory gap”. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64: 354-361.&lt;/ref&gt;  He agrees that conceivability (as used in the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie]] and [[inverted spectrum]] arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but he points out that even if we come to the ''metaphysical'' conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an ''explanatory'' problem.
&lt;blockquote&gt;While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, such an [[epistemological]] or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;J. Levine, "Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap" in  Stuart R. Hameroff, Alfred W. Kaszniak and David Chalmers (eds.), ''Towards a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson Discussions and Debates'', The MIT Press, 1999,. pp 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we don't even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we're exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that, as qualitative experience of a physical or functional state may simply be such a brute fact, perhaps we should consider whether or not it is really necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience.

Levine points out that the solution to the problem of understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we also lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He does conclude that there are good reasons why we wish for a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One very significant reason is that consciousness appears to only manifest where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. This, of course, may be indicative of a human capacity for reasoning that is no more than the result of organized functions. Levine expresses that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that although, at minimum, Materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism doesn't attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology.

'''Exopolysaccharides''' (also sometimes abbreviated '''EPSs''') are high-molecular-weight polymers that are composed of sugar residues and are secreted by a [[microorganism]] into the surrounding environment. Microorganisms synthesize a wide spectrum of multifunctional [[polysaccharide]]s including intracellular polysaccharides, structural polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides or exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides generally consist of monosaccharides and some non-carbohydrate substituents (such as [[acetate]], [[pyruvate]], [[succinate]], and [[phosphate]]). Owing to the wide diversity in composition, exopolysaccharides have found multifarious applications in various food and pharmaceutical industries. Many microbial EPSs provide properties that are almost identical to the [[Natural gum|gum]]s currently in use. With innovative approaches, efforts are underway to supersede the traditionally used plant and algal gums by their microbial counterparts. Moreover, considerable progress has been made in discovering and developing new microbial EPSs that possess novel [[industrial significance]].&lt;ref name=10suresh&gt;{{cite book |author=Suresh and Mody|year=2009|chapter=Microbial Exopolysaccharides: Variety and Potential Applications|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Capsular exopolysaccharides can protect pathogenic bacteria against desiccation and predation, and contribute to their pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria existing in biofilms are less vulnerable compared to planktonic bacteria, as the EPS matrix is able to act as a protective diffusion barrier.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harimawan|first=Ardiyan|last2=Ting|first2=Yen-Peng|date=2016-10-01|title=Investigation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) properties of P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis and their role in bacterial adhesion|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776516304696|journal=Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces|volume=146|issue=Supplement C|pages=459–467|doi=10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical and chemical characteristics of bacterial cells can be affected by EPS composition, influencing factors such as cellular recognition, aggregation, and adhesion in their natural environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the EPS layer acts as a nutrient trap, facilitating bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The exopolysaccharides of some strains of lactic acid bacteria, e.g., [[Lactococcus lactis]] subsp. cremoris, contribute a gelatinous texture to fermented milk products (e.g., [[Viili]]), and these polysaccharides are also digestible.&lt;ref name="WelmanAD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Welman AD|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5|chapter=Exploitation of Exopolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LjunghWadstrom2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics|author=Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example for industrial use of exopolysaccharides is the application of dextran in panettone and other breads in the bakery industry.&lt;ref name="UllrichM2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Ullrich M (editor)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
Exopolysaccharides can facilitate the attachment of [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] to plant roots and soil particles, which mediates a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important for colonization of roots and the [[rhizosphere]], which is a key component of soil food webs and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. It also allows for successful invasion and infection of the host plant.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bacterial extracellular polymeric substances can aid in [[bioremediation]] of heavy metals as they have the capacity to adsorb metal cations, among other dissolved substances.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pal|first=Arundhati|last2=Paul|first2=A. K.|date=2008-03-01|title=Microbial extracellular polymeric substances: central elements in heavy metal bioremediation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|issn=0046-8991|pmc=3450203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be useful in the treatment of wastewater systems, as biofilms are able to bind to and remove metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and cadmium.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The binding affinity and metal specificity of EPS varies depending on polymer composition, as well as environmental factors such as concentration and pH.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In a [[Geomicrobiology|geomicrobiological]] context, EPS has been observed to affect precipitation of minerals, particularly [[Carbonate|carbonates]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tourney|first=Janette|last2=Ngwenya|first2=Bryne T.|date=2014-10-29|title=The role of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances in geomicrobiology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254114003842|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=386|issue=Supplement C|pages=115–132|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPS may also bind to and trap particles in biofilm suspensions, which can restrict dispersion and element cycling.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Sediment stability can be increased by EPS, as it influences cohesion, permeability, and erosion of the sediment.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There is evidence that the adhesion and metal-binding ability of EPS affects mineral leaching rates in both environmental and industrial contexts.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These interactions between EPS and the abiotic environment allow for EPS to largely impact [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]].

=== Novel industrial use ===
Due to the growing need to find a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional waste removal methods, industries are paying more attention to the function of bacteria and their EPSs in [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mota|first=Rita|last2=Rossi|first2=Federico|last3=Andrenelli|first3=Luisa|last4=Pereira|first4=Sara Bernardes|last5=De Philippis|first5=Roberto|date=September 2016|title=Released polysaccharides (RPS) from Cyanothece sp.

Researchers found that adding EPSs from [[cyanobacteria]] to [[Wastewater|wastewaters]] removes heavy metals such as copper, cadmium and lead.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;EPSs alone can physically interact with these heavy metals and take them in through [[biosorption]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The efficiency of removal can be optimized by treating the EPSs with different acids or bases first before adding them to the wastewaters.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Contaminated soils contain high levels of [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs); EPSs from two bacteria, [[Zoogloea|''Zoogloea'' sp]]. and&amp;nbsp; ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'', are efficient at removing these toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Chunyun|last2=Li|first2=Peijun|last3=Li|first3=Xiaojun|last4=Tai|first4=Peidong|last5=Liu|first5=Wan|last6=Gong|first6=Zongqiang|date=2011-08-01|title=Degradation of pyrene in soils by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from liquid cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511311001644|journal=Process Biochemistry|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1627–1631|doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;EPSs contain enzymes such as [[oxidoreductase]] and [[hydrolase]], which are capable of&amp;nbsp; degrading PAHs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The amount of PAHs degradation depends on the concentration of EPSs added to the soil. This method proves to be low cost and highly efficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

In recent years, EPSs from marine bacteria have been found to speed up the cleanup of oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutierrez|first=Tony|last2=Berry|first2=David|last3=Yang|first3=Tingting|last4=Mishamandani|first4=Sara|last5=McKay|first5=Luke|last6=Teske|first6=Andreas|last7=Aitken|first7=Michael D.|date=2013-06-27|title=Role of Bacterial Exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the Fate of the Oil Released during the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e67717|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in 2010, these EPS-producing bacteria were able to grow and multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It was later found that their EPSs dissolved the oil and formed oil aggregates on the ocean surface, which sped up the cleaning process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These oil aggregates also &amp;nbsp;provided a valuable source of nutrients for other marine microbial communities. This let scientists modify and optimize the use of EPSs to clean up oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major. Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1. The Fugue is Generative|url=http://bach.nau.edu/clavier/nature/fugues/Fugue09.html|publisher=NAU.edu|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[serialism]] follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lerdahl|Lerdahl, Fred]]. 1988. "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems". In ''Generative Processes in Music'', ed. John Sloboda. Oxford University Press. Reprinted in ''Contemporary Music Review'' 6, no. 2 (1992):97–121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred, and [[Ray Jackendoff]]. 1983. ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calmoduline Monument.jpg|thumb|''Calmoduline Monument'', by [[Jean-Max Albert]], 1991]]

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]]. [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]] system is a longstanding project combining software artificial intelligence with robotic painting devices to create physical artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/hi_cohenbio.html Biography of Harold Cohen] [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting [[evolutionary computing]] to create visual form include those created by [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]].
The digital artist [[Joseph Nechvatal]] has exploited models of viral contagion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wands ''Art of the Digital Age'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Autopoiesis'' by [[Ken Rinaldo]] includes fifteen musical and [[robotic]] sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviors based on both the presence of the participants and each other.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|144–145}}
[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
[[Michael Noll|A. Michael Noll]], of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “The Digital Computer as a Creative Medium,” IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 4, No. 10, (October 1967), pp. 89-95; and “Computers and the Visual Arts,” Design and Planning 2: Computers in Design and Communication (Edited by Martin Krampen and Peter Seitz), Hastings House, Publishers, Inc.: New York (1967), pp. 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;
The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurizio Bolognini]] works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini, ''De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital''  ([http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art]), in {{citation|title= Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l’art contemporain|year=2011|author=Actes du Colloque international Artmedia X|language=French|publisher=L’Harmattan|location=Paris|isbn=9782296132306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] pushed this theme further, transforming "data sets" as diverse as musical scores (in "Shape of Song", 2001) and Wikipedia edits ([[History Flow]], 2003, with [[Fernanda Viegas]]) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist [[San Base]] developed a "Dynamic Painting" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as "brush strokes," Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbasestudio.com/about.htm San Base: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Architecture===
In 1987 [[Celestino Soddu]] created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Celestino Soddu [http://www.soddu.it/progetti/med.htm Soddu: "Italian Medieval Town"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/complexism_chapter.pdf ''Complexism and the role of evolutionary art''] in "The art of artificial evolution : a handbook on evolutionary art and music", Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Americans accept no law other than their own on US soil, yet expect other nations to submit to the rule of US troops; a [[double standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[drone strikes]] on terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan goes against the presumption of innocence. The CIA, exempt from the [[Geneva Convention]], is 'secretly sentencing people to death for an unproven crime, without trial or inquest.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Robertson]], 'Drone attacks go against every Human Right in the book', [[New Statesman]], 13/6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] is not a state, so 'war law' which permits killing of combatants, does not apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">The '''Hexateuch''' ("six scrolls") is the first six books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:  the [[Torah]] (''[[Pentateuch]]'') and the [[book of Joshua]].&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Hexateuch'' came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by [[Abraham Kuenen]] and [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{Cite NIE |last=Schmidt |first=Nathaniel |authorlink=Nathaniel Schmidt |wstitle=Hexateuch |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], [[Wilhelm de Wette|de Wette]], [[Karl Heinrich Graf|Graf]], [[Abraham Kuenen|Kuenen]], [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]], [[John William Colenso|Colenso]] and others, in his ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern [[Yahwist]] source (''c'' 950 BC), detached from  JE document by the [[Deuteronomist]] (''c'' 650&amp;ndash;621) and incorporated into the [[Deuteronomic history]], with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.

Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the ''Book of Joshua'' stresses the continuity of leadership from [[Moses]] to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of ''Joshua'', the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.

The thesis that ''Joshua'' completes the ''Torah'' in a ''Hexateuch'' may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the ''Pentateuch'' is a complete work in itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by [[Eduard Meyer]] (1855–1930) that there never was any ''Hexateuch'' per se, but that the ''Law'', ''Joshua'', ''Judges'', ''Samuel'', and ''Kings'' once formed one great historic work.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;

In the [[Christian]] tradition, '''holy cards''' or '''prayer cards''' are small, [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] pictures [[Mass production|mass-produced]] for the use of the faithful. They usually depict a religious scene or a [[saint]] in an image about the size of a [[playing card]]. The reverse typically contains a [[prayer]], some of which promise an [[indulgence]] for its recitation. The circulation of these cards is an important part of the visual [[folk culture]] of Roman Catholics, and in modern times, prayer cards have also become popular among Orthodox Christians and Protestant Christians, although with the latter, biblical themes are emphasized within them.&lt;ref name="Hasinoff2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasinoff|first=Erin L.|title=Faith in Objects: American Missionary Expositions in the Early Twentieth Century|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230339729|page=206|quote=Protestant prayer cards tended to emphasize biblical themes as opposed to devotional subjects (Leonard Primiano, personal communication, 2011).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illes2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Illes|first=Judika|title=Encyclopedia of Mystics, Saints &amp; Sages|date=2011-10-11|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062098542|page=68|quote=In recent years, holy cards have become increasingly popular among Orthodox Christians as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old master prints==
[[File:Maestro di flemalle, forse robert campin, annunciazione, 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Annunciation by Robert Campin; [[Woodblock printing|wood print]] is top right, between candle fixtures.]]
[[Old master print]]s, nearly all on religious subjects, served many of the same functions as holy cards, especially the cheaper [[woodcut]]s; the earliest dated surviving example is from 1423, probably from southern Germany, and depicts [[Saint Christopher]], with handcolouring, it is found as part of the binding of a manuscript of the ''Laus Virginis'' (1417) which belongs to the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/guide/atoz/incunabula/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402010642/http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/guide/atoz/incunabula/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2010 |title=Incunabula |work=Guide to Special Collections |publisher=John Rylands University Library |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Rylands Library (1969) ''Catalogue of an Exhibition of Manuscripts and Early Printing Originating in Germany''. Manchester: John Rylands Library; p. 15 (gives references to Dodgson: Woodcuts; 2 &amp; Schreiber: Manuel; 1349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[engraving]] or [[etching]] were more commonly used. Some had elaborate borders of paper [[lace]] surrounding the images; these were called ''dévotes dentelles'' in France.

One use of such cards is illustrated in an early 15th-c painting of the Annunciation by [[Robert Campin]], which stages the event in a bourgeois home; above the fireplace, a print of Christopher carrying the Christ child is tacked to the wall, possibly as a more affordable alternative to a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Het hemels prentenboek: Devotie- en bidprentjes vanaf de 17e eeuw tot het begin van de 20e eeuw|publisher=Gooi en Sticht|first=J. A. J. M.|last=Verspaandonk|year=1975|location=Hilversum|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography==
The invention of colour [[lithography]] made it possible to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards.  An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of St Sulpice]] in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate [[pastel]] colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs. [[Belgium]] and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did [[Italy]] in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as [[Bayard Presse|Maison de la Bonne Presse]] in France and [[Ars Sacra]] in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.

==Special types of cards==
Special holy cards are printed for Roman Catholics to be distributed at funerals; these are "[[In memoriam card]]s", with details and often a photograph of the person whom they commemorate as well as prayers printed on the back.  Other specialized holy cards record [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]s, and other religious anniversaries.  Others are not customized, and are circulated to promote the [[veneration]] of the saints and images they bear.

At the end of the nineteenth century, some Protestants also produced similar images of their own. They produced ''Bible cards'' or ''[[Sunday school]] cards'', with lithographed illustrations depicting [[Bible stories]] and [[parable]]s, more modern scenes of religious life or prayer, or sometimes just a Biblical text illuminated by [[calligraphy]]; these were linked to Biblical passages that related to the image.  The reverse typically held a [[sermonette]] instead of a prayer. Imagery here was always the servant of text, and as such these Protestant cards tended to be replaced by [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s that emphasized message instead of imagery, and were illustrated with [[cartoon]]-like images if they were illustrated at all.

==World War II and the Cold War==
The ''[[Head of Christ]]'' painting has been printed more than 500 million times, including pocket-sized cards for carrying in a [[wallet]].&lt;ref name="Lippy1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippy|first=Charles H.|title=Being Religious, American Style: A History of Popular Religiosity in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yB1R5485dUC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313278952|page=185|quote=Of these one stands out as having deeply impressed itself of the American religious consciousness: the "Head of Christ" by artist Warner Sallman (1892-1968). Originally sketched in charcoal as a cover illustration for the ''Covenant Companion'', the magazine of the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America denomination, and based on an image of Jesus in a painting by the French artist Leon Augustin Lhermitte, Sallman's "Head of Christ" was painted in 1940. In half a century, it had been produced more than five hundred million times in formats ranging from large-scale copies for use in churches to wallet-sized ones that individuals could carry with them at all times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[World War II]] era, "millions of cards featuring the Head of Christ were distributed through the USO by the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[YMCA]] to members of the American armed forces stationed overseas".&lt;ref name="Moore2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Stephen D.|title=God's Beauty Parlor|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804743327|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], both Catholics and Protestants helped to popularize these cards, presenting "a united front against the menace of godless Communism".&lt;ref name="Prothero2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=Stephen|title=American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon|date=15 December 2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9780374178901|page=117|quote=During the postwar revival of the 1940s and 1950s, as Protestants and Catholics downplayed denominational differences in order to present a united front against the menace of godless Communism, Sallman's Jesus became far and away the most common image of Jesus in American homes, churches, and workplaces. Thanks to Sallman (and the savvy marketing of his distributors), Jesus became instantly recognizable by Americans of all races and religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish law of 2009==
In [[Ireland]], cards are sold certifying that a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] has been said for the benefit of sick or dead people, and are typically given to the family of the sick or dead person. Disputes arose over the validity of cards issued by priests living outside Ireland. Section 99 of the 2009 Charities Act regulates sales of Mass Cards, which can only be sold "pursuant to an arrangement" with a "recognised person", such as a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]], without stipulating whether that person had to be resident in Ireland or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a0609.pdf Charities Act 2009 text]&lt;/ref&gt; A court challenge to the new law by a business that sold 120,000 cards a year failed in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1217/church.html McNally case; accessed from RTE website August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of the law can result in a 10-year prison sentence or a €300,000 fine.

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

Within the German Aerospace Center the '''Institute of Aerospace Medicine''' is the only research institution that primarily deals with life science problems concerning space flight, aviation and traffic.


==Research activities==

The Institute's research activities are focussed on the central task of providing for the health and performance of the persons involved (pilot, crew, passenger, astronaut, motorist, resident etc.)
Furthermore, from a medical point of view the development of countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of [[weightlessness]], like the loss of bone and muscle mass, is one of our main tasks to enable long-term stays of humans in space. At the same time, when conducting research under microgravity conditions, basic functions of the human body are examined by eliminating the interfering influence of gravity in a system-physiological approach. In the field of psychology, the selection of qualified personnel (pilots, astronauts, air traffic controllers) and the development of suitable scientific instruments for the selection procedure are another main task of the Institute. Finally, we also deal with the problem of adaptation of life to extreme environments and take part in projects that are concerned with the search for life in space.

==Core tasks and working groups==

===Medical Operations===

Medical Operations is an interdisciplinary field covering aviation, space and travel medicine. Work carried out here includes the study of the physical, physiological, psychological, ergonomic and medical characteristics of air and space travel. The department is also responsible for the health and well-being of flight personnel and passengers and regularly carries out medical examinations on those groups.

===Biomedical Science Support Center===

This division integrates all activities in ME that provide support for ME internal as well as for external scientists in the field of gravity-relevant applications in the biomedical sciences. The profile reaches from scientific and administrational support when planning experiments in [[microgravity]] over concrete experiment preparation and operational support for accepted flight experiments and corresponding ground experiments up to data management. This expertise is also applied in projects of related fields like [[telemedicine]] and ground systems for satellite communications.

===Flight Physiology===

The research activities of the flight physiology division focus on "workload of aviation personnel", "effects of aircraft noise on humans" and within the field of "performance and environment" on basic and special questions about effects of external stressors on humans (e.g. jet-lag, sleep-deprivation, decompression problems in space).

===Aviation and Space Psychology===

The Institute's Department of Aviation and Space Psychology is located in Hamburg and is largely responsible for personnel selection and certain areas of behavioural training for operation staff (pilots, air traffic controllers and astronauts). In April 2002 the Departments' Quality management system was ISO 9001 certified. As the first Q-System worldwide, this certificate covers all stages of psychological diagnostics.

===Radiation Biology===

The Radio Biology Department is concerned with aviation and space relevant questions regarding the effects of radiation on humans and the biosphere. These include, amongst radiation health and protection issues for astronauts and aircraft crews, monitoring the biological consequences of environmental radiation and genotoxic conditions by biological [[dosimetry]] and [[biosensor]]s and [[bioassays]], the assessment of habitability of other planets with special consideration of possible Mars mission scenarios.

===Space Physiology===

The research of space physiology focusses on the influence of weightlessness, nutrition, physical inactivity, unloading, and aging processes on human health. The investigations are performed in an integrative approach - from the cell to the whole organism - on ground and in space.

===Transport Safety===

The working group Transport Safety uses competences and technological innovations from aviation and space research to develop new solutions for problems of road and rail transport.

The '''Institute of Socio-Political Research''' under the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]  (ISPR RAS) – is a leading Russian academic research center. It is engaged in a fundamental and applied research of social and socio-political processes.

It was established in 1991 in [[Moscow]].

The basic areas and directions of the scientific researches involve: global problems of contemporary civilization and [[Russia]]; analysis and forecasting of Russia’s socio-political development; social dynamics, structure and stratification of Russian society; methods and instruments for sociological research; sociology of management; [[political]] and [[economic sociology]]; demographic and migratory processes; sociology of federate and interethnic relations; social problems of [[national security]]; sociology of [[human rights]]; sociology of youth; [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], etc.

The Institute makes a socio-political analysis of the decisions made by the governmental, legislative and executive bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">In [[toxicology]], the '''median toxic dose''' ('''TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''') of a drug or toxin is the dose at which [[toxicity]] occurs in 50% of cases. The ''type'' of toxicity should be specified for this value to have meaning for practical purposes. The '''median toxic dose''' encompasses the category of toxicity that is greater than [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|half maximum effective concentration]] ('''ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''') but less than the median lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;). However, for some highly potent toxins (ex. [[lofentanil]], [[botulinum toxin]]) the difference between the ED50 and TD50 is so minute that the values assigned to them may be approximated to equal doses. Since toxicity need not be lethal, the TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is generally lower than the [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;), and the latter can be considered an [[upper bound]] for the former. However, since the toxicity is above the effective limit, the TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is generally greater than the ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. If the result of a study is a toxic effect that does not result in death, it is classified as this form of toxicity.&lt;ref name=penningroth&gt;{{cite book|last=Penningroth|first=Stephen|title=Essentials of Toxic Chemical Risk Science and Society|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toxic effects can be defined differently, sometimes considering the therapeutic effect of a substance to be toxic (such as with [[chemotherapeutics]]) which can lead to confusion and contention regarding a substance's TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of these toxic endpoints include cancer, blindness, anemia, birth defects, etc.&lt;ref name="penningroth"/&gt;

'''Merovingian art''' is the art of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the 5th century to the 8th century in present-day [[France]], [[Benelux]] and a part of [[Germany]].
The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] in the 5th century led to important changes in the field of arts.  Sculpture regressed to be little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]] and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, [[goldsmith|gold work]] and the new medium of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] integrated "barbarian" [[Migration Period art|animal-style]] decoration, with [[Late Antique]] motifs, and other contributions from as far as Syria or Ireland to constitute  Merovingian art.

==Architecture==
The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465 &amp;ndash; 511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church.  Plans often continued the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]] tradition, but also took influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia.  In the East, most structures were in timber, but stone was more common for significant buildings in the West and in the southern areas that later fell under Merovingian rule.  Most major churches have been rebuilt, usually more than once, but many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology.  The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460-490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A feature of the basilica of Saint-Martin that became a hallmark of Frankish church architecture was the sarcophagus or reliquary of the saint raised to be visible and sited axially behind the altar, sometimes in the [[apse]].  There are no Roman precedents for this Frankish innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Jacobsen, "Saints' Tombs in Frankish Church Architecture" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:1107-1143).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Peter's church, Vienne (Isère)|Saint Peter's church]] in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] is the only surviving one. A number of other buildings, now lost, including the Merovingian foundations of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St. Gereon]] in [[Cologne]], and the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris, are described as similarly ornate.

Some small buildings remain, especially [[Baptistery|baptistries]], which fell out of fashion and were spared rebuilding.  In [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Riez]] and [[Fréjus]], three octagonal [[baptistery|baptistries]], each covered with a cupola on pillars, are testimony to the influence of oriental architecture (the baptistry of Riez, in the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], recalls that of St.&amp;nbsp;George, Ezra', [[Syria]]). Very different from these Provençal baptistries, except for the quatrefoil one of [[Venasque]], that of [[Baptistère Saint-Jean|St.&amp;nbsp;Jean]] at [[Poitiers]] (6th century) has the form of a rectangle flanked by three apses. The original building has probably undergone a number of alterations but preserves in its decoration (marble capitals) a Merovingian character.

Among the very many [[crypt]]s, numerous due to the importance of the cult of saints at the time, only those of St.&amp;nbsp;Seurin, Bordeaux, [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|St.&amp;nbsp;Laurent, Grenoble]], and the abbey of [[Jouarre Abbey|Jouarre]] (7th century) survive.

==Other arts==
[[File:Sacr Gelasianum 131v 132.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gelasian Sacramentary|Sacramentarium Gelasianum]]. Frontispice and Incipit from the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] manuscript]]
By the 7th century, the abilities of Merovingian craftsmen must have been well regarded, as they were brought to England to re-introduce glass making skills, and Merovingian stonemasons were used to build English churches.&lt;ref name="bede"&gt;Bede. ''The Lives of the Holy Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow''.&lt;/ref&gt; Merovingian masons also employed the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' extensively and are responsible for bringing it to England and bequeathing it to the [[Normans]], who brought it to Italy.

Very few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts survive, of which the most richly decorated is the 8th century [[Gelasian Sacramentary]] in the [[Vatican Library]], which has geometric and animal decoration, less complex than that of the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, but like it derived from metalwork motifs, with some influence from Late Antiquity and the Near-East. The principal centres were the [[Abbey of Luxeuil]], an [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish]] foundation, and later its daughter house at [[Corbie Abbey]].

A large Merovingian art collection in Berlin was taken by Soviet Occupiers to Russia, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Effros|first1=Bonnie|title=Uncovering the Germanic Past: Merovingian Archaeology in France, 1830-1914|date=14 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696710|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Germany Worried About Losing Out in Looted Art Row {{!}} Culture {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 16.08.2007|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-worried-about-losing-out-in-looted-art-row/a-2738594|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=DW.COM|agency=DW|date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Russia displays looted German treasure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/13/russia.secondworldwar|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4655">[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|210px|thumb|Delegates of the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. Before this meeting, only a de facto metaconstitution existed.]]
A '''metaconstitution''' is a set of pre-constitutional rules.&lt;ref&gt;These rules are often referred to as "metarules". The metarules are developed from axioms appropriate to the time period. Thus, what is actually constructed can be variable.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in lieu of a formalized [[constitution]] and consists of accepted axiomatic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Alexander |first= Larry|title=  Constitutionalism:Philosophical Foundations| pages= 2–3| isbn=0-521-79999-6| publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is similar to or developed from this. A metaconstitution is also less binding, and can be used to a less rigid form of government. To many nations, the metaconstitution provides an "exit-option", where they may variate from the written document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaken |first= Anne Van|author2=Christian List |author3=Christoph Lutege |title=Deliberation and Decision|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn=0-7546-2358-0| page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metaconstitution, unlike formal constitutions, never needs to be written. Its creation results from the morality and judgment of the people. To be formulated, the people must be generally opposed to anarchy and must desire some form of governing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=O'Mahony|first=Paul|title= Criminal Justice in Ireland| publisher=Institute of Public Administration| isbn=1-902448-71-5| page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although vague in concept, the metaconstitution almost always creates the basic roles of leader v. follower. The purpose of the document, however, prevents the placement of total power on the leader. The populace is trusted to self-govern except in severe cases. Such theory does not differ much from [[salutary neglect]] or [[laissez faire]].

==Historical concept==
Many prominent political philosophers have discoursed on the subject of metaconstitutionalism, though not directly. Some address the topic as a looser constitution in which the government's singular duty is to protect the people and vice versa. Per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: {{cquote|If it be admitted that a man possessing absolute power may misuse that power . . . . why should not a majority be liable to the same reproach? Men do not change their characters by uniting with each other. . . . For myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow, I care but little to know who oppresses me; and I am not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke because it is held out to me by the arms of a million of men.|25px|25px|Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), Democracy in America, New York: New American Library, 1956, pp. 114, 149}}

The concept of metaconstitutionalism received light during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], as a possible replacement to the [[Articles of Confederation]]. Per the Federalist, Number 51: {{cquote|In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself . A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.|25px|25px|Federalist, Number 51}}

==Metaconstitutions==

{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}

==Criticisms==
A metaconstitution is constructed to provide a looser equivalent for government. However, a metaconstitutionalistic society is more likely to suffer from domestic disorder.&lt;ref name= "disorder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kromkowski|first=Charles Aloysius|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80848-0|page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the government cannot wield any power to control the outbreak. Lack of trade and corruption are also major difficulties for a metaconstitution. Again, the governments legal inability to enforce powerful law prevents it from containing situations.&lt;ref name= "disorder" /&gt; In this usage of "metaconstitution", it can also mean a constitution with a nearly non-existent [[executive branch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7611">The '''National Association of Teachers of Singing''' ('''NATS''') is a professional organization for [[Voice teacher|singing teachers]], and it is the largest association of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;NATS web site&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 6,500 members,&lt;ref&gt;NATS web site&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from the [[United States]].  Additional members are from [[Canada]] and over twenty-five other countries around the world including: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siri navigates her way to Hobart|url = http://at.perthnow.com.au/link/c307140d4d63a0fc9a4208adde57fbba?domain=perthnow.com.au|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Driven by its mission statement and Code of Ethics, NATS offers a variety of lifelong learning experiences to its members, such as workshops, intern programs, master classes, and conferences, all beginning at the local chapter level and progressing to state, regional, and national events.

NATS also supports the growth and enrichment of its members through the publication of the [[Journal of Singing]], a scholarly journal with articles on all aspects of singing and the teaching of singing, written by distinguished scholars in their fields.  Originally titled the ''NATS Bulletin'', it has been published since the formation of the organization in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
NATS was founded in 1944 in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an outgrowth of the development of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] (MTNA) in the early years of the twentieth century, a group of singing teachers incorporated the association in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] on November 27, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The first annual meeting of the new organization was held on January 7, 1908 at [[Steinway Hall]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917 it changed its name to the [[New York Singing Teachers' Association]] (NYSTA).&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 the [[Los Angeles]] Guild of Teachers of Singing was chartered, and two years later it published a Code of Ethics that was later embraced by the national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Chicago]] Council of Teachers of Singing was organized in 1930.

These local organizations began the process of becoming a national organization in the early 1940s.  During the 1944 MTNA Convention, members of the various groups met on Thursday, March 23, 1944, at the Netherland Plaza Hotel in [[Cincinnati]] to create the National Association of Teachers of Singing.&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent historical highlights are given on the organization's web site.&lt;ref&gt;Section "Who is NATS?" www.nats.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The association has a national office in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and is governed by a national Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;Names of current board members is listed on the NATS web site, www.nats.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Members belong to one of 14 national Regions, depending upon which state they reside in:
* Cal-Western Region
* Central Region
* Eastern Region
* Great Lakes Region
* Intermountain Region
* Mid-Atlantic Region
* Mid-South Region
* New England Region
* North Central Region
* Northwestern Region
* Southeastern Region
* Southern Region
* Texoma Region
* West Central Region
A Regional Governor serves as the head of each national region.  Individual states and localities also have independent chapters, with State Governors and chapter presidents leading them.

Members are invited to attend a National Conference (convention) every two years, sponsored by a different city and Region each time.  Recent conventions include:
* 2016, [[Chicago, Illinois]]
* 2014, [[Boston, Massachusetts]]
* 2012, [[Orlando, Florida]]
* 2010, [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]
* 2008, [[Nashville, Tennessee]]
* 2006, [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]
* 2004, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]
* 2002, [[San Diego, California]]
The 2018 National Conference will be held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

The National organization also provides several National Workshops each year for [[voice teacher|teachers]] to learn new ideas and teaching strategies&lt;ref&gt;Current National workshops are listed at http://www.nats.org/programs/national-workshops.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many Regional, state, and chapter meetings held at regular times throughout the year.  These are usually a workshop on a specific topic or a variety of topics, and some include masterclasses and student auditions/competitions.

==Mission statement==
"To encourage the highest standards of the vocal art and of ethical principles in the teaching of singing; and to promote vocal education and research at all levels, both for the enrichment of the general public and for the professional advancement of the talented."

==Code of Ethics==
NATS members are charged with honoring a national Code of Ethics.  This list of proper behaviors for voice teachers was established to encourage honesty and professional standards.  The current Code, written in 2006, is divided into three sections:&lt;ref&gt;The complete text is given at: http://www.nats.org/who-is-nats/code-of-ethics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* I. Personal Ethical Standards
* II. Ethical Standards Relating to Students
* III. Ethical Standards Relating to Colleagues

==Competition==

Students of NATS members have access to one of the organization's most widely recognized activities: Student Auditions. They also have the opportunity, along with members, to compete at a national level through the National Association of Teachers of Singing Artist Awards (NATSAA). The national Artist Award program began in 1955 as the Singer of the Year Scholarship Auditions.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

The NATSAA competition is designed to assist singers prepared to launch a professional career, and to that end substantial monetary and performance prizes are offered. The competition takes place every other year, in conjunction with NATS Conferences. Preliminary competitions are held regionally, and semifinals/finals take place at the NATS Conference. 
Throughout its history the purpose of this [NATSAA] competition has been to select, through a series of elimination rounds on the district, regional, and national levels, singers whose artistry indicates that they are ready for a professional career and to encourage them toward that goal with a cash prize and the opportunity for performance engagements.

'''National Center for Disease Control and Public Health''' ({{lang-ka|დაავადებათა კონტროლისა და საზოგადოებრივი ჯანმრთელობის ეროვნული ცენტრი}}) is a national agency of the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], under the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Affairs (Georgia)|Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs]]. It is based in the capital [[Tbilisi]]. The NCDC is tasked with protecting the public's health against dangerous outbreaks of disease. Its headquarters lie on Asatiani Street in the Saburtalo district of the city, and the agency employs 440 people, 65% of whom have university degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.ge/pages/p_100_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCDC's is assisted by a number of regional health stations around the country, which also conduct immunization and detection.

The responsibilities the NCDC is not only to carry out surveillance of communicable and [[non-communicable disease]]s, but also to investigate outbreaks of particular interest, one notable case being the outbreak of [[Tularemia]] in 2006.

[[Image:Biolab Tbilisi 02.JPG|thumb|right|alt=National Public Health Reference Laboratory, in Tbilisi, Georgia.]]

The NCDC also has responsibility for securing an extensive repository of live pathogens, which have been accumulated over the last century. This national reference laboratory used to be located in the top floor of the main building on Asatiani St, but was moved to a newly built facility in Alexeyevka, a suburb to Tbilisi a few kilometers from the [[Tbilisi International Airport]]. This Central Public Health Reference Laboratory was formally opened on 18 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23257&lt;/ref&gt;

The new facility is a joint Georgia-USA project which complements existing facilities in Bangkok, Thailand and Nairobi, Kenya. It is part of Georgia's efforts to ensure biosecurity and biosafety.

[[Image:NEARI Sm Logo.jpg|frame|NEARI Logo]]
The '''New England Adolescent Research Institute''' (NEARI) is a [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] [[education]]al organization operating in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]].  It was founded in 1984 by [[Steven Bengis]] and [[Penny Cuninggim]] to treat extremely challenged youth with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], [[mental illness]], and/or [[neurological disorder]]s.  NEARI operates Chapter 766 [[special education]] day [[school]]s for [[high school]], [[middle school]], and older [[elementary school]] students.  Additionally, NEARI operates a training institute and a publishing company

The publishing company has published works ranging from manuals for specialists in the field of [[sexual assault]] to survivor stories. All works are selected for publication based on their ability to educate the public.

== Educational philosophy ==
The NEARI day schools practice a "relationship-based" model of learning.  This model is a set of policies and principles that guide staff to form lasting relationships with their students.  Most of the details of this model are proprietary and can not be disclosed here.  One publicly acknowledged piece of this model is a low [[student]]-to-staff ratio.  NEARI operates on a ratio of about 3:1 or 2:1, depending on the program in question.  The drawback to this approach is the substantial [[finance|financial]] load it places on the organization.

== Brain-based treatment and education ==
Since the year 2000, NEARI has been incorporating "brain-based" technology into its educational and therapeutic services.  Coordinated by [[Penny Cuninggim]], this initiative combines specialized [[physical exercise|exercise]] with an awareness of [[learning styles]] and new practices for diagnosing and treating [[visual system|visual]] and [[Auditory system|auditory]] processing issues.

== Facilities ==

=== Current facilities ===
The NEARI day schools currently operate out of two [[building]]s [[lease]]d from the Immaculate Conception [[parish]], which used to operate a [[parochial school]] out of the buildings.  The structures total about {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}}, but the antiquated [[floor plan]] results in a significant amount of wasted space.  The buildings have a [[computer]]-to-[[student]] ratio of 1:2 or better in all classrooms, all of which are [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[iMac]]s or newer.  The structures' [[electrical]] system is outdated, however, which results in frequent tripping of [[circuit breakers]].  The school buildings do not have commercial [[kitchen]] facilities, so student [[meal]]s are delivered daily by the Holyoke School Department.  The facilities also suffer from poor insulation and aging [[HVAC]] systems, causing higher energy costs.

=== Future facilities ===
NEARI is in the process of constructing a new, [[state-of-the-art]] [[school]], [[clinic]], and training facility on Old Easthampton Road, near Route 141 in northern Holyoke.  This facility is being planned as an [[natural environment|environmentally]]-safe, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] [[green building]].  This new structure is supposed to correct the wasted-space issue as well as providing modern [[kitchen]], [[HVAC]], and [[vocational]] services.  The project is working closely with regulators to avoid harming any [[endangered species]] native to the [[Holyoke Range]], such as the [[Marbled Salamander]].  The total cost of this project is currently estimated at over six million [[american dollar|dollars]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3100">'''OLGA''' is a modelling tool for [[transportation]] of [[Petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] and [[water]] in the same [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], so-called [[Multiphase flow|multiphase]] transportation. The name is short for "oil and gas simulator". The main challenge with multiphase fluid flow is the formation of slugs (plugs of oil and water) in the pipelines, which causes large problems at the receiving end at the platform or the onshore plant. The modelling tool makes it possible to calculate the fluid flow and safely bring the flow to the receiving destination on shore, on a platform or a production ship through the pipes.

==History==

The idea for the tool was conceived in 1979 by two researchers at [[Institute for Energy Technology|IFE]], Norway: Dag Malnes and Kjell Bendiksen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ife.no/departments/process_and_fluid_flow_tech/historienomolga/view?searchterm=olga&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of OLGA was financed by [[Statoil]] and was ready in 1980. The tool was developed further by IFE in collaboration with [[SINTEF]] in the 1980s.

January 1, 1984 a joint industry agreement was signed by Statoil, IFE and SINTEF on the continued development of OLGA. IFE had the main responsibility for developing the model, while the technical experiments were performed in SINTEF’s laboratory at Tiller.

Until 2012 the SPT Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sptgroup.com/&lt;/ref&gt; owned the rights to OLGA. In March of 2012, Schlumberger announced an agreement with Altor Fund II for the acquisition of SPT Group.  The acquisition was completed in Q2.  SPT Group, founded in 1971, was headquartered in Norway employing approximately 280 people in 11 countries at the time of the acquisition.  The tool has been under continuous and still ongoing development, among others in the HORIZON II project where IFE and SPT Group are partners. OLGA has a global market share of about 90%. The technology is regarded as a central success for Norwegian petroleum research.

OLGA has enabled the development of oil and gas fields at deeper seas and farther from shore than would otherwise be possible without this technology, for example the fields Troll, Ormen Lange and Snøhvit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sintef.no/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&amp;page_id=2822&amp;query=olga&amp;hiword=OLGAS%20olga%20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iris pseudoacorus flowering.jpg|thumb|A flowering water-purifying plant (''Iris pseudacorus'')]]

Most '''organisms involved in [[water purification]]''' originate from the waste, [[wastewater]] or water stream itself or arrive as resting spore of some form from the atmosphere. In a very few cases, mostly associated with [[constructed wetlands]], specific organisms are planted to maximise the efficiency of the process.

==Role of biota==
[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] are an essential component of most [[sewage treatment]] processes and many [[water purification]] systems. Most of the organisms involved are derived from the waste, [[wastewater]] or water stream itself or from the atmosphere or soil water. However some  processes, especially those involved in removing very low concentrations of contaminants, may use engineered eco-systems created by the introduction of specific plants and sometimes animals.  Some full scale sewage treatment plants also use [[constructed wetlands]] to provide treatment

==Pollutants in wastewater==

===Pathogens===
[[Parasite]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es may be injurious to the health of people or livestock ingesting the [[Water pollution|polluted water]].  These pathogens may have originated from [[sewage]] or from domestic or wild bird or mammal [[feces]].  Pathogens may be killed by ingestion by larger organisms, oxidation, infection by [[phage]]s or irradiation by [[ultraviolet]] sunlight unless that sunlight is blocked by plants or suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun pp.31-3&amp;31-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspended solids===
Particles of soil or organic matter may be suspended in the water.  Such materials may give the water a cloudy or [[turbidity|turbid]] appearance.  The anoxic decomposition of some organic materials may give rise to obnoxious or unpleasant smells as sulphur containing compounds are released.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer pp.29&amp;35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
Compounds containing [[nitrogen]], [[potassium]] or [[phosphorus]] may encourage growth of aquatic plants and thus increase the available energy in the local food-web. this can lead to increased concentrations of suspended organic material. In some cases specific micro-nutrients may be required to allow the available nutrients to be fully utilised by living organisms. In other cases, the presence of specific chemical species may produce toxic effects limiting growth and abundance of living matter.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy pp.256-258&amp;492&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals===
Many dissolved or suspended metal salts exert harmful effects in the environment sometimes at very low concentrations. Some aquatic plants are able to remove very low metal concentrations, with the metals ending up bound to clay or other mineral particles.

==Organisms==
[[Saprophytic]] bacteria and [[fungi]] can convert organic matter into living cell mass, carbon dioxide, water and a range of metabolic by-products.  These saprophytic organisms may then be predated upon by [[protozoa]], [[rotifers]] and, in cleaner waters, [[Bryozoa]] which consume suspended organic particles including viruses and pathogenic bacteria.  Clarity of the water may begin to improve as the [[protozoa]] are subsequently consumed by [[rotifer]]s and [[cladocera]].&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy pp.380&amp;381&lt;/ref&gt;  Purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers must either be mixed throughout the water or have the water circulated past them to be effective.  Sewage treatment plants mix these organisms as [[activated sludge]] or circulate water past organisms living on [[trickling filter]]s or [[rotating biological contactor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun pp.32-12,32-31&amp;34-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic vegetation may provide similar surface habitat for purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers in a pond or marsh setting; although water circulation is often less effective.  Plants and algae have the additional advantage of removing nutrients from the water; but some of those nutrients will be returned to the water when the plants die unless the plants are removed from the water.  Because of the complex chemistry of [[Phosphorus]] much of this element is in an unavailable form unless decomposition creates anoxic conditions which render the phosphorus available for re-uptake. Plants also provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]], a refuge for [[fish]], and [[oxygen]] for [[aerobic bacteria]]. In addition, [[fish]] can limit [[Pest (organism)|pests]] such as [[mosquitoes]].  Fish and waterfowl feces return waste to the water, and their feeding habits may increase [[turbidity]].  [[Cyanobacteria]] have the disadvantageous ability to [[nitrogen fixation|add nutrients from the air]] to the water being purified and to generate toxins in some cases.

The choice of [[organism]] depends on the local [[climate]] different [[species]] and other factors. Indigenous species usually tend to be better adapted to the local environment.

===Macrophytes===
[[Image:Irispseudacorus waterpurification.jpg|thumb|right|A water-purifying plant (''Iris pseudacorus'') in growth after winter (leaves die at that time of year)]]
The choice of plants in engineered wet-lands or managed lagoons is dependent on the purification requirements of the system and this may involve plantings of varying plant species at a range of depths to achieve the  required goal.

Plants purify water by consuming excess [[nutrients]] and by providing surfaces upon which a wide range of other purifying organisms can live. They also are effective oxygenators in sunlight. They also have the ability to translocate chemicals between their submerged foliage and their root systems and this is of significance in engineered wet-lands designed to de-toxify waste waters. Plants that have been used in temperate climates include ''[[Nymphaea|Nymphea alba]]'',''[[Phragmites australis]]'', ''[[Sparganium|Sparganium erectum]]'', ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'', ''[[Schoenoplectus|Schoenoplectus lacustris]]'' and ''[[Carex acutiformis]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Where oxygenation is a critical requirement  ''[[Stratiotes|Stratiotes aloides]]'',  ''[[Hydrocharis|Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'', ''[[Acorus calamus]]'', ''[[Myriophyllum]]'' species and ''[[Elodea]]'' have been used.
''[[Hydrocharis|Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'' and ''[[Nuphar |Nuphar lutea]]'' have been used where shade and cover are required

===Fish===
Fish are frequently the top level predators in a managed treatment eco-system and in some case may simply be a mono-culture of herbivorous species. Management of multi-species fisheries requires careful management and may involve a range of fish species including bottom-feeders and predatory species to limit population growth of the herbivorous fish

===Rotifers===
[[Rotifer]]s are microscopic complex organisms and are filter feeders removing fine particulate matter from water. They occur naturally in aerobic lagoons, activated sludge processes, in trickling filters and in final settlement tanks and are a significant factor in removing suspended bacterial cells and algae from the water column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23552245|title=The use of rotifers for limiting filamentous bacteria Type 021N a bacteria causing activated sludge bulking.| doi=10.2166/wst.2013.028|volume=67|year=2013|journal=Water Sci Technol|pages=1557–63|author=Kocerba-Soroka W, Fiałkowska E, Pajdak-Stós A, Klimek B, Kowalska E, Drzewicki A, Salvadó H, Fyda J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projektor.uj.edu.pl/en/sp/naturescope/rotifers|title=Rotifers – the allies from the invisible world|publisher=Projektor Jagielloński|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annelids===
[[Annelid]] worms are essential to the effective operation of trickling filters &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=
Earthworms and Trickling Filters|publisher= Water Environment Federation|jstor=25042220|author1=Hartenstein R|author2=Kaplan D L|author3= Neuhauser E F |volume=56, No. 3, Part I|date = March 1984|pages= 294–298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to remove excess bio-mass and enhancing natural sloughing of the bio-film. Supernumerary worms are very commonly found in the drainage troughs around trickling filters and in the final settlement sludge. Annelids also play a key role in lagoon treatment systems and in the effective working or engineered wet-lands. In this environment worms are a principal force in mixing in the upper few centimetres of the sediment layer exposing organic material to both oxidative and anoxic environments aiding the complete breakdown of most organics. They are also a key ingredient in the food-chain transferring energy upwards to fish and aquatic birds.

===Protozoa===
The range of protozoan species found is very wide but may include species of the following genera:
* [[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]&lt;ref name="fgo"&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun p.34-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arcella]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Blepharisma]]&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;Hammer pp.54&amp;61&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Didinium]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Euglena]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Hypotrich]]&lt;ref name="ham"/&gt;
* [[Paramecium]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Suctoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy p.381&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stylonychia]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Vorticella]]&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;

===Insects===
* [[Chironomidae]] bloodworm larva&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Podura aquatica]] water springtail&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;
* [[Psychodidae]] drain fly or filter fly larva&lt;ref name="fgo"/&gt;

Any object that symbolically—or, more precisely, iconically—resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus; however, such objects are more often referred to as being '''phallic''' (as in "'''phallic symbol'''"). Such symbols often represent fertility and cultural implications that are associated with the male sexual organ, as well as the [[male orgasm]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|Tintinnabulum]] from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The term is a loanword from [[Latin]] ''phallus'', itself borrowed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φαλλός}}, which is ultimately a derivation from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] *''bʰel''- "to inflate, swell". Compare with [[Old Norse]] (and [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]]) ''boli'' "[[bull]]", [[Old English]] ''bulluc'' "[[Cattle|bullock]]", Greek {{lang|grc|φαλλή}} "[[whale]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=penis&amp;searchmode=none etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

The Hohle phallus, a 28,000-year-old siltstone phallus discovered in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave and reassembled in 2005, is among the oldest phallic representations known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Amos

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Bronze ithyphallic figurine with a head of phalluses.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Polyphallic wind chime from [[Pompeii]]; a bell hung from each phallus]]
[[File:0007MAN-Herma.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Herma|Herm]]]]
In traditional [[Greek mythology]], [[Hermes]], god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the ''messenger'' god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on [[herms]] (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god.  [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], son of [[Hermes]], was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus.

[[Priapus]] is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of [[Aphrodite]] and either [[Dionysus]] or [[Adonis]], according to different forms of the original myth, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia.  His name is the origin of the medical term [[priapism]].

The city of [[Tyrnavos]] in Greece holds an annual [[Phallic processions|Phallus festival]], a traditional phallophoric event on the first days of [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html "The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece"], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, Retrieved on the 15-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus was ubiquitous in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], particularly in the form of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a phallic charm. The ruins of [[Pompeii]] produced bronze wind chimes ''([[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]])'' that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the [[evil eye]] and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to [[Augustine of Hippo]], the cult of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity [[Mutunus Tutunus]] promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] has sometimes been characterized as "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallocentric]]".

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Osiris statuette cropped.jpg|thumb|Egyptian statuette of Osiris with phallus and [[amulet]]s]]
The phallus played a role in the cult of [[Osiris]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, [[Set (mythology)|Set]] scattered them all over Egypt and his wife [[Isis]] retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; see the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]. Isis made him a wooden replacement.

The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god [[Min (god)|Min]] was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis.

''Kuker'' is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]] performed by [[Kukeri]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"&gt;Kernbach, Victor (1989).

In [[Switzerland]], the heraldic bears in a coat of arms had to be painted with bright red [[penis]]es, otherwise they would have been mocked as being she-bears. In 1579, a calendar printed in [[St. Gallen]] omitted the genitals from the heraldic bear of [[Appenzell]], nearly leading to war between the two cantons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Neubecker | first1=Ottfried | title=Heraldry : sources, symbols, and meaning | date=1976 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | isbn=9780070463080 | page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Strehler | first1=Hermann | title=Das Churer Missale von 1589 | journal=Gutenberg-Jahrbuch | date=1965 | volume=40 | page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Grzimek | first1=Bernhard | title=Grzimek's Animal life encyclopedia | date=1972 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. | location=New York | volume=12 | page=119 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UgQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22&amp;dq=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
Figures of [[Kokopelli]] and [[Itzamna]] (as the Mayan tonsured maize god) in [[Pre-Columbian America]] often include phallic content. Additionally, over forty large monolithic sculptures (''Xkeptunich'') have been documented from Terminal Classic Maya sites with the majority of examples occurring in the Puuc region of Yucatán (Amrhein 2001). Uxmal has the largest collection with eleven sculptures now housed under a protective roof on site. The largest sculpture was recorded at Almuchil measuring more than 320&amp;nbsp;cm high with a diameter at the base of the shaft measuring 44&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Amrhein, Laura Marie (2001). An Iconographic and Historic Analysis of Terminal Classic Maya Phallic Imagery. Unpublished PhD dissertation, Richmond: [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative sects===

[[St. Priapus Church]] (French: ''Église S. Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.

==Psychoanalysis==
[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]
The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire. 

In ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.

==Modern use of the phallus==
The phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is "[[Princess X]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W. W. Norton and Co, New York (2008)}} page 66f, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phenakistoscope 3g07690b.gif|thumb|Rhythm, a sequence in time repeated, featured in dance: an [[Phenakistoscope|early moving picture]] demonstrates the [[waltz]].]]

'''Rhythm''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ῥυθμός}}, ''rhythmos'', "any regular [[repetition (music)|recurring]] motion, [[symmetry#Symmetry in music|symmetry]]" {{harv|Liddell and Scott|1996}}) generally means a "[[motion (physics)|movement]] marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions" {{harv|Anon.|1971|loc=2537}}. This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a [[Frequency|periodicity]] or [[frequency]] of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the [[riff]] in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.

In the [[performance arts]], rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of [[music|musical sounds and silences]] that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken [[language]] and poetry. In some performing arts, such as [[hip hop music]], the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as "timed movement through space" {{harv|Jirousek|1995}} and a common language of [[pattern]] unites rhythm with geometry. In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. Recent work in these areas includes books by [[Maury Yeston|Maury]] {{harvtxt|Yeston|1976}}, [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]] {{harv|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1983}}, [[Jonathan Kramer]], Christopher {{harvtxt|Hasty|1997}}, [[Godfried Toussaint|Godfried]] {{harvtxt|Toussaint|2005}}, William {{harvtxt|Rothstein|1989}}, Joel Lester {{harv|Lester|1986}}, and [[Guerino Mazzola]].

==Anthropology==
[[File:Traditional indonesian instruments02.jpg|thumb|300px|Percussion instruments have clearly defined sounds that aid the creation and perception of complex rhythms]]

In his television series ''How Music Works'', [[Howard Goodall]] presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat {{harv|Goodall|2006|loc=0:03:10}}. Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is "reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots" {{harv|Patel|2014|loc=1}}. Justin London writes that musical metre "involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time" {{harv|London|2004|loc=4}}. The "perception" and "abstraction" of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into "tick-tock-tick-tock" ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977c}}).

[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|thumb|A simple [quadr][[duple meter|duple]] [[drum pattern]], which lays a foundation of duration common in popular music: {{Audio|Simple duple drum pattern.mid|Play}}.]]

[[Joseph Jordania]] recently suggested that the sense of rhythm was developed in the early stages of [[hominid]] evolution by the forces of [[natural selection]] {{harv|Jordania|2011|pg.99-101}}. Plenty of animals walk rhythmically and hear the sounds of the heartbeat in the womb, but only humans have the ability to be engaged ([[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrained]]) in rhythmically coordinated vocalizations and other activities. According to Jordania, development of the sense of rhythm was central for the achievement of the specific neurological state of the [[battle trance]], crucial for the development of the effective [[defense (military)|defense]] system of early hominids. Rhythmic [[Battle cry|war cry]], rhythmic drumming by [[shaman]]s, rhythmic [[drilling]] of the soldiers and contemporary professional combat forces listening to the heavy rhythmic rock music {{harv|Pieslak|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2016}}}} all use the ability of rhythm to unite human individuals into a shared [[collective identity]] where group members put the interests of the group above their individual interests and safety.

Some types of parrots can know rhythm {{harv|Anon.|2009}}. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] states that [[chimpanzee]]s and other animals show no similar appreciation of rhythm yet posits that human affinity for rhythm is fundamental, so that a person's sense of rhythm cannot be lost (e.g. by stroke). "There is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap, peck, or move in synchrony with an auditory beat" ({{harvnb|Patel|2006}}, cited in {{harvnb|Sacks|2007|loc=239–40}}, who adds, "No doubt many pet lovers will dispute this notion, and indeed many animals, from the Lippizaner horses of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna to performing circus animals appear to 'dance' to music. It is not clear whether they are doing so or are responding to subtle visual or tactile cues from the humans around them.") Human rhythmic arts are possibly to some extent rooted in courtship ritual {{harv|Mithen|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}}.

[[File:Compound triple drum pattern.png|thumb|right|Compound triple drum pattern: divides three beats into three. {{Audio|Compound triple drum pattern.mid|Play}} Contains repetition on three levels.]]

The establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and, as a subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels, a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct. For this reason, the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm. Musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered [[polyrhythm]] and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature, called [[polymeter]]. Such are the [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan African music|cross-rhythms of Sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Kotekan|interlocking ''kotekan'']] rhythms of the ''[[gamelan]]''.

For information on rhythm in [[Music of India|Indian music]] see [[Tala (music)]]. For other Asian approaches to rhythm see [[Rhythm in Persian music]], [[Rhythm in Arabian music]] and [[Usul (music)|''Usul''—Rhythm in Turkish music]] and [[Dumbek rhythms]].

==Terminology==

===Pulse, beat and measure===

''(See main articles; [[Pulse (music)]], [[Beat (music)]])''
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Most music, dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying "metric level", a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied, the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or ''tactus'' of the [[mensural level]] ({{harvnb|Berry|1987|loc=349}}; {{harvnb|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1983}}; {{harvnb|Fitch and Rosenfeld|2007|loc=44}}), or ''beat level'', sometimes simply called the [[beat (music)|beat]]. This consists of a (repeating) series of identical yet distinct [[Frequency|periodic]] short-duration [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] perceived as points in time {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=213}}. The "beat" pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental: it has a [[tempo]] to which listeners [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrain]] as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music {{harv|Handel|1989}}. It is currently most often designated as a crotchet or [[quarter note]] in western notation (see [[time signature]]). Faster levels are ''division levels'', and slower levels are ''multiple levels'' {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=213}}. [[Maury Yeston]] clarified "Rhythms of recurrence" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups {{harv|Yeston|1976|loc=50–52}}. "Once a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present" {{harv|Lester|1986|loc=77}}.

===Unit and gesture===
[[File:Rhythmic units.png|thumb|Rhythmic units: division level shown above and rhythmic units shown below {{audio|Rhythmic units.mid|Play}}.]]

A [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]] that synchronises with a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or pulses on the underlying [[metric level]] may be called a ''rhythmic unit''. These may be classified as; ''metric''—even patterns, such as steady [[eighth note]]s or [[pulse (music)|pulses]]—''intrametric''—confirming patterns, such as [[dotted note|dotted]] [[eighth note|eighth]]-[[sixteenth note]] and [[swung note|swing]] patterns—''contrametric''—non-confirming, or [[syncopated]] patterns and ''extrametric''—irregular patterns, such as [[tuplet]]s.

A rhythmic gesture is any [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]] that, in contrast to the rhythmic unit, does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or pulses on an underlying [[metric level]]. It may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the [[rhythmic unit]]s it contains. Beginnings on a strong pulse are ''thetic'', a weak pulse, ''anacrustic'' and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called ''initial rest''. Endings on a strong pulse are ''strong'', a weak pulse, ''weak'' and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are ''upbeat'' {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=239}}.

===Alternation and repetition===
Rhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements, the [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of the [[Accent (music)|strong and weak]] beat, the played beat and the inaudible but implied [[rest (music)|rest beat]], the long and short note. As well as perceiving rhythm we must be able to anticipate it. This depends on [[repetition (music)|repetition]] of a pattern that is short enough to memorize.

The alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry, dance and music. The common [[Foot (prosody)|poetic term "foot"]] refers, as in dance, to the [[Arsis and thesis|lifting and tapping]] of the foot in time. In a similar way musicians speak of an [[Beat (music)#Upbeat|upbeat]] and a [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] and of the [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|"on" and "off" beat]]. These contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend on repeating patterns of duration, accent and rest forming a "pulse-group" that corresponds to the [[foot (poetry)|poetic foot]]. Normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and [[counting (music)|counting]] the pulses until the next accent ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}). A rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the downbeat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called [[Syncopation|syncopated]] rhythm.

Normally, even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}) either by [[Additive and divisive rhythm|addition or division]]. According to [[Pierre Boulez]], beat structures beyond four, in western music, are "simply not natural" {{harv|Slatkin|n.d.|loc=at 5:05}}.

===Tempo and duration===
''(See main articles; [[Duration (music)]], [[Tempo]])''

The tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the ''tactus'', a measure of how quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in 'beats per minute' ([[Tempo|bpm]]): 60&amp;nbsp;bpm means a speed of one beat per second, a frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. A [[rhythmic unit]] is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a [[pulse (music)|pulse]] or several pulses {{harv|Winold|1975|loc=237}}. The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.

Musical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales, which Moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}}.
*Supershort: a single cycle of an audible wave, approximately {{frac|1|30}}–{{frac|1|10,000}} second (30–10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz or more than 1,800&amp;nbsp;bpm). These, though rhythmic in nature, are not perceived as separate events but as continuous [[pitch (music)|musical pitch]].
*Short: of the order of one second (1&amp;nbsp;Hz, 60&amp;nbsp;bpm, 10–100,000 audio cycles). Musical tempo is generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute. A continuous pulse cannot be perceived as a musical beat if it is faster than 8–10 per second (8–10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 480–600&amp;nbsp;bpm) or slower than 1 per 1.5–2 seconds (0.6–0.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, 40–30&amp;nbsp;bpm). Too fast a beat becomes a [[drone (music)|drone]], too slow a succession of sounds seems unconnected ({{harvnb|Fraisse|1956}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}; {{harvnb|Woodrow|1951}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}, both quoted in {{harvnb|Covaciu-Pogorilowski|n.d.}}). This time-frame roughly corresponds to the human [[heart rate]] and to the duration of a single step, syllable or [[rhythmic gesture]].
*Medium: ≥ few seconds, This median durational level "defines rhythm in music" {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}} as it allows the definition of a rhythmic unit, the arrangement of an entire sequence of accented, unaccented and silent or "[[rest (music)|rest]]" pulses into the [[cell (music)|cells]] of a ''measure'' that may give rise to the "briefest intelligible and self-existent musical unit" {{harv|Scholes|1977c}}, a ''[[motif (music)|motif]]'' or ''[[figure (music)|figure]]''. This may be further organized, by repetition and variation, into a definite ''phrase'' that may characterise an entire genre of music, dance or poetry and that may be regarded as the fundamental formal unit of music ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).
*Long: ≥ many seconds or a minute, corresponding to a durational unit that "consists of musical phrases" {{harv|Moravcsik|2002|loc=114}}—which may make up a melody, a formal section, a poetic [[stanza]] or a characteristic [[Sequence dance|sequence]] of [[Dance move|dance moves and steps]]. Thus the temporal regularity of musical organisation includes the most elementary levels of [[form (music)|musical form]] {{harv|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}.
*Very long: ≥ minutes or many hours, musical compositions or subdivisions of compositions.

[[Curtis Roads]] {{harv|Roads|2001}} takes a wider view by distinguishing nine-time scales, this time in order of decreasing duration. The first two, the [[Infinity|infinite]] and the supra musical, encompass natural periodicities of months, years, decades, centuries, and greater, while the last three, the [[sample (music)|sample]] and subsample, which take account of digital and electronic rates "too brief to be properly recorded or perceived", measured in millionths of seconds ([[microsecond]]s), and finally the [[infinitesimal]] or infinitely brief, are again in the extra-musical domain. Roads' Macro level, encompassing "overall musical architecture or [[musical form|form]]" roughly corresponds to Moravcsik's "very long" division while his Meso level, the level of "divisions of form" including [[movement (music)|movements]], [[section (music)|sections]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]] taking seconds or minutes, is likewise similar to Moravcsik's "long" category. Roads' [[Sound object]] ({{harvnb|Schaeffer|1959}}; {{harvnb|Schaeffer|1977}}): "a basic unit of musical structure" and a generalization of [[note (music)|note]] (Xenakis' mini structural time scale); fraction of a second to several seconds, and his [[Microsound]] (see [[granular synthesis]]) down to the threshold of audible perception; thousands to millionths of seconds, are similarly comparable to Moravcsik's "short" and "supershort" levels of duration.

===Metric structure===
''(See main articles; [[Metre (music)]], [[Bar (music)]], [[Metre (poetry)]])''

[[File:Claves-detail.gif|thumb|left|300px|Notation of a [[Clave (rhythm)|clave rhythm pattern]]: Each cell of the grid corresponds to a fixed duration of time with a resolution fine enough to capture the timing of the pattern, which may be counted as two bars of four beats in divisive (metrical or symmetrical) rhythm, each beat divided into two cells. The first bar of the pattern may also usefully be counted additively (in measured or [[asymmetrical rhythm]]) as {{serif|'''3 + 3 + 2'''}}.]]

The study of rhythm, stress, and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in [[Speech communication|speech]] is called [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (see also: [[prosody (music)]]): it is a topic in [[linguistics]] and [[poetics]], where it means the number of lines in a [[verse (poetry)|verse]], the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. Music inherited the term "[[Meter (music)|meter or metre]]" from the terminology of poetry ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977b}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977c}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002}}).

The metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or [[Duration (music)|durational patterns]] of the music are projected ({{harvnb|Winold|1975|loc=209-10}}). The terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area {{harv|Scholes|1977b}}. {{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}} preferred to speak of "time" and "rhythmic shape", Imogen Holst {{harv|Holst|1963|loc=17}} of "measured rhythm".

Dance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the [[Tango music|tango]], for example, as to be danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a "slow", so that a full "right–left" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure {{harv|Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|1977|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2014}}}} (''See [[Rhythm and dance]]'').

[[File:clavepattern.svg|thumb|right|300px|Notation of three measures of a clave pattern preceded by one measure of steady quarter notes. This pattern is noted in [[double time]] relative to the one above, in one instead of two four-beat measures {{audio|clave pattern.ogg|Four beats followed by three Clave patterns}}.]]

The general classifications of ''metrical rhythm'', ''measured rhythm'', and ''free rhythm'' may be distinguished {{harv|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}. Metrical or divisive rhythm, by far the most common in Western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat. Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures). Measured rhythm ([[additive rhythm]]) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. Free rhythm is where there is neither {{harv|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}, such as in Christian [[chant]], which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse {{harv|Scholes|1977c}}. ''See [[Free time (music)]]''.

Finally some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as [[Honkyoku]] repertoire for [[shakuhachi]], may be considered ''ametric'' {{harv|Karpinski|2000|loc=19}}. ''Senza misura'' is an Italian musical term for "without meter", meaning to play without a beat, using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar ({{harvnb|Forney and Machlis|2007}}{{Page needed|date=December 2009}}).

==Composite rhythm==&lt;!--[[Composite rhythm]] redirects directly here--&gt;

[[File:Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a composite rhythm.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Inventions and Sinfonias|Sinfonia in F minor]]'' BWV 795, mm. 1-3 {{audio|Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a.mid|Play original}} {{audio|Bach, Sinfonia in F minor BWV 795, mm. 1-3a composite rhythm.mid|Play with composite}}.]]

A ''composite rhythm'' is the [[duration (music)|durations]] and patterns (rhythm) produced by amalgamating all sounding [[part (music)|parts]] of a musical [[texture (music)|texture]]. In music of the [[common practice period]], the composite rhythm usually confirms the [[meter (music)|meter]], often in [[meter (music)|metric]] or even-note patterns identical to the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] on a specific metric level. White defines ''composite rhythm'' as, "the resultant overall rhythmic [[articulation (music)|articulation]] among all the voices of a [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] texture" {{harv|White|1976|loc=136.}}. This concept was concurrently defined as “attack point rhythm” by [[Maury Yeston]] in 1976 as “the extreme rhythmic foreground of a composition – the absolute surface of articulated movement” {{harv|Yeston|1976|loc=41-42}}.

==Rhythm notation==
Worldwide there are many different approaches to passing on rhythmic phrases and patterns, as they exist in traditional music, from generation to generation.

==Educational literature/Advanced training courses==
In the western academic world several schools and training courses have been developed since the 1960s according to national tradition and educational policy. Amongst the few methods and learning programmes for music colleges, universities and conservatoires that are employed on an international scale it is worthy mentioning the following books:
*''Maat en Ritme'', by Horst F. Van Der (1963), published by [https://www.broekmans.com/NL/Bladmuziek/Resultaat [[Broekmans &amp; Van Poppel]]], {{ISBN|9789491906008}}. A collection of graded exercises in two volumes, from elementary to advanced level.
*''Die Kunst des Rhythmus'', by Peter Giger (1993), published by [https://de.schott-music.com/shop/die-kunst-des-rhythmus.html Schott], {{ISBN|978-3-7957-1862-6}}. A theoretical approach to western and non-western rhythms.
*''Rhythm to go'', by [[John Palmer (composer)|John Palmer]] (2013), published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20161229164625/https://visionedition.com/index.php/en/rhythm-to-go Vision Edition] and distributed by [http://composersedition.com/john-palmer-rhythm-to-go CE Books], ISMN 979-0-9002315-1-2. A fast-track collection of graded exercises from elementary to advanced level divided in four sections and including an additional chapter with rhythmic structures used in contemporary music.

===African music===
[[File:Diffa Niger Griot DSC 0177.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A Griot performs at Diffa, Niger, West Africa. The Griot is playing a Ngoni or Xalam.]]
In the [[Griot]] tradition of Africa everything related to music has been passed on orally. [[Babatunde Olatunji]] (1927–2003) developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand-drum, using six vocal sounds, "Goon, Doon, Go, Do, Pa, Ta", for three basic sounds on the drum, each played with either the left or the right hand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for African music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders while African scholars from Kyagambiddwa to Kongo have, for the most part, accepted the conventions and limitations of staff notation, and produced transcriptions to inform and enable discussion and debate {{harv|Agawu|2003|loc=52}}.

John Miller {{harvnb|Chernoff|1979}} has argued that West African music is based on the tension between rhythms, [[polyrhythms]] created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms, generally one dominant rhythm interacting with one or more independent competing rhythms. These often oppose or complement each other and the dominant rhythm. Moral values underpin a musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant [[Cross-beat|cross-rhythmic]] intervals and on [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response form]]. Collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases translated into "drum talk" or in the words of songs. People expect musicians to stimulate participation by reacting to people dancing. Appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values {{harv|Chernoff|1979|}}{{Page needed|date=July 2014}}.

===Indian music===
{{See also|Bol (music)}}
Indian music has also been passed on orally. Tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them. [[Sheila Chandra]], an English pop singer of Indian descent, made performances based on her singing these patterns. In [[Indian Classical music]], the [[Tala (music)|Tala]] of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured.

===Western music===
In the 20th century, composers like [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[Steve Reich]] wrote more rhythmically complex music using [[List of works in unusual time signatures|odd meters]], and techniques such as [[Phasing (music)|phasing]] and [[additive rhythm]]. At the same time, modernists such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat, leading eventually to the widespread use of [[irrational rhythm]]s in [[New Complexity]]. This use may be explained by a comment of [[John Cage]]'s where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually; the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings {{harv|Sandow|2004|loc=257}}. [[LaMonte Young]] also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones ([[drone (music)|drones]]). In the 1930s, [[Henry Cowell]] wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with [[Léon Thérémin]] to invent the [[Rhythmicon]], the first electronic [[Drum machine|rhythm machine]], in order to perform them. Similarly, [[Conlon Nancarrow]] wrote for the [[player piano]].

==Linguistics==
{{Main article|Isochrony}}
In [[linguistics]], rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], along with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed, mora-timed, or stress-timed. Speakers of syllable-timed languages such as Spanish and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] put roughly equal time on each syllable; in contrast, speakers of stressed-timed languages such as English and [[Mandarin Chinese]] put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables, with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing.

{{harvnb|Narmour|1977}} (cited in {{harvnb|Winold|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}) describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive (same duration repeated), cumulative (short-long), or countercumulative (long-short). Cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation, countercumulation with openness or tension, while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive. Richard Middleton points out this method cannot account for [[syncopation]] and suggests the concept of [[Transformation (music)|transformation]] ({{harvnb|Middleton|1990}}, {{Page needed|date=July 2014}}).

==In popular culture==

In day-to-day, figurative language, there are several non-music related uses of the word "rhythm". For example, a person may describe the rhythm of the workday in a certain company or occupation, or the rhythm of life in a certain country or region. In these contexts, the meaning of rhythm is often confused with the concept of "[[Tempo (music)|tempo]]", with people erroneously referring to a certain rhythm as being "slow" or "fast". Speed (tempo) cannot be a specification for a certain rhythm, as the same rhythm can occur at any tempo. A certain tempo compares to other tempi by the difference in speed, whereas a certain rhythm compares to other rhythms by the difference in structure.

'''Robert E. (Bob) Griswold''' (born January 1, 1935, [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is an American author, educator, composer and business leader, and a long-time leader in the field of [[Human Potential Movement|human potential development]]. He is the founder of Effective Learning Systems, Inc. and has authored over one hundred [[self-help]] audio programs. He is best known for his audio series The Love Tapes and While-U-Drive and his book Attract Money and More.[https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=bob+griswold&amp;sprefix=Bob+Gris]

==Biography==
Bob was born in Chicago on January 1, 1935.  He was the third son of parents William &amp; Esther Griswold, both born in Burlington, Iowa.

He attended Smyser Elementary school 1940 - 1948, Steinmetz High School, 1948–1952, Wright Junior College 1952 - 1954, and graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1957.

He married his wife Deirdre in 1963.  They have four children, Kimberly, Kevin, Robert and Jeffrey.

In 1972, he moved his family to Edina Minnesota [[Edina, Minnesota]] where he founded Effective Learning Systems, Inc. [http://effectivelearningsystems.com/] He claims to have personally taught over 50,000 people techniques for relaxation, memory, stress management, controlling habits, goal achievement and self-esteem through seminars conducted for corporations, government agencies, and the general public.[http://www.efflearn.com/success_stories.php]

Griswold has presented many conferences and workshops at the [[University of Minnesota]] and other colleges featuring world-renowned speakers such as [[Norman Cousins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Karl Menninger]], [[O. Carl Simonton]], [[Wayne Dyer]], [[Joyce Brothers]], and others. Many of these prominent professionals have become members of Effective Learning Systems' board of advisors and have contributed a great deal in their knowledge and friendship.[http://www.efflearn.com/about.php/#board]

Griswold's work soon evolved into the most popular series of individual [[self-help book|self-help audios]] in the industry. These have become the top-selling line of self-help audio programs in North American retail bookstores-including over 15 years on the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Bestsellers list, and have reached millions via mail order and the internet. His books and audios are available at [https://www.amazon.com/Robert-E.-Griswold/e/B001HMPMI0 Amazon.com], [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Robert+E.+Griswold&amp;SZE=100&amp;SRT=S Barnes &amp; Noble], [http://www.borders.com/online/store/SearchResults?view=2&amp;rpp=25&amp;type=1&amp;contrib=robert+e+griswold&amp;kids=false&amp;nav=5185&amp;simple=false Borders], and other retailers. Distribution of his books and audios has been primarily within the United States, but his programs are available throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newarrivals.nlb.gov.sg/itemdetail.aspx?bid=12797267 Bob Griswold Audio Programs at Singapore National Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same principles of improving self-esteem, which have been so effective for adults attending his seminars and listening to his tapes and CDs are now available for children on ''Songs for Self-Esteem'' for which he wrote all of the music and lyrics for this album series. He enlisted the assistance of some of the top producers, arrangers, vocalists, musicians, and studio facilities available to help realize his dream to help children make a better future for themselves and the world. [http://www.efflearn.com/product_info.php/cPath/56/products_id/149]

Griswold also served as a consultant to the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]] as Vice-President of the Minnesota Futurists and was appointed by Gov. [[Arne Carlson]] to the Minnesota Early Childhood Care and Education Council.

Griswold wrote ''How To Attract Money'' (published by Hachette Book Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/authors_Robert-E-Griswold-(1017909)_Bibliography.aspx Bob Griswold at Hachette Book Group]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly [[Warner Books]]), which deals with the relationship between self-esteem and financial success. It is based on one of his most popular self-help audio titles and has been printed in seven languages. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0446393312]

He has recently updated and expanded that work with his new book ''Attract Money and More''.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558482202]

==Ideas and teachings ==
Bob Griswold pioneered techniques for using the concepts of self-esteem, positive thinking, and the power of love to live a better life. Among the strategies and techniques that Bob has developed, copyrighted, and/or incorporated in his teaching are: a unique approach to meditative success known as Productive Meditation, Guided Imagery, Success Statements,  Mental Movie Visualization, 10 Minute Goal Setting, Whole-Brain Learning, and Music Affirmations, which are well-researched positive statements arranged and blended with carefully selected up-beat music and are featured in his While-U-Drive series of audios.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efflearn.com/about.php Effective Learning Systems, Inc. official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[File:Pantheon dome.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] was the [[List of largest domes|largest dome in the world]] for more than a millennium and is the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome to this day&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanconcrete.com/ The Roman Pantheon: The Triumph of Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Roman architectural revolution''', also known as the '''Concrete revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeLaine|1990|p=407}}; {{harvnb|Rook|1992|pp=18f.}}; {{harvnb|Gardner|2005|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the widespread use in [[Roman architecture]] of the previously little-used architectural forms of the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], and [[dome]]. For the first time in history, their potential was fully exploited in the construction of a wide range of civil engineering structures, public buildings, and military facilities. These included [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|baths]], [[List of Roman bridges|bridges]], [[Circus (building)#List of Roman circuses|circuses]], [[List of Roman dams and reservoirs|dams]], [[List of Roman domes|domes]], [[Roman harbour|harbour]]s, and [[Roman temple|temples]].

A crucial factor in this development that saw [[List of ancient architectural records|a trend to monumental architecture]] was the invention of [[Roman concrete]] (also called [[opus caementicium]]), which led to the liberation of the shape from the dictate of the traditional materials of stone and brick.&lt;ref name="Ward-Perkins 1956, 219"/&gt;   

{{ quote
| For the first time in recorded history we find evidence of an interest in the shapes of the space contained strong enough to outweigh the functional logic of the masonry masses that contained it. There was nothing new in the employment of curvilinear or polygonal forms, as such...But in so far as such buildings incorporated curvilinear or polygonal rooms and corridors, the shapes of these were determined by the form of the building as a whole, not by any aesthetic principle.
| &lt;ref name="Ward-Perkins 1956, 219"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward-Perkins|1956|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

The development of Roman architecture, however, did not remain limited to these new forms and  materials. An unrelated process of architectural innovation continued unabated, which, although less conspicuous, proved their usefulness for solving structural problems and found their way permanently into Western architecture, such as the [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel arch]], the independent [[corbel]], and the metal-tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeLaine|1990|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiosis''' (from the {{lang-el|σημείωσις}}, ''sēmeíōsis'', a derivation of the verb {{lang|grc|σημειῶ}}, ''sēmeiô'', "to mark") is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], including the production of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Briefly – semiosis is sign process. The term was introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of [[sign relation]]s, or [[semiotics]]. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

==Introduction to theory==

Peirce was interested primarily in [[logic]], while Saussure was interested primarily in [[linguistics]], which examines the functions and structures of [[language]]. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone.  With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other [[sign systems]] both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect.  One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many [[code (semiotics)|codes]] for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}.  Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an [[audience]].

==Discussion==
Semiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many ''things'' unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word "sign" is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. 

As an insect or animal, human or otherwise, moves through its environment (sometimes termed the [[umwelt]]), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]] data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background ''noise''. When this happens, the sign then triggers [[cognitive]] activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the [[semiosphere]], the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle:
*The plant, insect, or animal with the need to communicate (e.g., to recognise an object of food) will ''know'' what needs to be ''said'' and assess the best means of ''saying'' it (e.g., starting a searching behaviour);
*This information will then be [[encode (Semiotics)|encoded]] and relevant muscle groups will effect transmission — although to some extent intentional in the human, the actual movements of the body are autonomic, i.e. the individual is not aware of moving individual muscles, but achieves the desired result by an act of will (see [[H. L. A. Hart]] on the nature of an [[Philosophy of action|action]]);
*The audience filters ambient data and perceives the uttered code as a grouping of signs;
*The audience then interprets the signs (sometimes termed [[decode (Semiotics)|decoding]]) to attribute meaning. This involves matching the signs received against existing patterns and their meanings held in memory (i.e. it is learned and understood within the [[community]]). In plants, insects and animals, the results of a successful interpretation will be an observable response to the stimuli perceived.
In [[biology]], scout bees and ants will return home to ''tell'' the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed [[biosemiotics]], and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that [[endosymbiosis]], self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, [[autopoiesis]], and others are the general properties of all living systems. [[Thomas Sebeok]]  suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether ''something'' is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok's Thesis.

For humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and [[value (Semiotics)|values]] are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Social semiotics''' (also '''social semantics''')&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thibault, ''Agency and Consciousness in Discourse: Self-Other Dynamics as a Complex System'', Continuum, 2004, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of the field of [[semiotics]] which investigates human signifying practices in specific social and cultural circumstances, and which tries to explain [[meaning-making]] as a social practice. Semiotics, as originally defined by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], is "the science of the life of signs in society". Social semiotics expands on Saussure's founding insights by exploring the implications of the fact that the "codes" of language and communication are formed by social processes. The crucial implication here is that meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change.

Social semiotics is thus the study of the social dimensions of meaning, and of the power of human processes of signification and interpretation (known as semiosis) in shaping individuals and societies. Social semiotics focuses on [[social meaning-making]] practices of all types, whether visual, verbal or aural in nature (Thibault, 1991). These different systems for meaning-making, or possible "channels" (e.g. speech, writing, images) are known as semiotic modes. Semiotic modes can include visual, verbal, written, gestural and musical resources for communication. They also include various "multimodal" ensembles of any of these modes (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2001).

Social semiotics can include the study of how people design and interpret meanings, the study of texts, and the study of how semiotic systems are shaped by social interests and ideologies, and how they are adapted as society changes (Hodge and Kress, 1988). Structuralist semiotics in the tradition of Ferdinand de Saussure focused primarily on theorising semiotic systems or structures (termed ''[[Langue and parole|langue]]'' by de Saussure, which change diachronically, i.e. over longer periods of time). In contrast, social semiotics tries to account for the variability of semiotic practices termed ''[[Langue and parole|parole]]'' by Saussure. This altered focus shows how individual creativity, changing historical circumstances, and new social identities and projects can all change patterns of usage and design (Hodge and Kress, 1988). From a social semiotic perspective, rather than being fixed into unchanging "codes", signs are considered to be resources which people use and adapt (or "design") to make meaning. In these respects, social semiotics was influenced by, and shares many of the preoccupations of [[pragmatics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] and has much in common with [[cultural studies]] and [[critical discourse analysis]].

The main task of social semiotics is to develop analytical and theoretical frameworks which can explain meaning-making in a social context (Thibault, 1991).

==Halliday and the social semiotic in language==
Linguistic theorist, [[Michael Halliday]], introduced the term ‘social semiotics’ into linguistics, when he used the phrase in the title of his book, ''Language as Social Semiotic''. This work argues against the traditional separation between language and society, and exemplifies the start of a 'semiotic' approach, which broadens the narrow focus on written language in linguistics (1978).
For Halliday, languages evolve as systems of "meaning potential" (Halliday, 1978:39) or as sets of resources which influence what the speaker can do with language, in a particular social context. For example, for Halliday, the grammar of the English language is a system organised for the following three purposes (areas or "metafunctions"):
* Facilitating certain kinds of social and interpersonal interactions (interpersonal),
* Representing ideas about the world (ideational), and
* Connecting these ideas and interactions into meaningful texts and making them relevant to their context (textual) (1978:112).
Any sentence in English is composed like a musical composition, with one strand of its meaning coming from each of the three semiotic areas or metafunctions.  
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]] generalises Halliday’s essays &lt;ref&gt;Review of Language as Social Semiotic: The Social Interpretation of Language and Meaning by M. A.K. Halliday, reviewer: Greg Urban, University of Texas at Austin, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3 (Sep., 1981), pp. 659-661, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the American Anthropological Association https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~gurban/pdfs/reviews/Urban-Language_as_Social_Semiotic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on social semiotics into five premises:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semioticon.com/seo/S/social_semiotics.html#  Social Semiotics] - Semiotics Encyclopedia Online, E.J. Pratt Library, Victoria University, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ‘Language is a social fact’ (1978:1)
# ‘We shall not come to understand the nature of language if we pursue only the kinds of question about language that are formulated by linguists’ (1978:3)
#‘Language is as it is because of the functions it has evolved to serve in people’s lives’ (1978:4).
# Language has ‘metafunctions’, which in English are: ideational (‘about something’), interpersonal (’doing something’) and textual (‘the speaker’s text-forming potential’) (1978:112).
# Language is constituted as ‘a discrete network of options’ (1978:113)

==Social semiotics and critical linguistics==
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Robert Hodge]] and [[Gunther Kress]]'s ''Social Semiotics'' (1988) focused on the uses of semiotic systems in social practice. They explain that the social power of texts in society depends on interpretation: "Each producer of a message relies on its recipients for it to function as intended." (1988:4) This process of interpretation (semiosis) situates individual texts within discourses, the exchanges of interpretative communities. The work of interpretation can contest the power of hegemonic discourses. Hodge and Kress give the example of feminist activists defacing a sexist advertising billboard, and spray-painting it with a new, feminist message.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Text is only a trace of discourses, frozen and preserved, more or less reliable or misleading. Yet discourse disappears too rapidly, surrounding a flow of texts." (1988:8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hodge and Kress built on a range of traditions from linguistics (including [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Michael Halliday]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] and [[sociolinguistics]]), but the major impetus for their work is the critical perspective on ideology and society that originates with [[Marx]].

Hodge and Kress build a notion of semiosis as a dynamic process, where meaning is not determined  by rigid structures, or predefined cultural codes. They argue that [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s structuralist semiotics avoided addressing questions about creativity, movement, and change in language, possibly in reaction to the diachronic linguistic traditions of his time (the focus on the historical development from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This created a "problematic" legacy, with linguistic change relegated to the "contents of Saussure’s rubbish bin" (1988:16-17).

Instead, Hodge and Kress propose to account for change in semiosis through the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Meaning is a process, in their interpretation of Peirce. They refer to Peirce's triadic model of semiosis, which depicts the "action" of a sign as a limitless process of infinite semiosis, where one "interpretant" (or idea linked to a sign) generates another. The flow of these infinite processes of interpretation are constrained in Peirce's model, they claim, by the material world (the "object"), and cultural rules of thought, or "habit". (1988:20)

Social semiotics revisits De Saussure's doctrine of the "arbitrariness of the linguistic [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]". This notion rests on the argument that the signifier only has an [[arbitrary]] relationship to the signified) — in other words, that there is nothing about the sound or appearance of (verbal) signifiers (as, for example, the words "dog" or "chien") — to suggest what they signify. Hodge and Kress point out that questions of the [[referent]] become more complicated when semiotics moves beyond verbal language. On the one hand, there is the need to account for the continuum of relationships between the [[referent]] and the representation. Here, they draw on Pierce's differentiation between iconic signification (e.g. a colour photograph of smoke, where the signifier recreates the perceptual experience of the signified), indexical signification (e.g. a column of smoke, where there is a causal relationship between the physical signifier and the fire it might signify), and symbolic signification (e.g. the word "smoke", where the arbitrary link between signifier and signified is maintained by social convention).

Social semiotics also addresses the question of how societies and cultures maintain or shift these conventional bonds between signifier and signified. De Saussure was unwilling to answer this question, Hodge and Kress claim. This leaves the [[socially determinist]] implication that meanings and interpretations are dictated from above, by "the whims of an inscrutably powerful collective being, Society." For Hodge and Kress, social semiotics must respond to the question and  explain how the social shaping of meanings works in practice (1988:22).

==Social semiotics and multimodality==
Social semiotics is currently extending this general framework beyond its linguistic origins to account for the growing importance of sound and visual images, and how modes of communication are combined in both traditional and digital media ([[semiotics of social networking]]) (see, for example, Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996), thus approaching semiotics of culture (Randviir 2004). Theorists such as Gunther Kress and [[Theo Van Leeuwen|Theo van Leeuwen]] have built on Halliday's framework by providing new "grammars" for other semiotic modes. Like language, these grammars are seen as socially formed and changeable sets of available "resources" for making meaning, which are also shaped by the semiotic metafunctions originally identified by Halliday. The visual and aural modes have received particular attention. Accounting for [[multimodality]] (communication in and across a range of semiotic modes - verbal, visual, and aural) is considered a particularly important ongoing project, given the importance of the visual mode in contemporary communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">In [[applied mathematics]], the two-dimensional '''Spectral [[signal-to-noise ratio]]''' (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency {{harv|Unser|1987}}. It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the [[Fourier shell correlation]].

where &lt;math&gt;F_{r_i,k}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for image k for a pixel &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; at radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible convert the SSNR into an equivalent FRC using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
FRC = \frac{SSNR}{SSNR + 1}

'''Thermofluids'''&lt;ref&gt;http://mech.ubc.ca/undergraduate-students/thermofluids/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imeche.org/knowledge/industries/thermofluids&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of science and engineering encompassing four intersecting fields:
*[[Heat transfer]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Combustion]]

The term is a combination of "thermo", referring to heat, and "fluids", which refers to [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es and [[vapor]]s. [[Temperature]], [[pressure]], equations of state, and transport laws all play an important role in thermofluid problems.  [[Phase transition]] and [[chemical reactions]] may also be important in a thermofluid context.  The subject is sometimes also referred to as "thermal fluids".

==Heat Transfer==
[[Heat transfer]] is a discipline of [[thermal engineering]] that concerns the transfer of [[thermal energy]] from one physical system to another. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[heat conduction]], [[convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and phase-change transfer. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer.  

Sections include :
*[[Energy transfer]] by heat, work and mass
*[[Laws of thermodynamics]]
*[[Entropy]]
*[[Refrigeration]] Techniques
*Properties and nature of pure substances

===Applications===
*Engineering : Predicting and analysing the performance of machines

==Thermodynamics==
[[Thermodynamics]] is the science of [[energy]] conversion involving heat and other forms of energy, most notably [[mechanical work]]. It studies and interrelates the [[macroscopic]] variables, such as [[temperature]], [[volume]] and [[pressure]], which describe physical, thermodynamic systems.

==Fluid Mechanics==
[[Fluid Mechanics]] the study of the physical forces at work during fluid flow. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid [[kinematics]], the study of fluid motion, and [[fluid dynamics]], the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion, which can further be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest, and fluid kinetics, the study of fluids in motion. Some of its more interesting concepts include [[momentum]] and reactive forces in fluid flow and fluid machinery theory and performance.

Sections include:
*[[Fluid flow]] and continuity
*[[Momentum]] in fluids
*Static and dynamic forces on a boundary
*[[Laminar flow|Laminar]] and turbulent flow
*Metacentric height and vessel stability

===Applications===
*Pump Design.
*Hydro-Electric Power Generation.
*Naval Architecture.

==Combustion==
[[Combustion]] is the sequence of [[exothermic]] chemical reactions between a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidant]] accompanied by the production of [[heat]] and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can result in the production of light  in the form of either glowing or a [[flame]]. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially [[hydrocarbons]]) in the gas, liquid or solid phase.

'''Universeum''' is a public science centre and museum in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] that opened in 2001. It is a part of ''Evenemangsstråket'', the ''thoroughfare of events'' – close to [[Korsvägen]] and Skånegatan – which includes sights of interest like [[Scandinavium]], [[Ullevi]], [[Svenska Mässan]] (Swedish Exhibition Centre), [[Liseberg]] and the [[Museum of World Culture]].

Universeum is divided into six sections, each containing experiment workshops and a collection of [[reptile]]s, [[fish]] and [[insect]]s. Universeum occasionally gives Swedish secondary school students a chance to debate with [[Nobel prize]]-winners and professors.

==Main sections==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">'''Vaginal photoplethysmography''' ('''VPG''', '''VPP''') is a [[photoplethysmogram|technique using light]] to measure the [[vasocongestion|amount of blood]] in the walls of the [[vagina]].  The device that is used is called a vaginal [[photometer]].

==Use==
The device is used to try to obtain an objective measure of a woman's [[sexual arousal]]. There is an overall poor correlation (r = 0.26) between women's self-reported levels of desire and their VPG readings.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010| title = Agreement of Self-Reported and Genital Measures of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 5–56 | pmc=2811244 | pmid=20049519 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9556-9 |vauthors=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Lalumière ML, Laan E, Grimbos T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrument==
The instrument used in the procedure is called vaginal [[photometer]]. The device has a clear shell, inside of which is a light source and a [[photocell]], which senses reflected light.  The use of the device is done with the assumption that the more light that is scattered back, and that the photocell senses, the more blood is in the walls of the vagina.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007/&gt; 

The output of the VPG can be filtered into two types of signals, which have different properties. The [[direct current]] signal is a measure of vaginal blood volume (VBV) and reflects the total blood volume in the [[vagina|vaginal tissues]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;Hatch, J. P. [“Vaginal photoplethysmography: Methodological considerations”],”Archives of Sexual Behavior, 8, 357–374”, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=February 2018}} The [[alternating current]] signal is a measure of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) and reflects the pressure change within the [[blood vessel]]s of the vaginal wall associated with each heartbeat.&lt;ref name="Hatch" /&gt; While changes in VBV occur in response to sexual and anxiety-inducing stimuli, changes in VPA only occur in response to sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Laan, E., Everaerd, W., &amp; Evers, A. [http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/21166/21166.PDF?sequence=1 “Assessment of female sexual arousal: Response specificity and construct validity”], “Psychophysiology, 32, 476–485”, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=February 2018}} 
 
VPA is defined as the [[amplitude|peak-to-trough amplitude]] of the vaginal pulse wave. It is calculated by subtracting the means of all troughs from the means of all peaks experienced during stimulus presentation.VPA lacks an absolute scale of measurement; each unit of change (mV) does not correspond directly with a physiological change. Since VPA does not have a standard unit of measurement, it is difficult for researchers to make between-participant comparisons.&lt;ref name=Chivers2010/&gt;

==History==
VPG was first introduced in the 1960s by Palti and Berovici, who affixed a light source and photosensitive cell onto a [[speculum (medical)|gynecological speculum]] and recorded vaginal pulse waves.&lt;ref name=Jannsen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jannsen|first1=Erick|last2=Prause|first2=Nicole|last3=Geer|first3=James H.|editor1-last=Cacioppo|editor1-first=John T.|editor2-last=Tassinary|editor2-first=Louis G.|editor3-last=Berntson|editor3-first=Gary|title=Handbook of Psychophysiology|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139461931|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Psychophysiology.html?id=E7hRKwVBXb4C|language=en|chapter=Chapter 11: The Sexual Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Molenkamp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molenkamp|first1=Bert|title=SexLab - Equipment &amp; Instruments - Vaginal Photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/ei-vp-uvaprobe.html|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palti, Y. &amp; Bercovici, B.

'''Wheeler James North''' (January 2, 1922 – December 20, 2002), born in [[San Francisco, California]], was a marine biologist and [[Environmental science|environmental scientist]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He is best known for his pioneering work to understand the ecology of California’s coastal kelp forests, and pioneering work in biomass fuels and the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

== Early life, military service and education ==
North was born January 2, 1922 in San Francisco to Wheeler O. and Florence (Ross) North, and grew up at a mining camp at La Fe in [[Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]], as his father was a mining engineer and his mother was an assay chemist.  In 1927, the family moved to [[La Jolla, California]].  In 1940 North graduated from [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]] and entered college at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).  While still in college in December 1942, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]], which allowed him to complete his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1944.  After training in U.S. Army [[Officers Candidate School]] at [[Fort Monmouth]] in New Jersey, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Signal Corps and assigned to the [[Philippines]].  However, he arrived in Southeast Asia after [[VJ Day]] in August 1945 but stayed in the Philippines and [[Japan]] as part of the American occupying forces until August 1946.  After two years working with the U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory in [[San Diego]], North returned to Caltech in September 1948 and completed a second bachelor's degree in biology in 1950.  He earned masters and Ph.D. degrees in [[Biological Oceanography]] at the [[University of California]] [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in 1953 studying in the laboratory of Denis Fox.  He undertook postdoctoral work with a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship at the [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]] and [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/00/OH_North_W.pdf | title= Wheeler J. North oral history (1998) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
North began his academic career teaching at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1953, after which he joined the faculty of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in September 1962.  Although North taught [[marine biology]] courses at the Caltech main campus in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], he spent much of his time undertaking research at the Caltech’s [[Kerckhoff marine laboratory|Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] in [[Corona Del Mar, California|Corona del Mar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/LXVI/north.html| title= Wheeler J. North (1922-2002) | publisher= California Institute of Technology | accessdate= December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North’s principal research interest was [[marine ecology]], specifically the kelp beds off Southern California and the [[population ecology]] of sea urchins. He studied the effects of sewage outfalls and [[El Niño]] on [[kelp forests]], and the predation of kelp by [[sea urchins]].  He served as a consultant for California’s kelp-harvesting industry.  He was one of the first marine scientists to employ [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] technology for marine research beginning as a student in 1949.  While at Scripps, he worked with group studying the physiology of diving and was a pioneer in establishing scientific diving safety protocols.  He was a consulting scientist after the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and after [[1973 oil crisis]], he studied the possibility of [[kelp| kelp farms]] to produce [[Algae fuel|biomass]] as an alternative fuel.  He contributed to the growth of the [[Kelp#Commercial kelp production in China|kelp farming]] industry in China.  He also studied the ecological effects of warm-water discharges from [[nuclear power plants]] on kelp forests, and in the early 1990s he undertook studies to reduce atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] using [[Biomass (ecology)|marine biomass]] and [[clathrate hydrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/34/|title=Interview with Wheeler J.
