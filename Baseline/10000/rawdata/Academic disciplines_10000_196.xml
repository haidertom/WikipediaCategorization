An '''abortive flower'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Arma A. | title=Abortive Flower Buds of Trillium | journal=Botanical Gazette | year=1896 | jstor=2464003 | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=402–403 | issn=0006-8071 | doi=10.1086/327429}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[flower]] that has a [[stamen]] but an under developed, or no [[pistil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/abortive|title=Websters Dictionary 1828 - Webster's Dictionary 1828 - abortive|website=Websters Dictionary 1828|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It falls without producing fruit or seeds, due to its inability to [[wikt:fructify|fructify]]. Flowers require both male and female organs to reproduce, and the pistils and ovary serve as female organs, while the stamens are considered male organs.

Illustrative examples include ''[[Urginea Nagarjunae|Urginea nagarjunae]]'' and ''[[Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae]]''.

==== Causes of Flower Abortion ====
Pollinated flowers and fruits can abort selectively. It could be because of the order of pollination, the number of developing seeds, pollen source, or some combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=A G|date=1981|title=Flower and Fruit Abortion: Proximate Causes and Ultimate Functions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001345|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=253–279|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001345|issn=0066-4162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers and fruits can also abort because of outside causes like insufficient light, unsuitable photo-period, high temperature, nutrient deficiency, [[ethylene]], [[Drought tolerance|drought stress]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gpnmag.com/article/causes-of-flower-bud-abortion/|title=Causes of Flower Bud Abortion - Greenhouse Product News|work=Greenhouse Product News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is research to suggest that random selective abortions based on the timing of fertilization could increase the genetic quality of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezoe|first=Hideo|date=2018-06-09|title=Excessive flower production as an anti-predator strategy: when is random flower abortion favored?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10144-018-0625-6|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|volume=60|issue=3|pages=275–286|doi=10.1007/s10144-018-0625-6|issn=1438-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of the flower also has an effect on the percentage of abortion. The older the flower, the more likely it is to be aborting the fruit or pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Nesta|date=1924|title=On The Determination of the Percentage of Abortive Pollen in Plants|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/2/1/65|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=2|pages=65-73|via=The Company of Biologists Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antiscience''' is a position that rejects [[science]] and the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Anti-science|author=Gerald Holton |year=1993|isbn=9780674792982|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; People holding antiscientific views do not accept that science as an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] method can generate [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] knowledge. They also contend that scientific [[reductionism]] in particular is an inherently limited means to reach understanding of a complex world.

==History==
In the beginnings of the [[scientific revolution]], scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]] found themselves in conflict with those such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], who were skeptical of whether science was a satisfactory way to obtain genuine knowledge about the world.

Hobbes' stance is sometimes regarded as an antiscience position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his ''Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics,''...[published in 1656, Hobbes] distinguished 'demonstrable' fields, as 'those the construction of the subject whereof is in the power of the artist himself,' from 'indemonstrable' ones 'where the causes are to seek for.' We can only know the causes of what we make. So geometry is demonstrable, because 'the lines and figures from which we reason are drawn and described by ourselves' and 'civil philosophy is demonstrable, because we make the commonwealth ourselves.' But we can only speculate about the natural world, because 'we know not the construction, but seek it from the effects.'&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shapiro, ''[https://shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/skinner-and-pettit.pdf Reflections on Skinner and Pettit],'' Hobbes Studies, 22 (2009), pp. 185–91, citation from pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was also Hobbes who "put forth the idea of the significance of the nonrational in human behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Richard H Jones, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUgnio874NUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reductionism: Analysis and the Fullness of Reality],'' Lewisburg, Pa: Bucknell University Press, 2000, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Jones goes on to group Hobbes along with others he classes as 'antireductionists' and 'individualists,' such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[J S Mill]], and then he adds [[Karl Popper]], [[John Rawls]], and [[E. O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in his ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'', claimed that science can lead to [[immorality]]. "Rousseau argues that the progression of the sciences and arts has caused the corruption of virtue and morality" and his "critique of science has much to teach us about the dangers involved in our political commitment to scientific progress, and about the ways in which the future happiness of mankind might be secured".&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI3176656/ Jeffrey J S Black, ''Rousseau's critique of science: A commentary on the Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts'', Boston College, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Rousseau does not state in his Discourses that sciences are ''necessarily'' bad, and states that figures like [[René Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]] should be held in high regard. In the conclusion to the Discourses, he says that these (aforementioned) can cultivate sciences to great benefit, and that morality's corruption is mostly because of society's bad influence on scientists.

[[William Blake]] reacted strongly against the work of Isaac Newton in his paintings and writings, and is seen as being perhaps the earliest (and almost certainly the most prominent and enduring) example of what is seen by historians as the [[aesthetic]] or [[Romanticism|romantic]] antiscience response. For example, in his 1795 poem [[Auguries of Innocence]], Blake describes the beautiful and natural [[European robin|robin redbreast]] imprisoned by the materialistic cage of Newtonian mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/blake/612/ William Blake, Auguries of Innocence]&lt;/ref&gt; In Blake's [[Newton (Blake)|painting of Newton]], he is depicted "as a misguided hero whose gaze was directed only at sterile geometrical diagrams drawn on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~his291/Newton.html Notes to Blake's ''Newton'', at Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt; Blake thought that "Newton, Bacon, and [[John Locke|Locke]] with their emphasis on reason were nothing more than 'the three great teachers of [[atheism]], or Satan's Doctrine'...the picture progresses from exuberance and colour on the left, to sterility and blackness on the right. In Blake's view Newton brings not light, but night".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learning/worksinfocus/blake/imagin/cast_05.html ''Newton: Personification of Man Limited by Reason'', Tate Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt; In a poem, [[W.H. Auden]] summarises Blake's anti-scientific views by saying that he "[broke] off relations in a curse, with the Newtonian Universe".&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Auden, "New Year Letter, 1940", in Collected Poems, Edited by Edward Mendelson, London: Faber, 1994, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent biographer of Newton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isaac-newton.org/ Stephen D Snobelen, ''Writings on Newton'', 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; considers him more as a [[renaissance]] [[alchemy|alchemist]], natural philosopher, and magician rather than a true representative of scientific illuminism, as popularized by [[Voltaire]] and other illuminist [[Newtonianism|Newtonians]].

Antiscience issues are seen as a fundamental consideration in the transition from 'pre-science' or '[[protoscience]]' such as that evident in [[alchemy]]. Many disciplines that pre-date the widespread adoption and acceptance of the scientific method, such as [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], are not seen as anti-science. However, some of the orthodoxies within those disciplines that predate a scientific approach (such as those orthodoxies repudiated by the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) are seen as being a product of an anti-scientific stance.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated within [[The Gay Science]] that “in Science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as is said with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of a hypothesis, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative fiction, maybe they be granted admission and even a certain value within the realm of knowledge—though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But does this not mean, more precisely considered, that a conviction may obtain admission to Science only when it ceases to be a conviction? Would not the discipline of the scientific spirit begin with this, no longer to permit oneself any convictions? Probably that is how it is. But one must still ask whether it is not the case that, in order that this discipline could begin, a conviction must have been there already, and even such a commanding and unconditional one that it sacrificed all other convictions for its own sake. It is clear that Science too rests on a faith; there is no Science ‘without presuppositions.’ The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to the extent that the principle, the faith, the conviction is expressed: ‘nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it, everything else has only second-rate value.”&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=blfwSlxhjvAC&amp;pg=PT278&amp;lpg=PT278&amp;dq=Probably+that+is+how+it+is.+But+one+must+still+ask+whether+it+is+not+the+case+that,+in+order+that+this+discipline+could+begin,+a+conviction+must+have+been+there+already,+and+even+such+a+commanding+and+unconditional+one+that+it+sacrificed+all+other+convictions+for+its+own+sake.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ksQoq4RzJH&amp;sig=iJm1fCqz9j4amUVzWLes1SMpgD8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTucrynLLbAhUFmJQKHTS1CY8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Probably%20that%20is%20how%20it%20is.%20But%20one%20must%20still%20ask%20whether%20it%20is%20not%20the%20case%20that%2C%20in%20order%20that%20this%20discipline%20could%20begin%2C%20a%20conviction%20must%20have%20been%20there%20already%2C%20and%20even%20such%20a%20commanding%20and%20unconditional%20one%20that%20it%20sacrificed%20all%20other%20convictions%20for%20its%20own%20sake.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '[[scientism]]' derives from [[science studies]] and is a term spawned and used by [[sociologist]]s and [[philosophers of science]] to describe the views, beliefs and behavior of strong supporters of science. It is commonly used in a pejorative sense, for individuals who seem to be treating science in a similar way to a religion. The term [[reductionism]] is occasionally used in a similarly pejorative way (as a more subtle attack on scientists). However, some scientists feel comfortable being labelled as reductionists, while agreeing that there might be conceptual and philosophical shortcomings of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Klir, ''Facets of Systems Science,'' New York: Springer, 1991, pp. 263–65&lt;/ref&gt;

However, non-reductionist (see [[Emergentism]]) views of science have been formulated in varied forms in several scientific fields like [[statistical physics]], [[chaos theory]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[ecology]], [[information theory]], etc. Such fields tend to assume that strong interaction between units produce new phenomena in higher levels that cannot be accounted for solely by reductionism. For example, it is not valuable (or currently possible) to describe a chess game or gene networks using quantum mechanics. The emergentist view of science ("More is Different", in the words of Nobel physicist Philip W. Anderson)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

One expression of antiscience is the "denial of [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] and... legitimisation of alternatives", {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and that the results of scientific findings do not always represent any underlying reality, but can merely reflect the ideology of dominant groups within society.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C.

Edward Freeman, ''Organization Studies and the New Pragmatism: Positivism, Anti-Positivism, and the Search for Ethics,'' Organization Science, 9.2, Mar–Apr. 1998, pp. 123–40&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, science is associated with the political Right and is seen as a belief system that is conservative and conformist, that suppresses [[innovation]], that resists change and that acts dictatorially. This includes the view, for example, that science has a "[[bourgeois]] and/or [[Eurocentric]] and/or [[masculinist]] world-view".&lt;ref&gt;Alan D Sokal, ''What the Social Text Affair Does and Does not Prove,'' Critical Quarterly, 40.2, July 1998, pp. 3–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of antiscience thinking may be traced back to the reaction of [[Romanticism]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], this movement is often referred to as the '[[Counter-Enlightenment]]'. Romanticism emphasizes that intuition, passion and organic links to Nature are primal values and that rational thinking is merely a product of human life. There are many modern examples of [[conservative]] antiscience polemics. Primary among the latter are the polemics about [[evolution]]ary theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = William D. Anderson Jr. |date=September 2003 | title = Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science | journal = [[Copeia]] | volume = 2003 | issue = 3 | pages=675–77 | doi=10.1643/ot-03-047}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern [[cosmology]] teaching in high schools, and [[environmental issues]] related to [[global warming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/06/30/climate_act/index.html Joseph Romm, "Anti-science conservatives must be stopped", Salon.com, June 30, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024037/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/06/30/climate_act/index.html |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]| title = [[The Republican War on Science]]| publisher = Basic Books| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[energy crisis]].

Characteristics of antiscience associated with the right include the appeal to [[conspiracy theories]] to explain why scientists believe what they believe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Pascal Diethelm | author2 = Martin McKee | year = 2009 | title = Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? | journal = European Journal of Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages=2–4 | doi = 10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 | pmid=19158101}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to undermine the confidence or power usually associated to science (e.g. in [[Global warming conspiracy theory|global warming conspiracy theories]]).

===Religious===
{{main article|Relationship between religion and science}}

In this context, antiscience may be considered dependent on religious,  moral and cultural arguments. For this kind of religious antiscience philosophy, science is an anti-spiritual and materialistic force that undermines traditional values, ethnic identity and accumulated historical wisdom in favor of [[reason]] and [[cosmopolitanism]]. In particular, the traditional and ethnic values emphasized are similar to those of [[white supremacist]] [[Christian Identity]] theology, but similar right-wing views have been developed by radically conservative sects of [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. New religious movements such as [[New Age]] thinking also criticize the scientific worldview as favouring a [[reductionist]], [[atheist]], or [[materialist]] philosophy.

A frequent basis of antiscientific sentiment is religious [[theism]] with literal interpretations of sacred text. Here, scientific theories that conflict with what is considered divinely-inspired knowledge are regarded as flawed. Over the centuries religious institutions have been hesitant to embrace such ideas as [[heliocentrism]] and [[planetary orbit|planetary motion]] because they contradicted the dominant understanding of various passages of scripture.  More recently the body of creation theologies known collectively as [[creationism]], including the [[teleological]] theory of [[intelligent design]], have been promoted by religious theists in response to the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon D.

To the extent that attempts to overcome antiscience sentiments have failed, some argue that a different approach to science advocacy is needed. One such approach says that it is important to develop a more accurate understanding of those who deny science (avoiding stereotyping them as backward and uneducated) and also to attempt [[science outreach|outreach]] via those who share cultural values with target audiences, such as scientists who also hold religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidson |first1=Gregg |last2=Hill |first2=Carol |last3=Wolgemuth |first3=Ken |title=We Need a Paradigm Shift in Science Advocacy |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==
Historically, antiscience first arose as a reaction against [[scientific materialism]]. The 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had ushered in "the ideal of a unified system of all the sciences",&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;Isaiah Berlin, The Proper Study of Mankind, London: Pimlico, 1997, p328&lt;/ref&gt; but there were those fearful of this notion, who "felt that constrictions of reason and science, of a single all-embracing system... were in some way constricting, an obstacle to their vision of the world, chains on their imagination or feeling".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; Antiscience then is a rejection of "the scientific model [or paradigm]... with its strong implication that only that which was quantifiable, or at any rate, measurable... was real".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; In this sense, it comprises a "critical attack upon the total claim of the new scientific method to dominate the entire field of human knowledge".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; However, scientific positivism ([[logical positivism]]) does not deny the reality of non-measurable phenomena, only that those phenomena should not be adequate to scientific investigation. Moreover, [[positivism]], as a philosophical basis for the [[scientific method]], is not consensual or even dominant in the scientific community (see [[philosophy of science]]).

Three major areas of antiscience can be seen in philosophy, sociology, and ecology. The following quotes explore this aspect of the subject.

===Philosophy===
Philosophical objections against science are often objections about the role of reductionism. For example, in the field of psychology, "both reductionists and antireductionists accept that... non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "epistemological antireductionism holds that, given our finite mental capacities, we would not be able to grasp the ultimate physical explanation of many complex phenomena even if we knew the laws governing their ultimate
constituents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9653712&amp;dopt=Abstract Nagel T. "Reductionism and antireductionism". Novartis Found Symp. 1998; 213:3–10; discussion 10-4, 73–75.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some see antiscience as "common...in academic settings...many people see that there are problems in demarcation between science, scientism, and pseudoscience resulting in an antiscience stance. Some argue that nothing can be known for sure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance1.org/Conferences/NLCCWI2006post/materials/80-4Gambrill.pdf Eileen Gambrill, Evidence based practice, an alternative to authority based practice, Families in Society, the Journal of Contemporary Human Services, 80.4, 1999, 341–50] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929202018/http://alliance1.org/Conferences/NLCCWI2006post/materials/80-4Gambrill.pdf |date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers are "divided as to whether reduction should be a central strategy for understanding the world".&lt;ref name="ToddJones"&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00341.x?journalCode=meta Todd Jones, Reductionism and Antireductionism: Rights and Wrongs, Metaphilosophy, Volume 35, Number 5, October 2004, pp. 614–47]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many agree that "there are, nevertheless, reasons why we want science to discover properties and explanations other than reductive physical ones".&lt;ref name="ToddJones" /&gt; Such issues stem "from an antireductionist worry that there is no absolute conception of reality, that is, a characterization of reality such as... science claims to provide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csupomona.edu/~pwross/Sensibility%20Theory%20and%20Conservative%20Complacency.DOC Peter W. Ross and Dale Turner, "Sensibility Theory and Conservative Complacency"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619191036/http://www.csupomona.edu/~pwross/Sensibility%20Theory%20and%20Conservative%20Complacency.DOC |date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is close to the Kantian view that reality is ultimately unknowable and all models are just imperfect approximations to it.

===Sociology===
Sociologist [[Thomas F. Gieryn|Thomas Gieryn]] refers to "some sociologists who might appear to be antiscience".&lt;ref name="Gieryn"&gt;{{cite journal
  |title = ''Real Science: What It Is and What It Means'' by John Ziman
  |last = Gieryn
  |first = Thomas F.
  |journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]
  |publisher = [[History of Science Society]]
  |issn = 1545-6994
  |volume = 93
  |issue = 3
  |year = 2002
  |pages = 544–45
  |jstor = 3080621
  |via = [[JSTOR]]
  |registration = y
  |doi=10.1086/374156
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "philosophers and antiscience types", he contends, may have presented "unreal images of science that threaten the believability of scientific knowledge",&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; or appear to have gone "too far in their antiscience deconstructions".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; The question often lies in how much scientists conform to the standard ideal of "communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and... skepticism".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; Unfortunately, "scientists don't always conform... scientists do get passionate about pet theories; they do rely on reputation in judging a scientist's work; they do pursue fame and gain via research".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; Thus, they may show inherent biases in their work. "[Many] scientists are not as rational and logical as the legend would have them, nor are they as illogical or irrational as some relativists might say".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt;

===Ecology and health sphere===
Within the ecological and health spheres, [[Richard Levins|Levins]] identifies a conflict "not between science and antiscience, but rather between different pathways for science and technology; between a commodified science-for-profit and a gentle science for humane goals; between the sciences of the smallest parts and the sciences of dynamic wholes... [he] offers proposals for a more holistic, integral approach to understanding and addressing environmental issues".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Levins, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/Q4TN-Q9U2-ER56-3T1R Whose Scientific Method? Scientific Methods for a Complex World], New Solutions: ''A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy'', Vol.13,3, 2003, 261–74&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are also common within the scientific community, with for example, scientists being prominent in environmental campaigns warning of environmental dangers such as [[ozone depletion]] and the [[greenhouse effect]]. It can also be argued that this version of antiscience comes close to that found in the medical sphere, where patients and practitioners may choose to reject science and adopt a [[pseudoscientific]] approach to health problems. This can be both a practical and a conceptual shift and has attracted strong criticism: "therapeutic touch, a healing technique based upon the laying-on of hands, has found wide acceptance in the nursing profession despite its lack of scientific plausibility. Its acceptance is indicative of a broad antiscientific trend in nursing".&lt;ref name="Glazer"&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1466-769X.2000.00061.x?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=nup Sarah Glazer, "Therapeutic touch and postmodernism in nursing", Nursing Philosophy (2001) 2(3), 196–212.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazer also criticises the therapists and patients, "for abandoning the biological underpinnings of nursing and for misreading philosophy in the service of an antiscientific world-view".&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; In contrast, Brian Martin criticized Gross and Levitt by saying that "[their] basic approach is to attack [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivists]] for not being [[Positivism|positivists]],"&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96sss1.html Brian Martin, Social Construction of an 'Attack on Science', ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 26, No. 1, February 1996, pp. 161–73.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that science is "presented as a unitary object, usually identified with scientific knowledge. It is portrayed as neutral and objective. Second, science is claimed to be under attack by 'antiscience' which is composed essentially of ideologues who are threats to the neutrality and objectivity that are fundamental to science. Third, a highly selective attack is made on the arguments of 'antiscience'".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Such people allegedly then "routinely equate critique of scientific knowledge with hostility to science, a jump that is logically unsupportable and empirically dubious".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Having then "constructed two artificial entities, a unitary 'science' and a unitary 'academic left', each reduced to [[epistemology|epistemological]] essences, Gross and Levitt proceed to attack. They pick out figures in each of several areas – science studies, postmodernism, feminism, environmentalism, AIDS activism – and criticise their critiques of science".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

The writings of Young serve to illustrate more antiscientific views: "The strength of the antiscience movement and of alternative technology is that their advocates have managed to retain Utopian vision while still trying to create concrete instances of it".&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;[http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html Robert M. Young, Science is Social Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; "The real social, ideological and economic forces shaping science...[have] been opposed to the point of suppression in many quarters. Most scientists hate it and label it 'antiscience'. But it is urgently needed, because it makes science self-conscious and hopefully self-critical and accountable with respect to the forces which shape research priorities, criteria, goals".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;

Genetically modified foods also bring about antiscience sentiment. The general public has recently become more aware of the dangers of a poor diet, as there have been numerous studies that show that the two are inextricably linked.&lt;ref name="Foreman"&gt;[http://www.biotech-info.net/CTF_remarks.html Carol Tucker Foreman, Genetic Modification of Foods: The Public's Mistrust of Science and Science's Misunderstanding of the Public, "Consumer Choice"]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-science dictates that science is untrustworthy, because it is never complete and always being revised, which would be a probable cause for the fear that the general public has of genetically modified foods despite scientific reassurance that such foods are safe.

Antivaccinationists rely on whatever comes to hand presenting some of their arguments as if scientific, however a strain of antiscience is part of their approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885912000821 | doi=10.1016/j.humimm.2012.03.014 | volume=73 | issue=8 | title=The clinician's guide to the anti-vaccinationists' galaxy | journal=Human Immunology | pages=859–66 | pmid=22504410 | date=Aug 2012| author1=Poland | first1=G. A | last2=Jacobson | first2=R. M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to reductionism and positivism==
{{refimprove|date=February 2008}}

===On the limitations of models===
A common antiscientific point of contention arises from the fact that mathematical models do not capture the full reality of existence, as can be seen in this quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formulas of mathematical models are "artificial constructions, logical figments with no necessary relation to the outside world". These models always "leave out the richest and most important part of human experience...daily life, history, human laws and institutions, the modes of human self-expression".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Isaiah Berlin, ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder,'' Princeton: Princeton Univ Press, 2000, pp. 110–23&lt;/ref&gt; A failure to appreciate the subtle complexity of social worlds, means they get excluded from the formulas, even though, "no easy reductionism will do justice to the material". This approach often fails to concentrate "on social structures, processes, and actions in a specific sense (inequality, mobility, classes, strata, ethnicity, gender relations, urbanization, work and life of different types of people, not just elites)", and so tends to generate mostly meaningless oversimplifications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also a common antiscientific point to state that ''verbal'' (say, literary and non-mathematical) models are  poor representations of reality. If it is clear that a particular [[statistical]] or [[psychological]] study about [[romantic love]] or [[religious ecstasy]] (see [[neurotheology]]) captures only a tiny fraction of such human experiences, literary accounts and simplified verbal models also cannot adequately convey their full complexity. Both verbal and mathematical models are (partial) maps of reality, providing different points of view, but inherently incomplete descriptions of the territory of human and [[universe]] existence (see [[map–territory relation]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

&lt;/ref&gt; that extends the [[Axiomatic design]]&lt;ref&gt;Suh (1990). ''The Principles of Design'', Oxford University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-504345-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (AD) method. APDL covers the whole [[Product_lifecycle_management#Phases_of_product_lifecycle_and_corresponding_technologies|product lifecycle]] including early factors that affect the entire cycle such as development testing, input constraints and system components.

APDL provides an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative and incremental]] way for a team of transdisciplinary members to approach [[Holism|holistic]] product development. A practical outcome includes capturing and managing product [[design knowledge]]. The APDL model addresses some weak [[Design pattern|patterns]] experienced in previous development models regarding quality of the design, [[requirements management]], [[change management]], [[project management]], and communication between [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. Practicing APDL may reduce development time and [[Project cost management|project cost]].

== Overview ==
APDL adds the Test [[Problem domain|domain]] and four new characteristics to Axiomatic design (AD): Input Constraints in the Functional Domain; Systems Components in the Physical Domain; Process Variables tied to System Components instead of Design Parameters; and Customer Needs mapped to Functional Requirements and Input Constraints.

APDL proposes a V-shaped process to develop the Design Parameters and System Components (detailed design). Start top-down with Process Variables (PV) and Component Test Cases (CTC) to complete the PV, CTC, and Functional Test Cases (FTC); And after build, test the product with a bottom-up approach.

== APDL Domains ==
;Customer domain
[[Voice of the customer|Customer Needs]] (CN) are elements that the customer seeks in a product or system.

;Functional domain
[[Functional requirement|Functional Requirements]] (FR) completely characterize the minimum performance to be met by the design solution, product etc. FR are documented in requirement specifications (RS).

Input [[Constraint (mathematics)|Constraints]] (IC) are included in the functional domain along with the FR. IC are specific to overall design goals and are imposed externally by CN, product users or conditions of use, such as regulations. IC are derived from CN and then revised based on other constraints that the product has to comply with but not mentioned in the Customer Domain.

;Physical domain
The Design Parameters (DP) are the elements of the design solution in the physical domain that are chosen to satisfy the specified FRs. DPs can be conceptual design solutions, subsystems, components, or component attributes.

System Components (SC) provide a categorical design solution in the DP, where the categories represent physical parts in the Physical Domain.  The SC hierarchy represents the physical [[system architecture]] or product tree. The method for categorizing varies. [[Steven D. Eppinger|Eppinger]] portrays general categories as system, subsystem, and component Eppinger (2001). NASA  uses system, segment, element, subsystem, assembly, subassembly, and part (NASA, 1995).

SC makes it possible to perform [[Design structure matrix|Design Structure Matrixes]] (DSM), change management, component-based cost management and impact analysis, and provides framework for capturing structural information and requirement traceability.

;Process domain
[[Process variable|Process Variables]] (PV) identify and describe the controls and processes to produce SC.

;Test domain
A functional test consists of a set of Functional Test Cases (FTC). FTC are [[System testing|system tests]] used to verify that FR are satisfied by the system. [[Black-box testing]] is the software analog to FTC. At the end of the system development, a functional test verifies that the requirements of the system are met.

Component Test Cases (CTC) are a physical analog to [[White-box testing]]. CTC verify that components satisfy the allocated FRs and ICs. Each system component is tested before it is integrated into the system to make sure that the requirements and constraints allocated to that component are all satisfied.

[[File:altstetten.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Manesse]]: [[Konrad von Altstetten]].]]
The '''Bibliotheca Palatina''' ("[[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] library") of [[Heidelberg]] was the most important library of the [[German Renaissance]], numbering approximately 5,000 printed books and 3,524 manuscripts. The Bibliotheca was a prominent prize captured during the Thirty Years' War, taken as booty by [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]], and given to the Pope in a symbolic and political gesture.&lt;ref name=Bepler/&gt;&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt; While some of the books and manuscripts are now held by the [[University of Heidelberg]], the bulk of the original collection is now an integral part of the [[Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] at the Vatican.

==Foundation==
In the 1430s, Elector [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]] founded the ''Stiftsbibliothek'' in the [[Heiliggeistkirche]], which had good light for reading. This library formed the core of the Palatine Collection established by Elector [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine|Ottheinrich]] in the 1550s, together with the [[University Library Heidelberg]]. Essential manuscripts from the original Bibliotheca Palatina include the Carolingian "[[Lorsch Evangelary]]", the ''Falkenbuch'' (''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', cpl 1071, commissioned by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]), and the [[Codex Manesse]] (cpg 848)

Further important manuscripts were acquired from the collection of [[Ulrich Fugger]] (d. 1584), notably the illustrated [[Sachsenspiegel]] (cpg 164). [[Joseph Scaliger]] considered this '''Fugger Library''' superior to that owned by the Pope; the manuscripts alone were valued at 80,000 crowns, a very considerable sum in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;The ''Classical Journal'' for March and June 1816, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thirty Years War==
The Palatinate suffered heavily in the [[Thirty Years War]], and in 1622 Heidelberg was sacked by the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], whose general [[Count von Tilly]] was in the employ of [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]]. As book plundering was a source of both Catholic and Protestant cultural triumph during the Thirty Year's War, the occupiers jostled for control of the library.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt;

Maximilian originally wanted to add the ''Bibiliotheca Palatina'' to his own library in Munich. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] also sought it, sending counter-instructions to Tilly to keep it for his own collection in Vienna.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided/&gt; Although many books were [[book burning|torn]] or "dispersed among private hands"&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; during the sack, Pope [[Gregory XV]] convinced Maximilian  to present the remaining manuscripts to the Vatican  as "a sign of his loyalty and esteem"&lt;ref&gt;''Luther: Lectures on Romans'', ed. by Wilhelm Pauck. Westminster John Knox
Press, 1961. {{ISBN|0-664-24151-4}}. Page xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and to support his claim to the Palatinate's electoral title.&lt;ref name=HouseDivided&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Andrew L.|title=A House Divided: Wittelsbach Confessional Court Cultures in the Holy Roman Empire, C. 1550-1650|date=2010|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004183566|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations to secure transport the collection to Rome were supervised by the Greek scholar [[Leo Allatius]], sent to Heidelberg by the Vatican.

The Bibliotecha was a prominent prize captured during the Thirty Years' War. The victors were concerned not just with carrying away the collection and thus stripping the Calvinist party of one of its most important intellectual symbols; they also had wanted to eliminate all documentation of the library's provenance. The capture of the Palatine library was a carefully orchestrated symbolic act of looting in the Thirty Years' War, and triggered further acts of similar confiscations throughout the course of the hostilities.&lt;ref name=Bepler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bepler|first1=J|title=Vicissitudo Temporum: Some Sidelights on Book Collecting in the Thirty Years War|journal=Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=32|number=4|jstor=3648986|doi=10.2307/3648986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, as of 1623, the entire remaining library had been incorporated into the [[Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]], with each volume preserving, as a memorial, a leaf with the [[Wittelsbach]] arms.

By the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797), the Pope ceded 37 manuscripts to the [[French Republic]], which had them deposited in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]].  After the [[Vienna Congress|Congress of Vienna]] in 1814&amp;ndash;1815 decreed "the general restoration [or return] of works of art, of which the French had robbed other countries,"&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt; the contested manuscripts were conveyed from Paris to Heidelberg, rather than to Rome.{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=Which contested MSs? Said most were in Vatican.}}  In 1816, [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Prince Hardenberg]] and [[Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg]] persuaded [[Pope Pius VII]] to make a gift of 852 manuscripts, mostly in German, to the [[University of Heidelberg]].

For the University Jubilee, some other books were temporarily brought back from the Vatican and were displayed at the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Heiliggeistkirche]] in  1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3590">In [[biology]], '''biological specificity''' is the tendency of a characteristic such as a [[behavior]] or a [[biochemical]] variation to occur in a particular [[species]]. 

Biochemist [[Linus Pauling]] stated that "Biological specificity is the set of characteristics of living organisms or constituents of living organisms of being special or doing something special. Each animal or plant species is special. It differs in some way from all other species... biological specificity is the major problem about understanding life."&lt;ref name="Pauling"&gt;[[Linus Pauling]], Barbara Marinacci, ''Linus Pauling in His Own Words: Selections From His Writings, Speeches and Interviews'', (1995), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtopics==
Characteristics may further be described as being '''interspecific''', '''intraspecific''', and '''conspecific'''.
===Interspecific===
'''Interspecificity''' (literally ''between/among species''), or being '''interspecific''', describes issues between individuals of separate [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Interspecies communication]], communication between different species of animals, plants, fungi or bacteria
* [[Interspecific competition]], when individuals of different species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Interspecific feeding]], when adults of one species feed the young of another species
* [[Interspecific hybrid]]ization
* [[Biological interaction|Interspecific interaction]], the effects organisms in a community have on one another
* [[Interspecific pregnancy]], pregnancy involving an embryo or fetus belonging to another species than the carrier
===Intraspecific===
'''Intraspecificity''' (literally ''within species''), or being '''intraspecific''', describes behaviors, [[biochemical]] variations and other issues within individuals of a single [[species]]. These may include:
* [[Intraspecific antagonism]], when individuals of the same species are hostile to one another
* [[Intraspecific competition]], when individuals or groups of individuals from the same species compete for the same resource in an ecosystem
* [[Intraspecific hybrid|Intraspecific hybridization]]
* [[Intraspecific mimicry]]
===Conspecific===
{{Anchor|conspecificdefinition}}Two or more individual [[organism]]s, [[population]]s, or [[taxa]] are '''conspecific''' if they belong to the same [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Conspecificity|title=Conspecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where different species can interbreed and their gametes compete, the conspecific gametes take precedence over heterospecific gametes. This is known as conspecific [[sperm precedence]], or conspecific pollen precedence in plants.
===Heterospecific===
The [[antonym]] of conspecificity is the term '''heterospecificity''': two individuals are heterospecific if they are considered to belong to different biological species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Heterospecificity|title=Heterospecificity|publisher=Biology online|accessdate= 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">The '''Blytt-Sernander''' classification, or sequence, is a series of north [[Europe]]an climatic periods or phases based on the study of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[peat bog]]s by [[Axel Blytt]] (1876) and [[Rutger Sernander]] (1908). The classification was incorporated into a sequence of [[pollen zone]]s later defined by [[Lennart von Post]], one of the founders of [[palynology]].

==Description==
Layers in [[peat]] were first noticed by [[Heinrich Dau]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, ''Allerunterthänigster Bericht an die Königliche Dänische Rentekammer über die Torfmoore Seelands nach einer im Herbste 1828 deshalb unternommenen Reise.'' (usually simply ''Über die Torfmoore Seelands'') Copenhagen and Leipzig, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; A prize was offered by the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] to anyone who could explain them. Blytt hypothesized that the darker layers were deposited in drier times; the lighter, in moister times, applying his terms ''Atlantic'' (warm, moist) and ''Boreal'' (cool, dry). In 1926 [[C.A. Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;Weber, "Grenzhorizont und Klimaschwankungen" ''Abhandl. Naturwiss. Vereins, Bremen''  '''26''' (1926:98-106).&lt;/ref&gt; noticed the sharp boundary horizons, or ''Grenzhorizonte'', in [[Germany|German]] peat, which matched Blytt’s classification. Sernander defined subboreal and subatlantic periods, as well as the late glacial periods. Other scientists have since added other information.

The classification was devised before the development of more accurate dating methods, such as [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14 dating]] and [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s. Currently geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs and [[ice core]] samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt-Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].

The fluctuations of climatic change are more complex than Blytt-Sernander periodizations can identify. For example, recent peat [[core sample]]s at [[Roskilde Fjord]] and also [[Lake Kornerup]] in [[Denmark]] identified 40 to 62 distinguishable layers of [[pollen]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, no universally accepted replacement model has been proposed.

==Problems==

===Dating and calibration===
Today the Blytt-Sernander sequence has been substantiated by a wide variety of scientific dating methods, mainly [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates obtained from peat. Earlier radiocarbon dates were often left uncalibrated; that is, they were derived by assuming a constant concentration of atmospheric radiocarbon. In fact the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration has varied over time and thus radiocarbon dates need to be [[Radiocarbon dating|calibrated]].

===Cross-discipline correlation===
The Blytt-Sernander classification has been used as a temporal framework for the [[archaeology|archaeological cultures]] of [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. Some have gone so far as to identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There is no reason, for example, why the north [[Europe]]ans should stop using [[bronze]] and start using [[iron]] abruptly at the lower boundary of the [[Subatlantic]] at 600 BC. In the warm [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] period, [[Denmark]] was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] cultures, rather than [[Neolithic]], notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.

==Sequence==
The [[Pleistocene]] phases and approximate calibrated dates (see above) are:
* [[Older Dryas]] stadial, 14,000–13,600 BP ([[Before Present]])
* [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] interstadial, 13,600–12,900 BP
* [[Younger Dryas]] stadial, 12,900–11,640 BP

The [[Holocene]] phases are:
* [[Preboreal]]
* [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]], cool, dry, rising temperature, 11,500–8,900 BP
* [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]], warm, moist, maximum temperature, 8900–5700 BP
* [[Subboreal]], 5700–2600 BP
* [[Subatlantic]], 2600–0 BP

==Marker species==
Some marker plant [[genus|genera]]/[[species]] studied in [[peat]] are
*''[[Sphagnum]]''
*''[[Carex limosa]]''
*''[[Scheuchzeria palustris]]'', Rannock rush
*''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]'', cotton grass
*''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'', bog cranberry
*''[[Andromeda polifolia]]'', bog rosemary
*''[[Erica tetralix]]'', cross-leaved heather
*''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'', heather
*''[[Pine|Pinus]]'', pine
*''[[Birch|Betula]]'', birch

More [[sphagnum]] appears in wet periods. Dry periods feature more tree stumps, of birch and pine.

'''Building restoration''' describes a particular treatment approach and philosophy within the field of [[architectural conservation]].

According to the U.S. ''Secretary of Interior's standards'', "Restoration is said as the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10|df=}} Updated 12/113/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States restoration is different from preservation (American English, ''conservation'' in British English) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.

==Overview==
[[File:Valletta Großmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]
In the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)

Since Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.

Exterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.

==Secretary of Interiors standards for restoration==

In the United States, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] is the head of the [[National Park Service]] which owns and maintains thousands of historic buildings and has been a leader in historic preservation for over 100 years. The standards were developed in 1975 and updated in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David E.. ''Guidelines for the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards in housing''. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1995. 18-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards deal with the "...materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122165718/http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |archivedate=2013-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of historic buildings and are divided into preservation, rehabilitating, restoration and reconstruction. It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:
* '''Preservation''' "places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair." All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.
* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.
* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.
* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.

The first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to "...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials." which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.

==Storm Restoration==

Storm restoration is the restoring of a building due to damage from a severe storm. Most damage is caused by strong wind gusts or hail, but may also include large amounts of rainfall, lightning strikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored chapel|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110733/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|archivedate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as extreme storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes. The majority of storm damage occurs on roofs, sides of structures, and in basements, but over time causes damage to the interior. Unlike heritage restoration, storm restoration takes place on buildings with no historic significance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uasrc.org/|title=United Association of Storm Restoration Contractors|first=Jacob|last=Sachs|website=uasrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was published in March 2011 in the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' by [[Richard B. Hoover]], an engineer. However, NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claim and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry | last = Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
Hoover's team used Environmental ([[ESEM]]) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy ([[FESEM]]) to analyze the meteorite samples, studying internal surfaces. Hoover also produced  electron micrographs which he believes resemble the shape of [[trichomic]] [[cyanobacteria]] and other trichomic [[prokaryotes]] such as the [[filamentous sulfur bacteria]]. For comparison, Hoover compared the samples to those of terrestrial minerals and biological materials. Hoover concludes from these results that the CI1 fossils are indigenous to the samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year= 2011 | volume=  13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites:  Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. |last=Hoover| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims were initially submitted to the ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]'', which rejected the paper,&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt; but were eventually published by the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]''. NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claims,&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;

In [[human anatomy]], the '''cephalic  vein''' &lt;ref name=HealthlineBasilic&gt;{{cite web|title=BodyMaps: Median basilic vein|url=http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/median-basilic-vein|publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[superficial vein]] in the arm.

It communicates with the [[basilic vein]] via the [[median cubital vein]] at the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] and is located in the superficial [[fascia]] along the anterolateral surface of the [[biceps brachii muscle]].

Near the shoulder, the cephalic vein passes between the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] and [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] [[muscle]]s ([[deltopectoral groove]]) and through the [[deltopectoral triangle]], where it empties into the [[axillary vein]].

== Clinical significance ==
The cephalic vein is often visible through the [[skin]], and its location in the deltopectoral groove is fairly consistent, making this site a good candidate for venous access. [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|Permanent pacemaker]] leads are often placed in the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral groove. The vein may be used for [[intravenous therapy|intravenous access]], as large bore [[cannula]] may be easily placed.&lt;ref name="HealthlineCephalic"&gt;{{cite web|title=BodyMaps: Cephalic vein|url=http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/cephalic-vein|publisher=Healthline Networks, Inc|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cannulation of a vein as close to the radial nerve as the cephalic vein can sometimes lead to nerve damage.&lt;ref name="HealthlineCephalic" /&gt;

==History==
Ordinarily the term ''[[cephalic]]'' refers to anatomy of the head. When Persian physician [[Ibn Sīnā]]'s [[The Canon of Medicine|Canon]] was translated into [[medieval Latin]], ''cephalic'' was mistakenly chosen to render the [[Arabic]] term ''al-kífal'', meaning "outer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diab|first=Mohammad|title=Lexicon of orthopaedic etymology|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-90-5702-597-6|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Rand|title=Etymology of shoulder and arm terms|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/resources/etymology/Shoulder_arm.htm|publisher=© O'Rahilly 2008|location=Dartmouth Medical School|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clothed male, naked female''' ('''CMNF'''), or '''clothed male, nude female''', is female [[nudity]] in which one or more women are nude while one or more men are clothed. 

==In media==
Entertainment columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] details several experiences involving one-sided female nudity in his book ''Show Business Laid Bare.''&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business Laid Bare'', by Earl Wilson, {{ISBN|0-399-11276-6}}, New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1974. Second Printing&lt;/ref&gt;  In the chapter titled "Cheri Caffaro: A Strange Interlewd," Wilson writes about his experience interviewing actress [[Cheri Caffaro]] while she was nude and he was fully dressed.&lt;ref&gt;The story can be found on pages 45-56 of the hardcover second printing of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theme in art==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

One-sided female nudity has been a theme in art, particularly in [[orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the 19th century. A typical scene may be a depiction of [[sexual slavery|white slavery]] in which one or several nude female slaves are displayed before an audience of men at a [[slave market]]. The archetypal example of this type of scene is [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s ''[[The Slave Market (Gérôme painting)|The Slave Market]]'', in which a nude female slave is examined by a potential buyer. Another example is Gérôme's ''[[Phryne before the Areopagus|Phryné devant l'Areopage]]'' (''Phryne before the [[Areopagus]]'', 1861) which was based on the trial of [[Phryne]] before the Areopagus in ancient Greece. The [[odalisque]] (harem scene) was also a popular subject for depicting one-sided female nudity, although the clothed figures in the scene were not always male.

Outside of the Orientalist style, a scenario for one-sided female nudity in 19th-century art was the knight-errant, in which the [[damsel in distress]] was used to explore the erotic subtext of the powerful knight coming to the rescue of a helpless woman. The best known example of this is John Everett Millais' painting ''[[Knight Errant]]'', in which a nude woman has been tied to a tree and a knight is shown cutting her loose.

Another example is [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' ("The Luncheon on the Grass"), in which a nude woman is depicted having lunch with two fully clothed men. The ''[[Concert Champêtre (Titian)|Pastoral Concert]]'' (c. 1510) attributed to [[Giorgione]] or his pupil [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en From the Louvre Museum Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628061654/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting.

A 1913 painting ''Adoration'' by [[William Strang]] presents a philosophical study of beauty, with the clothed soldier, painter, scholar, and elderly gentleman fascinated by the naked female subject.

In [[music notation]], '''Dal segno''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|æ|l|_|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|j|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ɑː|l|_|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|j|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|dal ˈseɲɲo|lang}}), often abbreviated as '''D.S.''', is used as a navigation marker. From [[Italian language|Italian]] for "from the sign", D.S. appears in [[sheet music]] and instructs a musician to repeat a passage starting from the sign shown at right, sometimes called the ''segno'' in English.&lt;ref&gt;Percy Scholes (1970) ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', 10th edition, Oxford University Press, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common variants:
*'''D.S. al coda''' instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and when ''Al coda'' or ''To coda'' is reached jump to the [[coda (music)|coda]] symbol.
*'''D.S. al fine''' instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and end the piece at the measure marked ''fine''.
{{Quote|The Italian term 'dal segno' literally means 'from the sign.' In most music you will see either D.S. al Fine (which means 'go back to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign and play the music again until you come to the bar marked Fine, then stop') or D.S. al Coda (which means 'go back to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign and play the music again until you come to the bar marked To Coda, then jump to the coda'). ...You may also see simply...D.S. in the final bar of a score, which means to repeat from...the &amp;#x1D10B; sign...then stop at the end. In music, these instructions always appear at the end of the bar from which you have to jump back (either to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign or to the start of the piece).&lt;ref&gt;Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). "[[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 Reference"&lt;!--Sibelius Reference.pdf--&gt;, p.269. Edition 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Al segno''' indicates that the player should go to the sign. '''Da capo al segno''' ('''D.C. al Segno'''), "From the beginning to the sign (&amp;#x1D10B;)."&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22da+capo%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_Mnopd3UAhVB7GMKHYTxCfwQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22da%20capo%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.133. Novello. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In operas of the 18th century, dal segno [[aria]]s were a common alternative to [[da capo aria]]s which began with an opening [[ritornello]], which was then omitted in the repeat (the sign being placed after the ritornello).

==Encoding==
The ''Segno'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10B MUSICAL SYMBOL SEGNO:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D10B;

A '''dumbwaiter''' is a small freight [[elevator]] or lift intended to carry objects rather than people.  Dumbwaiters found within modern structures, including both commercial, public and private buildings, are often connected between multiple floors.  When installed in restaurants, schools, hospitals, retirement homes or in private homes, the lifts generally terminate in a kitchen.&lt;ref name=Strakosch&gt;{{cite book|author=George R.

The term seems to have been popularized in the United States in the 1840s, after the model of earlier "dumbwaiters" now known as [[serving tray]]s and [[lazy Susan]]s.&lt;ref name=quim&gt;[[Quinion, Michael]].

==Description==

A simple dumbwaiter is a movable frame in a shaft, dropped by a rope on a pulley, guided by rails; most dumbwaiters have a shaft, cart, and capacity smaller than those of passenger elevators, usually 45 to 450&amp;nbsp;kg (100 to 992&amp;nbsp;lbs.)&lt;ref name=CullmerBauer/&gt; Before electric motors were added in the 1920s, dumbwaiters were controlled manually by ropes on pulleys.&lt;ref name=Strakosch/&gt;

Early 20th-century building codes sometimes required fireproof dumbwaiter walls and self-closing fireproof doors and mention features such as buttons to control movement between floors and locks on doors preventing them from opening unless the cart is stopped at that floor.&lt;ref name=Avillo&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Avillo|title=Fireground Strategies|publisher=Tulsa: PennWell Books, 2002|isbn=978-0-87814-840-0|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dumbwaiter Lifts in London were extremely popular in the houses of the rich and privileged. Maids would use them to deliver laundry to the laundry room from different rooms in the house. This obviated carrying handfuls of dirty washing through the house, saving time and preventing injury.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tower-lifts.co.uk/goods-lifts/dumbwaiter-lifts/&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal complaint about a Manhattan restaurant's dumbwaiter in 1915, which also mentions that food orders are shouted up and down the shaft, describes its operation and limitations as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[There is] ... great play between the cart of the dumb-waiter and the guides on which it runs, with the result that the running of the cart is accompanied by a loud noise. The rope which operates the cart of the dumb-waiter runs in a wheel with a very shallow groove, so that the rope is liable to and does at times slip off. ... The cart has no shock absorbers at the top, so that when it strikes the top of the shaft or wheel there is a loud report. ... [T]he ropes of the dumb-waiter strike such wall at frequent intervals with a loud report. ... [T]he dumb-waiter is often negligently operated, by running it faster than necessary, and by letting it go down with a sudden fall.&lt;ref name=NYSupplement&gt;{{cite journal|title=DARR V.

More recent dumbwaiters can be more sophisticated, using electric motors, automatic control systems, and custom freight containers of other kinds of elevators.&lt;ref&gt;http://acelifts.com/dumbwaiter-lifts/&lt;/ref&gt; Recently constructed book [[Elevator|lift]]s in libraries and mail or other freight transports in office towers may be larger than many dumbwaiters in public restaurants and private homes, supporting loads as heavy as 450&amp;nbsp;kg (992&amp;nbsp;lbs).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Regulations governing construction and operation==
Building codes have regulated the construction and operation of dumbwaiters in parts of North America since the 19th century.&lt;ref name=CullmerBauer/&gt; Modern dumbwaiters in the United States and Canada must comply{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} with [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]] codes and, therefore, have features similar to those of passenger elevators.&lt;ref name=ASMECat1&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://catalog.asme.org/home.cfm?CATEGORY=CS&amp;TaxonomyItemID=2990&amp;ProductFormat=DigitalBook|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226184724/http://catalog.asme.org/home.cfm?CATEGORY=CS&amp;TaxonomyItemID=2990&amp;ProductFormat=DigitalBook|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-12-26|title=ASME Product Catalogue|publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]]|accessdate=2008-08-26}} [[ASME]] A17.1 covers safety for new elevators; A17.2, elevator inspection; A17.3, safety for existing elevators; and A17.4, emergency procedures, including those applying to modern dumbwaiters.&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction, operation and usage of dumbwaiters varies widely according to country.

==In history==

After defecting from the Soviet underground in 1938, [[Whittaker Chambers]] gave a last stash of stolen documents to his nephew-in-law, [[Nathan Levine]], who hid them in a dumbwaiter on his mother's house in Brooklyn.  A decade later, Chambers asked his nephew to retrieve them (which Chambers referred to as his "life preserver").  Handwritten and typewritten papers therein came from [[Alger Hiss]] and [[Harry Dexter White]] (and became known as the "Baltimore Documents").  Microfilm contained therein was subpoenaed and sensationalized (misnamed the "Pumpkin Papers" in the press) by  [[Richard M Nixon]] for [[HUAC]].&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;

==In culture==

[[Harold Pinter]] wrote a play in 1960 called ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'', in which a dumbwaiter forms a key element.

In the 2005 movie ''[[Zathura: A Space Adventure]]'', Danny uses his home's dumbwaiter to hide from his brother, and later to move around the house without being seen by the Zorgons.

In [[Littlest Pet Shop (2012 TV series)|Littlest Pet Shop]], Blythe uses a dumbwaiter to get to the Littlest Pet Shop building and back (sometimes, the pets also use the dumbwaiter).

In the 2018 film ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'', Maisie Lockwood uses her family mansion's dumbwaiter to hide from the antagonist Eli Mills and later the hybrid dinosaur the ''Indoraptor''. She also uses it to travel to its subbasement laboratory, where she meets Owen Grady and Claire Dearing.

'''Eco-sufficiency''' requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste (among which [[GHG emissions]]) in absolute terms.

This goes beyond the goal of increasing [[eco-efficiency]], which focuses on increasing output per unit of input to foster [[Eco-economic_decoupling|decoupling]]. Given a very loose relation in rich countries between [[GDP]] and human well-being, pursuing eco-sufficiency may be possible without reducing the latter by, for example, increasing leisure and communal activities.

== History ==

In 1993, [[Wolfgang Sachs]] summarised sufficiency with "four Ds"&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Sachs]], "Die vier E’s: Merkposten für einen maßvollen Wirtschaftsstil", ''Politische Ökologie'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Decelerate (going slower and less far);
* De-clutter (accumulate fewer things);
* Decentralize (choosing local and regional) ;
* Decommercialization (leaving less room for the [[Market economy|market]] in your life).

== Description and examples ==

There are potentials to substantially reduce the use of [[natural resources]] without compromising human wealth. However, many studies show that [[economic growth]] “eats up” these gains at least partially; if the economy grows by 2% per annum, we need an increase in [[resource productivity]] of 4% in order to achieve a 2% reduction in absolute resource use. While [[eco-efficiency]] aims to improve the effectiveness of material, energy, and land use, eco-sufficiency aims at reducing negative environmental consequences through a reduction of the demand for consumer goods.

Eco-sufficiency is closely to related  issues of [[quality of life]] and [[work-life balance]]. It can to some extent be achieved on the individual level, e.g. through energy savings, reduction of transport and change in diets (less meat). However, it also requires a change in social frameworks, provided on the national or European level, including measures such as [[ecotax|environmental tax]]es, [[environmental planning]] and new concepts of labour.

Eco-sufficiency is largely associated with the idea of altruism – the sober lifestyle adopted by its advocates is a manifestation of their concern for the well-being of future generations – and thus to date is endorsed by only a small minority of members of industrialised societies. A wide spread of eco-sufficiency will only occur, if people find the new lifestyles sufficiently attractive. It needs to be shown that less material wealth can bring increased well-being or [[happiness]] to individuals and societies. For example, it has been shown that downsizing or relocating consumers can be motivated by purely selfish reasons such as improving one’s health, avoiding stress, the nostalgia for a “good old time” and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index1022.html Boulanger, P.M. (2010) “Three strategies for sustainable consumption”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''3''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An important aspect here is related to the so-called work-and-spend cycle. If [[leisure]] and forms of work other than [[employment]] (incl. [[self-employment]]), such as caring, [[do it yourself]] and community work gain relevance, income - and therefore consumption - would be reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">'''Electromagnetic formation flight''' ('''EMFF''') investigates the concept of using [[electromagnet]]s coupled with reaction wheels in place of more traditional propulsion systems to control the positions and attitudes of a number of spacecraft in close proximity.  Unlike traditional propulsion systems, which use exhaustible propellants that often limit lifetime, the EMFF system uses solar power to energize a magnetic field. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Space Systems Laboratory is exploring this concept by developing dynamics and control models as well as an experimental testbed for their validation.

==How it works==

The magnetic fields for EMFF are generated by sending current through coils of wire.  The interaction between the magnetic dipoles created is easily understood with a far field approximation where the separation distance between two vehicles is large compared to the physical size of the dipole.  By controlling the dipoles on various vehicles, attraction, repulsion, and shear forces can be created. Combined with reaction wheels, any desired maneuver can be performed as long as the formation’s center of mass is not required to change.

==Applications==
The EMFF system is most applicable in cases where multiple spacecraft are free-flying relative to one another and there is no need to control the center of mass of the system. NASA’s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) mission and space telescope assembly are just two such types of missions.  EMFF provides the foremost advantage of reduced dependence on consumables.&lt;ref&gt;Kong, E. M. C., Kwon, D. W., Schweighart, S. A., Elias, L. M., Sedwick, R. J., Miller, D. W., “Electromagnetic Formation Flight for Multisatellite Arrays,” ''AIAA Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets'', Vol. 41, No. 4, p. 659-666, July–August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Kwon, '' Electromagnetic Formation Flight of Satellite Arrays '', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SERC #02-05, chap. 5, June 2005, available [http://ssl.mit.edu/publications/theses/SM-2005-KwonDaniel.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it eliminates thruster plumes and enhances the capability of replacing a failed element more economically.

==Testbed==
The MIT-SSL constructed two EMFF testbed vehicles for demonstrating control of 2-D formations on a large flat floor.  Vehicles are suspended on a frictionless air carriage and are completely self-contained using RF communications, microprocessors, and a metrology system.  Liquid Nitrogen maintains cryogenic temperatures and batteries provide the power to the [[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductive]] (HTS) coils.  The testbed has demonstrated control of the relative [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] (DOF) in open loop and closed loop control using linearized controllers and a nonlinear sliding mode controller.

==Awards==
Former Space Systems Lab associate director Dr. Raymond Sedwick (now at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]) has been awarded the first Bepi Colombo Prize for a paper on electromagnetic formation flight. According to Aero-Astro Professor Manuel Martinez-Sanchez, who worked with Colombo and was a juror in the competition, "The jury was unanimous in that Ray's paper best represented 'Bepi' Colombo's spirit of innovation and originality, combined with rigor."

'''Emerin''' is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ''EMD'' gene, also known as the ''STA'' gene. Emerin, together with [[LEMD3]], is a LEM domain-containing [[Transmembrane protein|integral]] [[protein]] of the [[Inner nuclear membrane proteins|inner]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] membrane in vertebrates. Emerin is highly expressed in [[cardiac muscle|cardiac]] and [[skeletal muscle]]. In [[cardiac muscle]], emerin localizes to [[adherens junction]]s within [[intercalated disc]]s where it appears to function in mechanotransduction of cellular strain and in [[CTNNB1|beta-catenin]] signaling. Mutations in emerin cause [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive]] [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]], cardiac conduction abnormalities and [[dilated cardiomyopathy]].

It is named after [[Alan Emery]].&lt;ref name="HoMBRG"&gt;{{cite Q|Q29581774|pages=118-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Emerin is a [[serine]]-rich nuclear membrane protein and a member of the [[nuclear lamina]]-associated protein family. It mediates membrane anchorage to the [[cytoskeleton]]. [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]] is an X-linked inherited degenerative [[myopathy]] resulting from mutation in the ''EMD'' (also known clinically as ''STA'') [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: EMD emerin (Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy)| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=2010| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction, as emerin-deficient mouse [[fibroblasts]] failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lammerding|first1=J|last2=Hsiao|first2=J|last3=Schulze|first3=PC|last4=Kozlov|first4=S|last5=Stewart|first5=CL|last6=Lee|first6=RT|title=Abnormal nuclear shape and impaired mechanotransduction in emerin-deficient cells.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=29 August 2005|volume=170|issue=5|pages=781–91|pmid=16115958|doi=10.1083/jcb.200502148|pmc=2171355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[cardiac muscle]], emerin is also found complexed to [[CTNNB1|beta-catenin]] at [[adherens junction]]s of [[intercalated disc]]s, and [[cardiomyocyte]]s from hearts lacking emerin showed [[CTNNB1|beta-catenin]] redistribution as well as perturbed [[intercalated disc]] architecture and myocyte shape.

== Clinical significance ==

Mutations in emerin cause [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive]] [[Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]], which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons, elbows and post-cervical muscles; muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs; along with cardiac conduction defects that range from [[sinus bradycardia]], [[First-degree atrioventricular block|PR prolongation]] to complete [[heart block]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Emery AE | title = Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy - a 40 year retrospective | journal = Neuromuscular Disorders | volume = 10 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 228–32 | date = Jun 2000 | pmid = 10838246 | doi=10.1016/s0960-8966(00)00105-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these patients, immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues, including muscle, skin [[fibroblast]]s, and [[leukocyte]]s, however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In nearly all cases, mutations result in a complete deletion, or undetectable levels, of emerin [[protein]].

Moreover, recent research have found that the absence of functional emerin may decrease the infectivity of [[HIV-1]].

'''Environmental social science''' is the broad, [[transdisciplinary]] study of interrelations between humans and the natural environment. Environmental social scientists work within and between the fields of [[anthropology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; and also in the [[interdisciplinary]] fields of [[environmental studies]], [[human ecology]] and [[political ecology]], [[social epidemiology]], among others.

== Ideologies, fields and concepts ==

Ideologies, fields and concepts in environmental social science aim to convey environmental issues as intertwined in societal relations, institutions and human activities that continually shape the environment or are themselves shaped by the environment. For example, political ecology is based on the premise that the environment is not "A-political" therefore the way it is managed, who has access to the environment, how environmental resources are distributed are shaped through political structures, power relations, economic institutions and social processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paul Robbins, conveys this in his differentiation of "A-political verse political ecologies". According to Robbins political ecology places emphasis on identifying "broader systems rather than blaming proximate and local forces; between viewing ecological systems as power-laden rather than politically inert; and between taking an explicitly normative approach rather than one that claims the objectivity of disinterest".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13 - 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human environmental relations reverberate through "the system" &amp;nbsp;(politics, economics, power relations) moving through an entire web of human relations and structures that are intertwined in ecological relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical Introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, environmental social scientists stress human – environmental relationships. Another idea that has risen to prominence in environmental social science in light of this, is the idea of "environmental justice" which connects issues in the field of social justice with issues related to the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=120 - 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing environmental justice, the concepts emphasized by Shoreman-Ouimet and Kopnina include "equity equality, and rights issues in relation to both social and ecological actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, Newyork|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pans out in debates about environmental vulnerability and the unequal distribution of resources. Here lies the idea, that certain groups are made more vulnerable to "environmental burdens"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while others gain more access to "environmental benefits"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as defined in terms of environmental resources and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In further attempting to understand human - environmental relationships disciplines of environmental social science have begun to explore relationships between humans and non-humans, to understand how both interact with each other within the natural world. Ideas related to exploring human and animal interactions within the natural world, have become prominent in environmental ethics. Shoreman Ouimet and Kopnina define environment ethics as "a sub-discipline of philosophy that deals with the ethical problems surrounding the environment, in some cases providing ethical justification and moral motivation for the cause of environmental protection or for considerations of animal welfare".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has culminated in debates regarding environmental value and moral rights and who within the larger ecosystem should be assigned these rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Environmental ethics explores the dialectic between human and nature exploring how the human configuration of nature may in turn reshape humans, their relationships and their conditions. Ideas that have emerged from the questions seeking to examine this dialectic include those of "post-domesticity and domesticity".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology of Meat|last=Emel|last2=Neo|first=Jodey &amp; Harvey|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticity refers to societal dynamics produced in societies in which humans have daily contact with animals other than pets in contrast in post-domesticity people are quite distant from the animals they consume in referencing the ideas of Bulliet (2005) Emel and Neo convey that a distance from witnessing the processes that govern animal life including births, deaths while consuming animals as food, impacts people differently than if they were to be interacting continuously with animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They mention that post- domesticity may produce feelings of guilt however the continued distance between animal life brought by interacting with animals as a commodity may cause people to only distantly relate to them or think of them as packages in a store disassociating them from the life-cycles they embody.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore environmental science has paved the way to multiple concepts, ideas and paradigms that differ among each other but all seek to intertwine issues related to the environment with other fields and issues in the social sciences.

== Social epidemiology ==
Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=snippet&amp;q=social%20epidemiologist&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M. Maria|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195377903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports as the "conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/|title=Social Determinants of Health {{!}} CDC|date=2017-07-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European [[Ministerial Conference]] on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new [[urban planning]], [[health equity]], and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/housing/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Housing and Health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain environments' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. [[Epidemiology]] uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes the idea that the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors are all important factors to be considered, and health impact assessments (HIA) recommended by social epidemiologists working with environment social scientists are effectively making positive changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) worked with its members to compose the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) protocol in 2001 to ensure health impact assessments would be made with environmental assessments for policies relating to bettering the quality of life especially within low socioeconomic communities all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/network/who_role/en/index2.html|title=WHO {{!}} WHO activities in HIA|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the environment can create stressors that are factors (i.e. low quality housing in areas of high pollution) that limit the quality of life of millions of people globally, environmental social scientists work collaboratively with the data social epidemiologists investigate and provide to understand the relationship between health status and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=environment&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion''', briefly '''ESPON''', is a European funded programme under the objective of "European Territorial Cooperation" of the Cohesion Policy of the European Union. It is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund - [[Interreg]]. 

The mission of the programme is to support policy development in relation to the aim of territorial cohesion and a harmonious development of the [[Europe]]an territory. Firstly it provides comparable information, evidence, analyses and scenarios on territorial dynamics and secondly it reveals territorial capital and potentials for the development of regions and larger territories thus contributing to European competitiveness, territorial cooperation and a sustainable and balanced development.

The current ESPON 2020 Programme is carried through by 28 [[European Union]] Member States as well as [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Fuzzy classification''' is the process of grouping elements into a [[fuzzy set]]&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1965). Fuzzy sets. Information and Control (8), pp. 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[membership function]] is defined by the truth value of a fuzzy propositional function.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, H.-J. (2000). ''Practical Applications of Fuzzy Technologies''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier, A., Schindler, G., &amp; Werro, N. (2008). Fuzzy classification on relational databases. In M. Galindo (Hrsg.), Handbook of research on fuzzy information processing in databases (Bd. II, S. 586-614). Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Del Amo, A., Montero, J., &amp; Cutello, V. (1999). On the principles of fuzzy classification. Proc. 18th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conf, (S. 675 – 679).&lt;/ref&gt;

A fuzzy class ~C = { i | ~Π(i) } is defined as a fuzzy set ~C of individuals i satisfying a fuzzy classification predicate ~Π which is a fuzzy propositional function. The domain of the fuzzy class operator ~{ .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of fuzzy propositional functions ~PF, and the range is the fuzzy [[powerset]] (the set of fuzzy subsets) of this universe, ~P(U):

~{ .| .}∶V × ~PF ⟶ ~P(U)

A fuzzy propositional function is, analogous to,&lt;ref name="Russel 1919"&gt;Russel, B. (1919). ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., S. 155&lt;/ref&gt; an expression containing one or more variables, such that, when values are assigned to these variables, the expression becomes a fuzzy proposition in the sense of.&lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975"&gt;Zadeh, L. A. (1975). Calculus of fuzzy restrictions. In L. A. Zadeh, K.-S. Fu, K. Tanaka, &amp; M. Shimura (Hrsg.), Fuzzy sets and Their Applications to Cognitive and Decision Processes. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, fuzzy classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a ''fuzzy set''. A fuzzy classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its fuzzy classification predicate ~Π.

μ∶~PF × U ⟶ ~T

Here, ~T is the set of fuzzy truth values (the interval between zero and one). The fuzzy classification predicate ~Π corresponds to a fuzzy restriction "i is R" &lt;ref name="Zadeh 1975" /&gt; of U, where R is a fuzzy set defined by a truth function. The degree of membership of an individual i in the fuzzy class ~C is defined by the truth value of the corresponding fuzzy predicate.

μ~C(i):= τ(~Π(i))

==Classification==
Intuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.

A [[class logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Glubrecht, J.-M., Oberschelp, A., &amp; Todt, G. (1983). Klassenlogik. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich: Wissenschaftsverlag.&lt;/ref&gt; is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator { .| .}. A ''class''

C = { i | Π(i) }

is defined as a set C of individuals i satisfying a classification predicate Π which is a propositional function. The domain of the class operator { .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of propositional functions PF, and the range is the powerset of this universe P(U) that is, the set of possible subsets:

{ .| .} ∶V×PF⟶P(U)

Here is an explanation of the logical elements that constitute this definition:
* An individual is a real object of reference.
* A universe of discourse is the set of all possible individuals considered.
* A variable V:⟶R is a function which maps into a predefined range R without any given function arguments: a zero-place function.
* A propositional function is “an expression containing one or more undetermined constituents, such that, when values are assigned to these constituents, the expression becomes a proposition”.&lt;ref name="Russel 1919" /&gt;

In contrast, ''classification'' is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a set. A classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate Π.

μ∶PF × U ⟶ T

The membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership μ of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value τ of the classification predicate Π.

μC(i):=τ(Π(i))

In classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.

}}The term '''''choice theory''''' is the work of [[William Glasser]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in [[psychology]] and [[counselling]].

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour ([[choice]]s) are driven by five genetically driven needs, survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power.
Survival needs include
* food
* clothing
* shelter
* breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
and four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/[[love]]
* [[Power (sociology)|Power]]/significance/competence
* [[Liberty|Freedom]]/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a "Quality World". Glasser's idea of a "Quality World" restates the [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian idea of archetypes]] but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's "Quality World" and what [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable.

Our "Quality World" images are our role models of an individual's "perfect" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's "Quality World" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and [[icon]]s, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our "Quality World". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a "Comparing Place" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).

Behavior ("Total Behavior" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components:  [[acting]], [[thinking]], [[feeling]], and [[physiology]]. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology.

A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with people important to us: spouses, parents, [[children]], friends and [[colleague]]s.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as [[mental illness]]. Glasser believed that "pleasure" and "happiness" are related but are far from synonymous. [[Sex]], for example, is a "pleasure" but may well be divorced from a "satisfactory relationship" which is a precondition for lasting "[[happiness]]" in [[life]]. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the "new reality therapy". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation.

Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. [[Reality therapy]] is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

==The ten axioms==

# The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we can give another person is information.&lt;br /&gt;
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.&lt;br /&gt;
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.&lt;br /&gt;
# What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we do is behave.&lt;br /&gt;
# All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.choicetheory.com | title=Choice Theory Psychology, Reality Therapy, Lead Management, &amp; Quality Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In classroom management ==
William Glasser's choice theory begins:  behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to "help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it".&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"&gt;Charles, C.M. (2008). ''Building Classroom Discipline.'' (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life.&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"/&gt;

==Education==

Glasser was no supporter of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]]. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning.

A typical example of choice theory and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]], where students decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when, how, and where they will do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school and it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy.

Sudbury schools are based on the premise that students are personally responsible for their acts, in opposition to virtually all schools today that deny it. The denial is threefold: schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Thus, members of these schools learn democracy by experience, and enjoy the rights of individuals.

Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st Century, they adduce.

== Critiques ==

Glasser's theories and teachings have not gone without criticism. In a book review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v07n02/v07n0208.pdf Review of ''Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health''], Jackson, W. Clay.  2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; W. Clay Jackson writes, "Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR .282000.29|DSM-IV-TR]] is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings."

A [[hardware security module]] (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages [[digital keys]] for [[strong authentication]] and provides [[Secure cryptoprocessor|cryptoprocessing]].   These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to a [[computer]] or [[Server (computing)|network server]].

[[Hardware backdoor]]s are [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] in [[Computer hardware|hardware]]. Conceptionally related, a [[hardware Trojan]] (HT) is a malicious modification an [[electronic system]], particularly in the context an [[integrated circuit]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Further, an individual PUF device must be easy to make but practically impossible to duplicate, even given the exact manufacturing process that produced it. In this respect it is the hardware analog of a [[one-way function]].

In [[space exploration]], '''in situ resource utilization''' ('''ISRU''') is defined as ''"the collection, processing, storing and use of materials encountered in the course of human or robotic space exploration that replace materials that would otherwise be brought from Earth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sacksteder|first1=Kurt R.|last2=Sanders|first2=Gerald B.|title=In-situ resource utilization for lunar and mars exploration|journal=AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit|date=January 2007|volume=AIAA 2007-345|doi=10.2514/6.2007-345|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-345|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISRU is the practice of leveraging resources found or manufactured on other [[astronomical object]]s (the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc.) to fulfill or enhance the requirements and capabilities of a [[space mission]].

ISRU can provide materials for [[life support system|life support]], [[propellant]]s, [[construction material]]s, and energy to a spacecraft [[payload]]s or space exploration crews.
It is now very common for [[spacecraft]] and robotic planetary surface mission to harness the [[solar radiation]] found ''[[in situ]]'' in the form of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]]. The use of ISRU for material production has not yet been implemented in a space mission, though several field tests in the late 2000s demonstrated various lunar ISRU techniques in a relevant environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Integration of In-Situ Resource Utilization into lunar/Mars exploration through field analogs|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117710005788|journal = Advances in Space Research|date = 2011-01-04|pages = 20–29|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2010.08.020|first = Gerald B.|last = Sanders|first2 = William E.|last2 = Larson|bibcode = 2011AdSpR..47...20S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISRU has long been considered as a possible avenue for reducing the mass and cost of space exploration architectures, in that it may be a way to drastically reduce the amount of payload that must be launched from Earth in order to explore a given [[planetary body]].
According to [[NASA]], "in-situ resource utilisation will enable the affordable establishment of [[extraterrestrial exploration]] and operations by minimizing the materials carried from Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Uses==

=== Water ===
In the context of ISRU water is most often sought directly as fuel or as feedstock for fuel production. Applications include its use in life support either directly by drinking, for [[Space farming|growing food]], [[Electrolysis of water|producing oxygen]], or numerous other industrial processes. All of which require a ready supply of water in the environment and the equipment to extract it. Such [[extraterrestrial water]] has been discovered in a variety of forms throughout the solar system, and a number of potential water extraction technologies have been investigated. For water that is chemically bound to [[regolith]], solid ice, or some manner of permafrost, sufficient heating can recover the water. However this is not as easy as it appears because ice and permafrost can often be harder than plain rock, necessitating laborious mining operations. Where there is some level of atmosphere, such as on Mars, water can be extracted directly from the air using a simple process such as [[WAVAR]]. Another possible source of water is deep aquifers kept warm by Mars's latent geological heat, which can be tapped to provide both water and geothermal power.

=== Rocket propellant ===
Rocket propellant from [[water]] [[ice]] has also been proposed for the [[Moon]], mainly from [[lunar ice|ice that has been found at the poles]]. The likely difficulties include working at extremely low temperatures and extraction from the [[regolith]]. Most schemes [[Electrolysis of water|electrolyse the water]] and form [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and liquify and [[cryogenic]]ally store them. This requires large amounts of equipment and power to achieve. Alternatively it is possible to simply heat the water in a nuclear or solar [[thermal rocket]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/space98/ LSP water truck]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to give very much more [[mass]] delivered to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) in spite of the much lower [[specific impulse]], for a given amount of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/moonice1000/ steam rocket factor 1000]. Neofuel.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[monopropellant]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be made from water on [[Mars]] and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/Chapter%206.pdf|title=Chapter 6: Viking and the Resources of Mars (from a history of NASA)|publisher=NASA|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum]] as well as other metals have been proposed for use as rocket propellant made using lunar resources,&lt;ref name="Hepp" /&gt; and proposals include reacting the aluminum with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/24/nasa_alice_test/|title=New NASA rocket fuel 'could be made on Moon, Mars'|last=Page|first=Lewis|date=August 24, 2009|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Mars, methane propellant can be manufactured via the [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier]] process.

===Solar cell production===
It has long been suggested that [[solar cell]]s could be produced from the materials present in lunar soil. Silicon, aluminium, and glass, three of the primary materials required for solar cell production, are found in high concentrations in lunar soil and can be utilised to produce solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Materials refining on the Moon|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506004085|journal = Acta Astronautica|date = 2007-05-01|pages = 906–915|volume = 60|issue = 10–11|doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.11.004|first = Geoffrey A.|last = Landis|bibcode = 2007AcAau..60..906L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the native vacuum on the lunar surface provides an excellent environment for direct vacuum deposition of thin-film materials for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070018263.pdf|title = Process Demonstration For Lunar In Situ Resource Utilization—Molten Oxide Electrolysis|last = Curreri|first = Peter|date = 2006|journal = MSFC Independent Research and Development Project (No. 5–81), 2.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-09-27|last2 = Ethridge|first2 = E.C.|last3 = Hudson|first3 = S.B.|last4 = Miller|first4 = T.Y.|last5 = Grugel|first5 = R.N.|last6 = Sen|first6 = S.|last7 = Sadoway|first7 = Donald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface can be used to support lunar surface operations as well as satellites off the lunar surface. Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface may prove more cost effective than solar arrays produced and shipped from Earth, but this trade depends heavily on the location of the particular application in question.

Another potential application of lunar-derived solar arrays is providing power to Earth. In its original form, known as the [[solar power satellite]], the proposal was intended as an alternate power source for [[Earth]]. Solar cells would be shipped to Earth orbit and assembled, the power being transmitted to Earth via microwave beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite much work on the cost of such a venture, the uncertainty lay in the cost and complexity of fabrication procedures on the lunar surface.

===Metals for construction or return to Earth===
[[Asteroid mining]] could also involve extraction of metals for construction material in space, which may be more cost-effective than bringing such material up out of [[Earth]]'s deep gravity well, or that of any other large body like the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].  Metallic asteroids contain huge amounts of [[siderophile element|siderophilic metals]], including [[precious metal]]s.

===Building materials===
The colonisation of planets or moons will require obtaining local building materials, such as [[regolith]]. For example, studies employing artificial Mars soil mixed with [[epoxy resin]] and [[tetraethoxysilane]], produce high enough values of strength, resistance, and flexibility parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Polymeric composites on the basis of Martian ground for building future mars stations |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=April 2016 |last=Mukbaniani |first=O.

==Locations==

===Mars===
{{See also|Mars Direct}}
ISRU research for Mars is focused primarily on providing [[rocket propellant]] for a return trip to Earth&amp;nbsp;— either for a manned or a sample return mission&amp;nbsp;— or for use as fuel on Mars. Many of the proposed techniques utilise the well-characterised [[atmosphere of Mars]] as feedstock.  Since this can be easily simulated on Earth, these proposals are relatively simple to implement, though it is by no means certain that NASA or the ESA will favour this approach over a more conventional direct mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars Sample Return|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEM1PM808BE_0.html|publisher=www.esa.int|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical proposal for ISRU is the use of a [[Sabatier reaction]], {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}, in order to produce methane on the Martian surface, to be used as a propellant.  Oxygen is liberated from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the hydrogen recycled back into the Sabatier reaction.  The usefulness of this reaction is that—{{asof|2008|lc=on}}, when the availability of water on Mars was less scientifically demonstrated—only the hydrogen (which is light) was thought to need to be brought from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sizing of a Combined Sabatier Reaction and Water Electrolysis Plant for Use in In Situ Resource Utilization on Mars|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/jur/200109/papers/paper_canton.html|publisher=www.clas.ufl.edu|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, [[SpaceX]] is currently [[New product development|developing]]&lt;!-- development starts with design, as long as the project is funded; the SpaceX ITS system is a funded development project --&gt; the technology for a [[SpaceX Mars propellant plant|Mars propellant plant]] that will use a variation on what is described in the previous paragraph.  Rather than transporting hydrogen from Earth to use in making the methane and oxygen, they intend to mine the requisite water from subsurface [[ice|water ice]] that is now known to be abundant across much of the Martian surface, produce and then [[Liquefied natural gas|store]] the post-Sabatier reactants, and then use it as propellant for return flights of their ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' no earlier than 2023.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609&gt;

A similar reaction proposed for Mars is the reverse [[water gas shift reaction]],  {{nowrap|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}. This reaction takes place rapidly in the presence of an iron-chrome [[catalyst]] at 400 Celsius,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Again, oxygen is recycled from the water by [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and the reaction only needs a small amount of hydrogen from Earth.  The net result of this reaction is the production of oxygen, to be used as the oxidizer component of rocket fuel.

Another reaction proposed for the production of oxygen and fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2514/2.3739|title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Diane L.|last2=Linne|date=1 January 2001|publisher=|volume=38|issue=5|pages=730–735|accessdate=1 December 2016|via=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/2.3739|bibcode=2001JSpRo..38..730L}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the electrolysis of the atmospheric carbon dioxide,

More recently, it has been proposed the in situ production of oxygen, hydrogen and CO  from the  martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical {{CO2|link=yes}}/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process, and specifically in the magnetite/wustite redox cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Arias. 2016.  On the in situ production of oxygen and hydrogen from martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O splitting process. Journal of Space Colonization. Issue 5. ISSN 2053-1737&lt;/ref&gt;  Although thermolysis is the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules, it is neither practical nor efficient in the case of either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because the process requires a very high temperature (&gt; 2500 C) to achieve a meaningful dissociation fraction.&lt;ref&gt;Ermanoski, I., Siegel, N. P., and Stechel, E. B., A New Reactor Concept for Efficient Solar-Thermochemical Fuel Production," Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol. 135, No. 3, 2013, Paper 031002&lt;/ref&gt; This poses problems in finding suitable reactor materials, losses due to vigorous product recombination, and excessive aperture radiation losses when concentrated solar heat is used. The magnetite/wustite redox cycle was first proposed for solar application on earth by Nakamura,&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, T., \Hydrogen Production from Water Utilizing Solar Heat at High Temperatures, Solar Energy, Vol. 19, No. 5, 1977, pp. 467{475.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first used for solar-driven two-step water splitting. In this cycle, water reacts with wustite (FeO) to form magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen. The summarised reactions in this two-step splitting process are as follows:

: &lt;chem&gt;Fe3O4 -&gt;[energy] {3FeO} + \overbrace{1/2O2}^{\underset{(\operatorname{by-product})}{oxygen}}&lt;/chem&gt;.

and the obtained FeO is used for  the thermal splitting of water or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :

: {{nowrap|3FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{nowrap|3FeO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO}}

This process is repeated cyclically. The above process results in a substantial reduction in the thermal input of energy if compared with the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Roeb, M., Neises, M., Monnerie, N., Call, F., Simon, H., Sattler, C., Schmucker, M., and Pitz-Paal, R.,  Materials-Related Aspects of Thermochemical Water and Carbon Dioxide Splitting: A Review," Materials, Vol. 5, 2012, pp. 2015 2054.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process needs wustite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to start the cycle, but on Mars there is no wustite or at least not in significant amounts. Nevertheless,  wustite can be  easily obtained by reduction of hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)  which is an abundant material on Mars, being specially conspicuous the  strong hematite  deposits located at Terra Meridiani.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Hartmann. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars: The Mysterious Landscapes of the Red Planet. Workman Pub., 2003-Science&lt;/ref&gt;
The intention of wustite from the hematite -abundantly available on Mars, is an industrial  process well-known on earth, and us performed   by the following two main reduction reactions, namely:   
  
: {{nowrap|3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

It has been suggested that buildings on Mars could be made from [[basalt]] as it has good insulating properties.

===Moon===
[[Image:Footprint.gif|thumb|left|250px|Footprint in lunar [[regolith]].]]
The Moon possesses abundant raw materials that are potentially relevant to a hierarchy of future applications, beginning with the use of lunar materials to facilitate human activities on the [[Moon]] itself and progressing to the use of lunar resources to underpin a future industrial capability within the Earth-Moon system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Ian|date=2015|title=Lunar Resources: A Review|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|volume=39|pages=137–167|doi=10.1177/0309133314567585|arxiv = 1410.6865 |bibcode = 2015PrPG...39..137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lunar highland material [[anorthite]] can be used as [[aluminium]] [[ore]]. Smelters can produce pure aluminium, calcium metal, oxygen and silica glass from anorthite. Raw anorthite is also good for making fiberglass and other glass and ceramic products.&lt;ref name="mining"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxygen is often found in iron rich lunar minerals and glasses as [[iron oxide]]. The oxygen can be extracted by heating the material to temperatures above 900&amp;nbsp;°C and exposing it to hydrogen gas. The basic equation is: FeO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This process has recently been made much more practical by the discovery of significant amounts of [[hydrogen]]-containing [[regolith]] near the [[Moon#Presence of water|Moon's poles]] by the [[Clementine spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cast basalt is used on Earth for construction of, for example, pipes where a high resistance to abrasion is required. Cast basalt has a very high [[hardness]] of 8 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]] ([[diamond]] is 10 Mohs) but is also susceptible to mechanical impact and [[thermal shock]]&lt;ref&gt;

[[Glass]] and [[glass fiber]] are straightforward to process on the Moon and Mars, and it has been argued that the glass is optically superior to that made on the Earth because it can be made [[anhydrous]].&lt;ref name = "mining"/&gt; Successful tests have been performed on Earth using two [[lunar regolith simulant]]s [[MLS-1]] and [[MLS-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |title=Processing Glass Fiber from Moon/Mars Resources |first1=Dennis S. |last1=Tucker |first2=Edwin C. |last2=Ethridge |url=https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/1998/05/11/msad28apr98_1a_resources/fiber.pdf |date=May 11, 1998 |id=19990104338 |conference=Proceedings of American Society of Civil Engineers Conference, 26–30 April 1998 |location=Albuquerque, NM; United States | deadurl = yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000918225927/https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/space98pdf/fiber.pdf |archivedate=2000-09-18  }}&lt;!-- record: https://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19990104338 --&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; [[Basalt fibre]] has also been made from lunar regolith simulators.

===Martian moons, Ceres, asteroids===
Other proposals&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Zuppero and Geoffrey A. Landis, "Mass budget for mining the moons of Mars," ''Resources of Near-Earth Space,'' University of Arizona, 1991 (abstract here [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=49095&amp;id=2&amp;as=false&amp;or=false&amp;qs=Ntt%3Dzuppero%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ns%3DArchiveName%257c1%26N%3D4294808501] or here [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991rnes.nasa...24Z])&lt;/ref&gt; are based on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. These moons are in reasonably high orbits above Mars, have very low escape velocities, and unlike Mars have return [[delta-v budget|delta-v]]'s from their surfaces to [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]] which are less than the return from the Moon.

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is further out than Mars, with a higher delta-v, but launch windows and travel times are better, and the surface gravity is just 0.028 g, with a very low escape velocity of 510&amp;nbsp;m/s. Researchers have speculated that the interior configuration of Ceres includes a water-ice-rich mantle over a rocky core.&lt;ref name="Thomas2005"&gt;
{{cite journal | first=P.C | last=Thomas |author2=Parker J.Wm. |author3=McFadden, L.A. |display-authors= etal  | title=Differentiation of the asteroid Ceres as revealed by its shape | date=2005 | journal=Nature | volume=437 | pages=224–226 | doi=10.1038/nature03938 | bibcode=2005Natur.437..224T | pmid=16148926 | issue=7056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near Earth Asteroids]] and bodies in the [[asteroid]] belt could also be sources of raw materials for ISRU.

===Planetary atmospheres===
Proposals have been made for "mining" for [[rocket propulsion]], using what is called a [[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator]]. [[Atmospheric gas]]es like oxygen and [[argon]] could be extracted from the atmosphere of planets like the Earth, Mars, and the outer [[Gas Giants]] by [[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator]] satellites in low orbit.&lt;ref name=Jones2010&gt;

==ISRU capability classification (NASA)==
In October 2004, NASA’s Advanced Planning and Integration Office commissioned an ISRU capability roadmap team.
The team's report, along with those of 14 other capability roadmap teams, were published May 22, 2005.&lt;ref name=NCRES2005&gt;
{{cite web

  | pages = 264-291}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The report identifies seven ISRU capabilities:&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|278}}
(i) resource extraction, (ii) material handling and transport, (iii) resource processing, (iv) surface manufacturing with ''in situ'' resources, (v) surface construction, (vi) surface ISRU product and consumable storage and distribution, and (vii) ISRU unique development and certification capabilities. 

The report focuses on lunar and martian environments. It offers a detailed timeline&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|274}} and capability roadmap to 2040&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280-281}} but it assumes lunar landers in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref name=NCRES2005/&gt;{{rp|280}}

==ISRU technology demonstrators and prototypes==
The [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] was intended to carry to Mars a test payload, MIP (Mars ISPP Precursor), that was to demonstrate manufacture of [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere of Mars,&lt;ref name=Kaplan2001&gt;D. Kaplan ''et al.'', [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsmiss99/pdf/2503.pdf THE MARS IN-SITU-PROPELLANT-PRODUCTION PRECURSOR (MIP) FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION], paper presented at ''Mars 2001: Integrated Science in Preparation for Sample Return and Human Exploration'', Lunar and Planetary Institute, Oct. 2-4 1999, Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt; but the mission was cancelled.

The [[Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment]] (MOXIE) is a 1% scale prototype model aboard the planned [[Mars 2020]] rover that will produce [[oxygen]] from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide ([[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) in a process called [[Solid oxide electrolyser cell|solid oxide electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=techport&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA TechPort -- Mars OXygen ISRU Experiment Project|url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/33080|website=NASA TechPort|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=http://www.space.com/26705-nasa-2020-rover-mars-colony-tech.html |title=Oxygen-Generating Mars Rover to Bring Colonization Closer |work=Space.com |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GFSC&gt;[https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/Final/PDF/ThursPM.pdf The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE)] PDF.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5337">'''Inter-protocol exploitation''' is a class of [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] that takes advantage of interactions between two communication [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/papers/InterProtocolCommunication.pdf|title=Inter-protocol Communication|date= Aug 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the protocols used in the [[Internet]]. It is commonly discussed in the context of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] ([[HTTP]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remote.org/jochen/sec/hfpa/index.html|title=HTML Form Protocol Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Exploit (computer security)|attack]] uses the potential of the two different protocols meaningfully communicating commands and data.

It was popularized in 2007 and publicly described in research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/Libraries/Documents/03_07_Inter-Protocol_Exploitation.sflb.ashx|title=Inter-protocol Exploitation|date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same year. The general class of attacks that it refers to has been known since at least 1994 (see the Security Considerations section of RFC 1738).

[[Internet protocol]] implementations allow for the possibility of encapsulating [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit code]] to compromise a remote program which uses a different protocol. Inter-protocol exploitation can utilize inter-protocol communication to establish the preconditions for launching an inter-protocol exploit. For example, this process could negotiate the initial authentication communication for a vulnerability in password parsing. Inter-protocol exploitation is where one protocol attacks a service running a different protocol. This is a legacy problem because the specifications of the protocols did not take into consideration an attack of this type.

==Technical details==
The two protocols involved in the vulnerability are termed the carrier and target. The carrier [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulates]] the commands and/or data. The target protocol is used for communication to the intended victim service. Inter-protocol communication will be successful if the carrier [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] can encapsulate the commands and/or data sufficiently to meaningfully communicate to the target [[Service (systems architecture)|service]].

Two preconditions need to be met for successful communication across protocols: encapsulation and error tolerance. The carrier protocol must encapsulate the data and commands in a manner that the target protocol can understand. It is highly likely that the resulting [[data stream]] with induce [[parsing]] errors in the target protocol.

The target protocol be must be sufficiently [[error tolerance|forgiving of errors]]. During the inter-protocol connection it is likely that a percentage of the communication will be invalid and cause errors. To meet this precondition, the target protocol implementation must continue processing despite these errors.

==Current implications==
One of the major points of concern is the potential for this attack vector to reach through [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Demilitarized zone (computing)|DMZ]]s. Inter-protocol exploits can be transmitted over [[HTTP]] and launched from [[web browsers]] on an internal [[subnetwork|subnet]]. An important point is the web browser is not exploited through any conventional means.

==Example==
JavaScript delivered over HTTP and communicating over the IRC protocol.

The '''internal consistency of the Bible''' concerns the coherence and textual integrity of the [[Bible]]. Disputes regarding biblical consistency have a long history.&lt;!--Summary evidences in article, no source needed!--&gt;

Classic texts that discuss questions of inconsistency from a critical secular perspective include the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' by [[Baruch Spinoza]], the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' of [[Voltaire]], the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' by [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paine | first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Paine | title = Writings of Thomas Paine — Volume 4 (1794–1796): the Age of Reason by Paine | publisher = Project Gutenberg | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3743 | accessdate = 2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy}}
For many believers, the internal consistency of the Jewish and Christian scriptures is important because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin.{{cn|date=August 2018}} On the subject of the Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the [[Torah]] that "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the [[Hebrew Bible]] or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected [[rabbinic]] leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".&lt;ref&gt;Golding, JL., ''Rationality and Religious Theism'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p.106
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Christian evangelists [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Dillon Burroughs]] state that "the Bible's teachings, if perfect, must be consistent with one another" and that "the Bible is consistent with itself from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, J. and Burroughs, D., ''Taking a Stand for the Bible: Today's Leading Experts Answer Critical Questions about God's Word'', Harvest House Publishers, 2009, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Catholic writers have argued that "If we believe the Scriptures are divinely inspired, we must also believe them to be internally coherent".&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, S., and Mitch, C., ''Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon'', Ignatius Press, 2013, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor [[Erwin Lutzer]] argues that the Bible is consistent in asserting that it is the word of God, and that this is a reason for accepting that it is of divine origin: "The sixty-six books speak with a consistent voice that these are the words of God".&lt;ref&gt;Lutzer, EW., ''Seven Reasons Why You Can Trust the Bible'', Moody Publishers, 2008, pp. 16 &amp; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of traditional Jewish and Christian belief have also argued that inconsistencies undermine the value of scripture. The [[deist]] minister [[Joseph Barker (minister)|Joseph Barker]], speaking in 1854, described the Bible as "the most inconsistent, the most monstrous and blasphemous representations of God that can possibly be conceived by the human mind" and argued that "The book that contradicts science and contradicts itself is a book of no authority whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Hartford Bible Convention'', Partridge &amp; Brittan, 1854, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern Islamic critic writes that if the Bible can be shown to be inconsistent, "then those who preach the Bible and read the Bible must seriously reconsider their source of information concerning their faith."&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Abdul Mahaimin, ''Jesus and the Bible'', Islamic Books, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

One response to this kind of criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist. As theologian [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] explains, some Christians read the Bible with the assumption that "Scripture is ''self-consistent''", and that if there appear to be contradictions between two texts, they believe that "more careful reading is required to show that they really cohere". Barton states that "this is not the Bible that we have in fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" and "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J., ''The Bible: The Basics'', Routledge, 2010. pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christian writers, however, while agreeing that inaccuracies and inconsistencies occur, argue that these do not necessarily make the Bible false&lt;ref&gt;Giles, T., ''A Doubter's Guide to the Bible'', Abingdon Press, 2010, Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is no longer desirable to try to [[Gospel harmony|harmonize all four Gospels into "one consistent account"]], because "we have learned that each of the four Gospels has its own ... unique image of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Garvey, JD. and Garvey, SJ., ''Why a Church Catholic?'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randel Helms]] argues that the books of the Bible were written for and against different points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write because they wanted to challenge or correct those who had written before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Randel |authorlink= |title=The Bible Against Itself: Why the Bible Seems to Contradict Itself |accessdate= |year=2006  |publisher=Millennium Press |location= |isbn=0-9655047-5-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMqWPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Bible+against+itself&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV09XX-KTJAhXDGz4KHSukBcEQ6AEIHDAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{See also|Biblical inerrancy|Divine inspiration}}

===Jewish===
The [[Torah]] is viewed by some as the literal word of God, [[Mosaic authorship|dictated to Moses]]. According to the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]], "The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by God".&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11:1, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neviim|Prophets]], such as [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Jonah]], are said to have heard and reported the word of God,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Isaacs, RH., ''Messengers of God: A Jewish Prophets Who's who'', Jason Aronson, 1998, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Kethuvim|Writings]] (the category that includes books such as [[Psalms]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) "were excluded from the prophetic collection because their inspiration appeared to be human rather than Divine".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, pp. 577–578.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "In the broadest sense, the Scriptures taken as a whole, and subsequently the totality of Jewish spiritual teaching, fall within the connotation of God's word."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 21, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern Jewish scholars have an accommodating view of the nature of the Torah, not necessarily viewing it as strictly internally consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===
{{See also|Biblical inspiration}}
[[Justin Martyr]], a 2nd-century Christian writer, declared the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] generally preferred in the early Church, to be "completely free of errors".&lt;ref&gt;Hengel, M.,
The Septuagint as a Collection of Writings Claimed by Christians:
Justin and the Church Fathers before Origen, in Dunn, JDG., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C&amp;dq=%27%27JEWS+AND+CHRISTIANS+The+Parting+of+the+Ways&amp;q=septuagint+free+errors#v=snippet&amp;q=septuagint%20free%20errors&amp;f=false ''Jews and Christians''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote that "the author of Holy Scripture is God".&lt;ref&gt;"Quod auctor sacrae Scripturae est Deus". [[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/st_q1.html Article 10].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) asserts that the Bible's authority depends "wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], Chapter I, Paragraph iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches follow the Jewish practice of describing certain books as [[apocrypha]] (although not all churches regard the same list of books as apocryphal, see also [[biblical apocrypha]]).

Assertions that the Bible contains inconsistencies contradicts [[Martin Luther]]'s statement that "God cannot lie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissar37.htm |title="Lessons from Luther on the Inerrancy of Holy Writ" Luther, Martin. '&amp;#39;Weimarer Ausgabe'&amp;#39; 10 III, 162 |publisher=Mtio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther accepted that mistakes and inconsistencies existed, but concluded that they did not necessarily undermine the truth of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

German Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]] took a different view, proposing in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) a number of attempted [[Gospel harmony|harmonisations]], including the suggestion that Jesus must have been [[Crown of Thorns|crowned with thorns]] twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) p. 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christian approaches to biblical consistency are reminiscent of the split between Luther and Osiander, and can be broadly divided between [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] and [[biblical infallibility|infallibility]]. The former, followed by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and by [[evangelical Christians]] in the United States in general, holds that the original [[biblical manuscript]]s have "God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter", so that "all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp |title=The Baptist Faith and Message, I. The Scriptures |publisher=Sbc.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gleason Archer]], whose reconciliation of difficult texts echoes that of Osiander, allow that textual scholarship and an understanding of the historical context of individual passages is necessary to establish true, original biblical text, but that that text, once discovered, is without error.

The infallibility approach followed by some theologians and scholars, primarily of the Catholic and Anglican churches, and some mainline Protestant denominations, avoids many of the pitfalls of inerrancy by holding that the Bible is without error only in matters essential to salvation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration", 65:29–50, pp. 1029f}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that guidance is necessary for the correct interpretation of apparent inconsistencies; the latter part being common to all Orthodox and Catholic Christians, regardless of views of biblical inerrancy, being the primary role of the [[magisterium]].

According to Roman Catholic biblical scholar [[Raymond E. Brown]], this approach found expression in ''[[Dei verbum]]'', one of the key documents adopted at the [[Second Vatican Council]], which stated that scripture teaches "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm ''Dei verbum'', Chapter III, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that Scripture is [[biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] only "to the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God,"&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, ''The Critical Meaning of the Bible'', Paulist Press (1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent P. Branick, ''Understanding the New Testament and Its Message: An Introduction'', (Paulist Press, 1998), p. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; without necessarily being reliable on matters such as paleontology or political history; this view is challenged by some conservative Catholic scholars.&lt;ref name="JI"&gt;{{cite book|last=|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|year=1989|publisher=Pearson|pages=1023–1033|author=Raymond F Collins|edition=1st|editor=Raymond Brown |editor2=Joseph Fitzmyer |editor3=Roland Murphy (Eds.)|chapter=Essay 65: "Inspiration"|quote="Clearly, Vatican II intended to recapitulate traditional teaching on inspiration....In this regard, Vatican II's statement on inspiration concurs with the views of many evangelical Christians."

===Muslim===
In the Middle Ages, [[Ulema|Muslim scholars]] such as [[Ibn Hazm]], [[al-Qurtubi]], [[al-Maqrizi]], [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Izhar ul-Haqq]], Ch. 1 Sect. 4 titled ([[s:ar:إظهار الحق/القول في التوراة والإنجيل|القول في التوراة والإنجيل]]).&lt;/ref&gt; based on their interpretation of [[Quran]]ic and other traditions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s explication of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]'s&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] had tampered with the scriptures, a concept known as ''[[tahrif]]''.

The theme of ''tahrif'' was first explored in the writings of Ibn Hazm (10th century), who rejected claims of [[Mosaic authorship]] and posited that [[Ezra]] was the author of the Torah. His arguments against the authenticity of the biblical text in both the [[Tanakh]] and New Testament included chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; what he considered theological impossibilities ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] expressions, stories of [[extramarital sex]], and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as what he saw as a lack of reliable transmission (''[[tawatur]]'') of the text. He argued that the falsification of the Torah could have taken place while there existed only one copy kept by the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Ibn Hazm's arguments had a major impact upon Muslim literature and scholars, and these and other [[polemic]]al ideas were modified only slightly by some later authors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Power in the Portrayal: Representations of Jews and Muslims in Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century'', chapter "An Andalusi-Muslim Literary Typology of Jewish Heresy and Sedition", pp. 56 and further, Tahrif: p. 58, {{ISBN|0-691-00187-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Under Crescent and Cross'': The Jews in the Middle Ages, p. 146, {{ISBN|0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Layth, Ibn Rabban, and [[Ibn Qutayba]], found that there had been no corruption of the text but denounced as ''tahrif'' what they considered misleading interpretations of the text.&lt;ref name="Adang1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camilla Adang|title=Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4Ut1MjLQTMC&amp;pg=PA223|date=1 January 1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10034-3|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th-century commentator [[Ibn Khaldun]] argued in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (Introduction) that no distortion had taken place: "the statement concerning the alteration is unacceptable to thorough scholars and cannot be understood in its plain meaning".&lt;ref name="Sawyer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F.

==Biblical criticism and criticism of the Bible==
{{Main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}
The study of inconsistencies in the Bible has a long history. In the 17th century, [[Spinoza]] considered the Bible to be, "...a book rich in contradictions."&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, L., ''Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity: Essays and Lectures in Modern Jewish Thought'', SUNY Press, 1997, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, [[Thomas Paine]] in [[The Age of Reason]] compiled many of the Bible's self-contradictions. And in 1860, William Henry Burr produced a list of 144 self-contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, WH., ''Self-Contradictions of the Bible'', 1860, reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biblical studies|Biblical scholars]] have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons as a means to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it. The field has been given rise to theories such as [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s&lt;ref&gt;
Wellhausen, J., ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel: With a Reprint of the Article 'Israel' from the Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1885. reprinted Cambridge University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[documentary hypothesis]] and the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|deuteronomistic history]] (concerning the origins of the Torah and the history of Israel contained in the books from [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]] respectively),&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, SL., ''The trouble with Kings: the composition of the book of Kings in the Deuteronomistic history'', Supplements to Vetus testamentum, Brill, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and similar theories to explain why the [[Synoptic Gospels]] disagree with each other, and with the [[Gospel of John]].

===Biblical canons===
{{See also|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
The question of inconsistency covers not only the text but even the composition of scripture. Since the Bible never enumerates its own component parts, those who believe it is inerrant must appeal to extra-biblical authority to justify which books to include.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Taylor, ''The Faith of a Moralist'' (Macmillan, London, 1930) II, p. 209; quoted in Brand Blanchard, ''Reason and Belief'' (Allen and Unwin, 1974), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, different communities have accepted shifting collections of books. The size of these [[biblical canon]]s varies enormously, from the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritans]], who consider the five books of the [[Torah]] alone to be authoritative,&lt;ref&gt;The Pentateuch, or Torah, is the first five books of the bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Ethiopian Bible]], which contains all the books of all other churches plus such titles as the [[Josippon|Book of Josephus]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement|Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The contents of canons have varied over time, books regarded as authoritative by some Christians at some points in history being excluded from the collections of later communities—this was the fate of the [[List of gospels|many apocryphal Gospels]] from the first few centuries of the Church (the [[Gospel of Thomas]] is a famous example); books long regarded as canonical in one branch of Christianity may be dropped by others on doctrinal grounds (the fate of the [[deuterocanonical books]], canonical in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] but repudiated by the Protestants because they are not included in the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;"More Than One Bible." Christian History, issue 43, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and supported doctrines to which the [[Protestant reformation|Protestant reformers]] objected such as the [[intercession of saints]], [[purgatory]], [[prayers for the dead]] etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780865543737|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1995-02-13 |accessdate=2012-10-09|isbn=9780802837813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some books that could have been included, such as the [[Book of Enoch]], quoted as scriptural in {{bibleverse||Jude|1:14-15|KJV}}, were excluded from the canons of almost all later communities (see [[Book of Enoch#Canonicity|Canonicity of the Book of Enoch]]).

===Attribution of the books===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The question of internal consistency in the Bible also involves the attribution of authorship to its books. For instance, the words of the Torah, or the first five books of the Old Testament, have traditionally been believed to be by the hand of [[Moses]], and the New Testament Gospels have been attributed to the [[Four Evangelists]]. Modern scholarship calls these attributions into question.

Eliot Rabin writes: "For the past 400 years, readers have been openly questioning the traditional attribution of these five books to Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he quotes [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his 1651 [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] as writing that, when Genesis 12:6 has "and the Canaanite was then in the land", it could not have been written by Moses. Hobbes may have been the first European to question this attribution in print, arguing that the words can "only sensibly be used by someone who is writing when the Canaanites no longer are in the land ... But the Canaanites were in the land when Moses was alive."&lt;ref&gt;Martinich AP., ''The Two Gods of Leviathan: Thomas Hobbes on Religion and Politics'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin also quotes the 11th-century rabbi, [[Rashi]], as saying that Moses could not have written, in Deuteronomy 34:5, "And Moses died there", but it must have been written by [[Joshua]]. However, it is also noted that the second-century commentator [[Rabbi Meir]], has it that God dictated those words to Moses, who wrote them down with a tear in his eye.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, E., ''Understanding the Hebrew Bible: A Reader's Guide'', KTAV Publishing House, 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In none of the four [[Gospels]] does the text say that a particular book is written by the evangelist who is attributed as its author. Writers such as M. N. Ralph say that in reading the Gospels one will be struck by "a great deal of evidence" that they are compilations inherited from written and oral sources "rather than eyewitness accounts". So scholars conclude that the attributions are "not to the person who compiled it."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, MN., ''A Walk Through the New Testament: An Introduction for Catholics'', Paulist Press, 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===
{{Further information|Biblical manuscript|Textual criticism}}
Manuscripts also differ. Usually the differences are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, as in the case of the [[Comma Johanneum]], a clause in the [[First Epistle of John]] that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian [[Trinity]], but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note.&lt;ref name=DBWallace&gt;Daniel B. Wallace,"[http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1185 The Comma Johanneum and Cyprian]".&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the [[Septuagint]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] descriptions of the battle of [[David]] and [[Goliath]]: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of [[Saul]] asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.

There are also important differences between the Masoretic and [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] version of the [[Pentateuch]] in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between [[Judaism]] and [[Samaritanism]]. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like the inclusion of a passage in the Samaritan version of the [[Ten Commandments]] that restates the command to build an altar on [[Mount Gerizim]], and says plainly that Mount Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes sense that this passage is in one version and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.meson.org/religion/torahcompare.php |title=The Samaritan Pentateuch |publisher=Web.meson.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictions===
Most questions of Biblical inconsistency relate to contradictions in the narrative. Some relate to apparently minor details, for example: the number of soldiers in an army (e.g. {{bibleverse|1|Chron.|21:5|niv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Sam.|24:9|niv}}), the year a certain king began his reign (e.g. {{bibleverse|2|Chron.|36:9|kjv}} vs. {{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:8|kjv}}), the details of [[Apostle Paul]]'s itinerary (Acts 9,11,15,18:22,21 vs. Galatians 1:18,2:1). In some cases, seemingly trivial points of differences can actually have an enormous significance for the interpretation of a book or for the reconstruction of the history of Ancient Israel, how the world was created, why God allows suffering, or the religious significance of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;

}} "In some cases seemingly trivial points of difference can actually have an enormous significance for the interpretation of a book or the reconstruction of the history of ancient Israel or the life of the historical Jesus. And then there are instances that involve major issues, where one author has one point of view on an important topic  (How was the world created? Why do the people of God suffer? What is the significance of Jesus’ death?), and another author has another."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars find inconsistencies in the Old Testament and Torah and ascribe many of them to the process by which they were created. For example, the [[documentary hypothesis]] asserts that repetitions and contradictions are the result of texts that have been woven together from diverse sources written by different authors, at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Brettler|2004|pp=3–5}} "Slowly, with the rise of rationalism, particularly as associated with figures such as Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and especially Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632-1677), the view that the Torah was a unified whole, written by Moses, began to be questioned. ... This culminated in the development of the models of the Documentary Hypothesis in the 19th century, according to which the Torah (or Hexateuch) is composed of four main sources or documents which were edited or redacted together: J, E, P, and D. Each of these sources or documents is embedded in a (relatively) complete form in the current Torah, and is typified by vocabulary, literary style, and theological principles."&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Jensen wrote, "no better explanation has as yet been found of the complexities of composition of the [[Pentateuch]], and it continues to command a good consensus among scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jensen, ''God's Word to Israel'', Liturgical Press (September 1982), p. 36. {{ISBN|0-8146-5289-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this point, Ronald Witherup gives the example of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1-2, which most scholars view as two separate stories of creation written by different authors in different time periods. "Most biblical scholars accept Genesis 1 as originating around the sixth century B.C. with a group of scribes who were concerned about the preservation of the liturgical traditions of the Jews (thus the concern for the seven-day schema of creation and the notion of the sabbath). Genesis 2, on the other hand, originates from an earlier, more primitive tradition dated to around the tenth century B.C." Fundamentalists argue that this is simply the same story told twice, the first time (Gen 1:1-2:4) being poetic and the second one (Gen 2:4-25) being more anthropomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are further examples of other types of inconsistency in the Old Testament. In the account of the slaughtering of an animal before the Temple, it states that the animal: "was killed at the entrance to the tabernacle, north of the altar, and cut up." The most natural interpretation of the Hebrew wording is that the slaughtering was done by the one making the offering rather than by the priest. If so, it contradicts Ezek 44:11, where it is done by the Levites, and 2 Chr 29:22, 24 where done by the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several places in the Old Testament where numerical figures can be directly compared. For example, both {{bibleref2|Ezra|2:1–65|NIV}} and {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|7:6–67|NIV}} present the list of Jewish families that "came up out of [[Babylonian captivity|the captivity of the exiles]] ... and returned to Jerusalem and Judah". But the two lists disagree on the number of members of each family. In total, there are nearly ''twenty'' numerical discrepancies between the lists.&lt;ref&gt;The discrepancies occur in the following families: Arah, Pahath-Moab (through the line of Jeshua and Joab), Zattu, Bani, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, Adin, Bezai, Hashum, Bethlehem (and Netophah), Bethel (and Ai), Magbish, Lod (and Hadid and Ono), Senaah, Asaph, Shallum (and Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita and Shobai), Delaiah (and Tobiah and Nekoda), and the singers.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in both cases a total figure of 42,360 people is given,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Ezra|2:64|NASB}}; {{bibleverse|Nehemiah|7:66|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the partial figures do not add up to the total.&lt;ref&gt;Oded Lipschitz, Joseph Blenkinsopp, ''Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period'', (Eisenbrauns, 2003) p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the list exists in the apocryphal book [[1 Esdras]].

In Deuteronomy chapter 4, verses 1 and 8 state that Moses is about to teach the laws "today". Verse 8, in the Hebrew text, even says that the "entire Torah" is to be taught today. However, verse 5 suggests that the laws have already been delivered some time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, T., in Schipper, B. and Teeter DA. ''Wisdom and Torah: The Reception of ‘Torah’ in the Wisdom Literature of the Second Temple Period'', BRILL, 2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Bible Commentary'' notes that:
{{quote|as has long been recognized, there remain a number of variations or inconsistencies of detail, which suggests that two or more accounts have been combined. In particular, the creative acts are introduced in different ways. While in some cases God creates simply by speaking ("And God said..."), in others we are told that he performed certain actions: he made, separated, named, blessed, placed.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, orthodox rabbis, such as [[Mordechai Breuer]] deny that such inconsistencies are evidence that the words were not all created by God. He asserts that such hypotheses are false, and that the contradictory portrayals of creation are not because they were written by different authors. "Instead we refer them to the different qualities of God."&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, M., The study of the Bible and fear of Heaven, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, pp.159-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal consistency of the text===
Jewish scholars are concerned that all copies of the [[Torah]] are identical, and that each copy is consistent in its statements and in its language. The aim is to preserve the work in a condition as close to its original state as possible. This extends to consistency in spelling and the use of individual words.

B. Barry Levy notes that the 16th-century [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Rabbi Ibn Zimra]] recounted "how he restored the scrolls to their original state" and noted "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it."&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Levy also suggests that "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked as carefully as possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, BB., ''Fixing God's Torah: The Accuracy of the Hebrew Bible Text in Jewish Law'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Shnayer Leiman writes that, "Errors have crept into the best Torah scrolls. Every so often a Torah has to be returned to the ark due to an error discovered while being read in public."&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, SZ., Response to Rabbi Brewer, in Carmy, S. (ed), ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several grammatical errors are known to appear in copies of the Torah. As Shai Cherry notes, "Since one of the Rabbinic assumptions is that the Torah is perfect, at a minimum one would expect there to be no grammatical mistakes. After all, shouldn't God be an inerrant grammarian?" For examples of such mistakes, Cherry notes that, in the Cain and Abel story, where 'sin' is mentioned, "''sin (chatat)'' is feminine, but the predicate is masculine." Rabbis have suggested that this is because sin starts out weak like a woman, but ends as strong as a man. Also, in verse 7 of this story, which concerns 'daughters' so that all four suffixes should be feminine, two of them are masculine. Cherry says that such problems ought to be ascribed to "sloppy editing," but that those who believe the Torah is perfect, would say that these errors were put there intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, S., ''Torah Through Time: Understanding Bible Commentary from the Rabbinic Period to Modern Times'', Jewish Publication Society, 2010, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Christian theologians agree that the New Testament has a single and consistent theological focus on the salvific nature of Christ, but the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament consists of several different theologies. Some of these complement each other, while others are contradictory, even within the same book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf P. Knierim]], ''The Task of Old Testament Theology'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995), p. 1; Isaac Kalimi, "The Task of Hebrew Bible/ Old Testament Theology - Between Judaism and Christianity" in Wonil Kim, ''Reading the Hebrew Bible for a New Millennium'' (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of a single unifying theology, common themes recur, including (although no list can be exhaustive) [[monotheism]], the divine origins of human morality, God's election of a chosen people, the idea of the coming [[Messiah]], and the concepts of [[sin]], faithfulness, and [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]. The study of these is central to both Jewish and Christian theologies, even if they differ in their approaches. For example, although both religions believe in the coming Messiah, the Jewish expectation is different from the Christian view.

Within Christianity, themes such as the nature of God ([[trinitarianism]] and [[nontrinitarianism]]),&lt;ref&gt;God as Communion By Patricia A. Fox, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christology|nature of Jesus]], [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|views of the old covenant]], [[original sin]], [[predestination]], [[ordination of women]], [[Hell in Christianity|hell]], [[Christian eschatological differences|biblical prophecies]], etc. have continued to be a matter of dispute among theologians and [[Religious denomination|various denominations]].

===New Testament===
{{main article|Textual criticism#New Testament}}
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th century CE [[Alexandrian text-type]]; the [[Western text-type]], also very early but prone to paraphrase and other corruptions; and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which makes up above 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition. Scholars regard the Alexandrian text-type as generally more authoritative when treating [[textual criticism|textual variations]]. The majority of differences are minor—matters such as variant spellings&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland and B. Aland, "The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions &amp; To The Theory &amp; Practice Of Modern Text Criticism", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (June 1995). {{ISBN|0-8028-4098-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. F. Bruce|Bruce, Frederick Fyvie]], "''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?''", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (May 2003), {{ISBN|0-8028-2219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although at a few points the oldest manuscripts show important inconsistencies compared with the more recent ones: these include the endings of [[Mark 16]], describing Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, from the [[Gospel of Mark]]; the absence from [[Gospel of John|John]] of the story of [[Pericope Adulterae|the woman taken in adultery]]; and an explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]] (the [[Comma Johanneum]]). Scholars such as [[Bart Ehrman]] have speculated that [[John 21]] was appended to the gospel at a later date&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166&lt;/ref&gt;, but no manuscript evidence for this assertion has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;
Felix Just, 'Combining Key Methodologies in Johannine Studies', in Tom Thatcher (ed), ''What We Have Heard from the Beginning: The Past, Present, and Future of Johannine Studies'', ([[Baylor University|Baylor University Press]], 2007), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

All major modern Christian communions accept a uniform canon of 27 books, although a few small and isolated communities have either fewer or more. Nevertheless, the idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic times]] has no foundation in history, and the [[canon of the New Testament]], like that of the Old, is the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|result of a historical process]]. The very idea of a closed canon did not exist prior to the 2nd century, when it became necessary to counter movements such as [[Marcionism]]. By the end of the 4th century unanimity had been achieved in the West concerning the New Testament canon as it is today, and by the 5th century most of the East had come into harmony by accepting the Book of Revelation. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon for Roman Catholicism was not made until the [[Council of Trent]] of 1546, as until then the authority of the Scriptures was not considered higher than that of Sacred Tradition, papal bulls, and ecumenical councils. Martin Luther revived the [[antilegomena]] dispute by suggesting the removal of Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; this was not generally accepted by his followers, but these books are still ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible. The canons of other important communions were defined in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Presbyterianism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

====Internal consistency====
Biblical scholar [[Bruce M. Metzger]] mentions several internal inconsistencies in the New Testament in earlier manuscripts that later scribes attempted to correct:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
In the earlier manuscripts of Mark 1:2, the composite quotation from Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3 is introduced by the formula "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet". Later scribes, sensing this involves a difficulty replaced "As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet" with the general statement "As it is written in the prophets". Since the quotation Matthew(27:9) attributes to the prophet Jeremiah actually comes from Zechariah(11:12f), it is not surprising that some scribes sought to mend the error either by substituting the correct name or by omitting the name altogether. A few scribes attempted to harmonize the Johannine account of the chronology of the Passion with that in Mark by changing ’sixth hour’ of John 19:14 to ‘third hour’ (which appears in Mark 15:25). At John 1:28, [[Origen]] altered [[Bethany (Jerusalem)|Bethany]] to [[Bethabara]] in order to remove what he regarded as a geographical difficulty, and this reading is extant today in [[Manuscripts|MSS]]. 33 69 and many others, including those behind the [[King James version]]. The statement in Mark 8:31, that ‘the Son of man must suffer many things…and be killed and after three days rise again’, seems to involve a chronological difficulty, and some copyists changed the phrase to the more familiar expression, ‘on the third day’. The author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] places the golden [[altar of incense]] in the [[Holy of Holies]] (Heb. 9:4), which is contrary to the Old Testament description of the [[Tabernacle]] (Exod. 30:1-6). The scribe of [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and the translator of the Ethiopic version correct the account by transferring the words to 9:2, where the furniture of the [[Hekhal|Holy Place]] is itemized.}}

In the 2nd century CE, [[Tatian]] produced a gospel text called [[Diatessaron]] by weaving together all four gospels into one. The gospel compilation eliminated all the discrepancies that exist between the four gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Encountering the Manuscripts By Philip Wesley Comfort, Philip Comfort&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it omits the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogies of Jesus]] in Matthew and Luke. To fit in all canonical material, Tatian created his own narrative sequence, which is different from both the synoptic sequence and John's sequence.

====The Gospels====
{{See also|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
The problem of there being possible contradictions in the Gospels is of importance to Christians. As [[Francis Watson (priest)|Francis Watson]] writes: "The problem cannot be resolved by observing that the alleged contradictions are trivial ... [They] are far from trivial [and] there are very many of them, and they often relate to issues at the heart of the Christian faith and life."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, F., ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254 [[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'' (Detroit: Gale, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7876-4004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) replied to the writer [[Celsus]], a critic of Christianity, who had complained that some Christians had remodelled the [[Gospel]] to answer objections, agreeing that some had done so.&lt;ref name=Origen /&gt;  However, he stated that he did not believe the problem was widespread, nor did he approve of the practice, further stating that he believed that those making the alternations introduced "heresies opposed to the meaning of the doctrine of Jesus".&lt;ref name=Origen&gt;{{cite web|author=Origen|title = Contra Celsus, Book II, Chapter XXVII|url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html|accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a 5th-century attempt to explain away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, A. and Cavadini, JC., ''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, p. 132 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that because there are those who would "rob [the Evangelists] of their credit as veracious historians", "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other."&lt;ref&gt;

St. Augustine of Hippo, in ''The Harmony Of The Gospels (Extended Annotated Edition)'', Jazzybee Verlag, 2012, Chapter VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas more modern apologists, such as [[Gleason Archer]], in producing a book that provides explanations for many Bible difficulties, writes: "Be fully persuaded in your own mind that an adequate explanation exists, even though you have not yet found it."&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those who accept that there are inconsistencies, scholars such as [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the [[infancy narrative]]s of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

P. Sanders, 'Jesus from the Jewish point of view', in ''The Cambridge History of Judaism'' ed William Horbury, vol 3: the Early Roman Period, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sanders | first=Ed Parish | authorlink=E.

As a further example, the "[[Markan Appendix]]" "is universally accepted to have not been written by the author",&lt;ref&gt;Nave, DN., ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts'',BRILL, 2002 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mark 16:9-20 was added later so that the Gospel of Mark originally ended at [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscript tradition|Mark 16:8]].&lt;ref&gt;The role and function of repentance in Luke-Acts, by Guy D.

[[Historical-grammatical method|Grammatico-historical]] [[exegesis]] is determining the meaning of scripture by understanding the author's environment outside the Bible, as well as the scripture itself.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt; [[R.T. France|R. T. France]] states this form of exegesis involves the "fullest possible use of linguistic, literary, historical, archaeological, and other data bearing on that author's environment".&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=France/&gt; --&gt;

France, regarding the "distinctive contribution" of each of the four gospels, commented, "In accepting that God intended his church to have four Gospels, not just one, Christians have also recognized that each has something different to say about Jesus. It is only after we have listened to each in its individuality that we can hope to gain the full richness which comes from the 'stereoscopic' vision of Jesus as seen through four different pairs of eyes!"&lt;ref name=France2&gt;France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[two-source hypothesis]] remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels: according to this, there are two sources, the Gospel of Mark and a lost, hypothetical sayings collection called [[Q Document|Q]] (''see also, [[Two-source hypothesis#Other hypotheses|other hypotheses]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, RL., ''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'',Kregel Academic, 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Two-source Hypothesis is not without [[Two-source hypothesis#Problems with the hypothesis|its problems]].

====Examples====
A wide variety of inconsistencies have been suggested both within the New Testament and between the New Testament and the Hebrew scriptures. These fall into a number of broad categories. The more prominent are identified and discussed below, with examples.

=====Gospels=====
{{see also|Historical reliability of the Gospels|Gospel harmony}}
Internal consistency within the [[synoptic gospels]] has been analysed by many scholars. A well-known example is the nativity narratives found in the Gospel of Matthew ({{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1-6|NASB}}) and the Gospel of Luke ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:32-34|NASB}}). Each gives a [[genealogy of Jesus]], but the names, and even the number of generations, differ between the two. &lt;!--refs should not be needed because it's wikilinked!--&gt;Apologists have suggested that the differences are the result of two different lineages, Matthew's from King David's son, Solomon, to Jacob, father of Joseph, and Luke's from King David's other son, Nathan, to [[Heli (Bible)|Heli]], father of Mary and father-in-law of Joseph.&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;Warren, Tony. [http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html "Is there a Contradiction in the Genealogies of Luke and Matthew?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001045/http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/faq/birth2.html |date=2012-11-14 }} Created 2/2/95 / Last Modified 24 January 2000. Accessed 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scholar [[Geza Vermes]] points out that Luke makes no mention of Mary, and questions what purpose a maternal genealogy would serve in a Jewish setting.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', (Penguin, 2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] pointed out another conflict, between {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}("[[You're either with us, or against us|He who is not with Me is against Me]]; and he who does not gather with Me scatters") and {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}("For he who is not against us [''you''] is for us [''you'']"). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality".  He argued that both are necessary and that "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true."&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer&gt;[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], "''Ethics''", p. 60–61, Touchstone; (September 1, 1995, reprint of his 1943 book) {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.A. Carson]] commented similarly, adding he thought there are two different contexts where {{bibleverse|Mark|9:40|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|9:50|NASB}}describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while {{bibleverse|Matthew|12:30|NASB}}/{{bibleverse|Luke|11:23|NASB}}describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Carson, Commentary on Matthew, Expositor's Bible Commentary CDROM, [[Zondervan]], 1989–97&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;See the commentaries by [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/gospels.viii.xiii.html?scrBook=Mark&amp;scrCh=9-9&amp;scrV=40-40#viii.xiii-p0.1 McGarvey] on Mk 9:40, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/johnson_bw/pnt.pnt0112.html Johnson] on Mt 12:30, and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/jamieson/jfb.xi.i.xiv.html?scrBook=Matt&amp;scrCh=12-12&amp;scrV=30-30#xi.i.xiv-p55.1 Brown] on Lk 11:23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern New Testament scholarship tends to view these not as separate statements, but rather one statement that has either been preserved in two different forms, or has been altered by the Gospel writers to present a point of view that expresses the needs of the Christian community at the time.&lt;ref name=Culpepper&gt;R. Alan Culpepper, John, the Son of Zebedee: The Life of a Legend, Continuum International Publishing (2000), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Mark, generally considered the earliest of the Gospels, presents the 'inclusive' formulation, in association with an account of Jesus rebuking his followers for stopping someone from carrying out [[exorcisms]] in his name. The Gospel of Matthew has the other, 'exclusive' version, preceded by a [[Parable of the strong man|story about a strong man]]; the Gospel of Mark also includes this story, but without the concluding observation. The Luke version presents both versions. There is still lively discussion about which version is the more authentic,&lt;ref name=Culpepper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian H. Henderson, ''Jesus, Rhetoric and Law'', Brill (1996), pp. 333–334; William David Davies, Dale C. Allison, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'', Continuum International Publishing (2004), pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt; see also the [[Jesus Seminar]].

Barton and Muddiman cite inconsistencies between the gospel writers about what happened at Christ's tomb. They note that "In Mk 16:1 there are three women at the tomb, in Mt 28:1 two, and in Lk 23:55-24:10 more than three. In Mark and Luke they come with spices to anoint Jesus, but in the Fourth Gospel this has already been done.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond E. Brown]] notes the apparent disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting the words of Jesus concerning his prediction of the destruction of the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the [[Wailing Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, RE., ''An Introduction to New Testament Christology'', Paulist Press, 1994, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ehrman, a more important difference among the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became human is only claimed in the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Ehrmanr&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus, Interrupted, Harper Collins Publishing (2009), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Douglad McCready, ''He Came Down from Heaven: The Preexistence of Christ And the Christian Faith.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Gathercole]], ''The Preexistent Son: Recovering the Christologies of Matthew, Mark and Luke.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acts of the Apostles=====
{{Main article|Conversion of Paul}}
{{See also|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}
In the "''Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties''", [[Gleason Archer|Archer]] examines two verses in Acts describing the [[Conversion of Paul]] which are sometimes perceived as a contradiction:&lt;ref name=ArcherBD&gt;Archer, Gleason L., "Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties", p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''The men who travelled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one''" {{bibleverse|Acts|9:7|NASB}}
:"''And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me''" {{bibleverse|Acts|22:9|NASB}}
Archer claims that the original Greek shows "there is no real contradiction between these two statements" because "Greek makes a distinction between hearing a sound as a noise (in which case the object to the verb "to hear" takes the genitive case) and hearing a voice as a thought-conveying message (in which case it takes the accusative)" and "in neither account is it stated that his companions ever heard that Voice in the accusative case".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;  Archer points to similar circumstances where "the crowd who heard the sound of the Father talking to the Son in John 12:28 ... perceived it only as thunder".&lt;ref name=ArcherBD /&gt;

{{bibleverse|Acts|17:15-16}} is another troublesome part:

:"''So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.''"

The verse appear to place Jacob's burial in [[Shechem]], contradicting verses in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] which places the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] tomb in [[Hebron]]. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] writes "the text now stands, it is an evident error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblehub.com/commentaries/acts/7-15.htm|title=Acts 7:15 Commentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gospel and Acts=====
{{See also|Judas Iscariot}}
In {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:3-8|NASB}}, Judas returns the bribe Christians believe he had immorally accepted for handing over Jesus, throwing the money into the temple before hanging himself. The temple priests, unwilling to return the defiled money to the treasury,&lt;ref&gt;"It was not lawful to take into the Temple-treasury, for the purchase of sacred things, money that had been unlawfully gained." [[Alfred Edersheim]] [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; used it instead to buy a field known as the Potter's Field, as a plot in which to bury strangers. In {{bibleverse|Acts|1:18|NASB}}, on the other hand, Judas, having not committed suicide out of guilt, used the bribe money to buy the field himself, and his death in the field is attributed thus: "falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."

[[Raymond E. Brown]] points to the obvious contradiction: "Luke's account of the death of Judas in Acts 1:18 is scarcely reconcilable with Matt 27:3-10."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel harmony|Harmonization]] of the two accounts has been tried since ancient times&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Alfred Edersheim]] concluded, "there is no real divergence". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.x.xiv.html Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, 5.xiv], 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;  and occasionally still today.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr C Gempt suggests: "The details that seem at variance can be reconciled...after refusing the money the priests bought the field in Judas' name..and it was there that he hanged himself." His body was no longer hanging by the time it was discovered, but had fallen ... to the ground where it had split open.'Inter-Varsity Press New Bible Commentary 21st Century edition p1071&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars tend to find these unconvincing,&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Talbert, ''Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary'', Smyth &amp; Helwys (2005) p. 15. {{ISBN|1-57312-277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out, for instance, the absence of any indication of suicide in the story in Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Mikeal C. Parsons, ''Acts'' (Baker Academic, 2008) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Epistles=====
{{Main article|Antinomianism}}
The [[Tübingen school]] of historians founded by [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F. C. Baur]] believes that in [[Early Christianity]], there was conflict between [[Pauline Christianity]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]] led by [[James the Just]], [[Simon Peter]], and [[John the Apostle]], the so-called "[[Jewish Christians]]" or "Pillars of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08280a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. James the Less]: "Then we lose sight of James till St. Paul, three years after his conversion (A.D. 37), went up to Jerusalem. ... On the same occasion, the "pillars" of the Church, James, Peter, and John "gave to me (Paul) and Barnabas the [[Right hand of Christian fellowship|right hands of fellowship]]; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision" (Galatians 2:9)."&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed that the [[gentiles]] and Jewish Christians were no longer obligated to keep the Mosaic law ({{bibleref2|Gal|2:21}}). The Jewish Christians disagreed, believing that everyone, including the gentiles, must keep the Mosaic law. In {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:14}}, part of the "[[Incident at Antioch]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers] see section titled: "THE INCIDENT AT ANTIOCH"&lt;/ref&gt; Paul publicly rebuked Peter for [[judaize|judaizing]].

[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] claims several times that believers are saved by [[Divine grace]], and that believers are therefore ''"not under law, but under [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Rom|6:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the ''"whole law"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''"a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone"'', and that ''"faith without works is dead"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|James|2:14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants, with their belief in [[Sola Fide|salvation by faith alone]], have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. [[Martin Luther]], for example, asserted that the [[Epistle of James]] might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its canonicity - see [[Antilegomena]]).

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe that Paul and James do not contradict each other but speak about different questions.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Douglas J. Moo]] writes that ''"if a sinner can get into relationship with God only by faith (Paul), the ultimate validation of that relationship takes into account the works that true faith must inevitably produce (James)."''Douglas J. Moo, ''The Letter of James'', Erdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 141 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQJgtkaIUTIC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+letter+of+james+douglas+j.+moo#PPA141,M1 The Letter of James]&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that the perspective of Paul is different from, and complementary to, that of James - ''"When Paul claims that one is justified by faith alone, apart from works, he is referring to works that precede salvation. Conversely, when James insists on works as necessary to justification, he has in view works that follow and validate salvation."''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Bruce Compton: [http://www.dbts.edu/journals/1997/Jas2.pdf James 2:21-24 and the justification of Abraham, p. 44] - many scholars are referred to in the footnotes!&lt;/ref&gt; Paul states in various passages that works have to follow faith ({{bibleref2|Titus|2:11-12}}, {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:10}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|6:13}}, {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:13}}, etc.).

In [[I Corinthians]]: "Inconsistencies have been found within later chapters, for instance between an apparently softer stance on sacrificial food in 8:1-13 and 10:22-11:1, and a harder line in 10:1-22."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the letter "seems to place a total ban on women's speech in church, which is strangely inconsistent with Paul's permission in 11:2-16 that (veiled) women could pray and prophesy."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, J. and Muddiman, J., ''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', OUP Oxford, 2007, p. 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Old Testament versus New Testament=====
{{Main article|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Christianity and Judaism|New Covenant|Antinomianism|Ethics in the Bible}}
In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian [[Marcion]] composed a work (now lost) entitled ''Antithesis''. In the Antithesis, [[Marcion]] set out in detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcionite-scripture.info/CB-The-Antithesis.pdf The Antithesis], Dr. Carroll Bierbower&lt;/ref&gt; The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was "[[an eye for an eye]]", but [[Matthew 5:39|Jesus set this precept aside]]. Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 "''I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things''. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that "''a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit''" and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, [[Elisha]] had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, "''Let the little children come to me''". [[Joshua]] had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] quoted Jesus as commanding "''Let not the sun go down on your wrath''"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, [[divorce]] was permitted and so was [[polygamy]]; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. [[Moses]] enforced the [[Jewish Sabbath]] and [[Jewish Law]]; Jesus has [[Christian liberty|de-institutionalised]] both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example,  God commanded that no work should be done on the Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the [[ark of the covenant|ark]] around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]]. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiX5d09931UC&amp;pg=PA92 The canon of the New Testament: its origin, development, and significance], [[Bruce Manning Metzger]], p. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The early church, [[W. H. C. Frend]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God, [[Adolf Von Harnack]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian view is that [[Jesus]] mediates a [[New Covenant]] relationship between God and his followers and [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abolished the Mosaic Laws]], according to the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:15-18}}; {{bibleverse||Gal|3:23-25}}; {{bibleverse|2|Cor|3:7-17}}; {{bibleverse||Eph|2:15}}; {{bibleverse||Heb|8:13}}, {{bibleverse||Rom|7:6}} etc.) From a [[Jewish]] perspective however, the [[Torah]] was given to the Jewish people and [[B'nei Noah]] as an eternal covenant (for example {{bibleverse||Exod|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse||Exod|12:14-17}}, {{bibleverse||Mal|3:6-7}}) and will never be replaced or added to (for example {{bibleverse||Deut|4:2}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|13:1|HE}}). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of attempts to harmonize biblical statements that the biblical law is eternal ({{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16-17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exod|12:14-17}}) with New Testament statements that suggest that it [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|does not now apply at all]], or at least [[Cafeteria Christianity|does not fully apply]]. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of [[Paul the Apostle#Relationship with Judaism|Paul and the Law]] is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gundry, ed., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, see [[New Perspective on Paul]], [[Pauline Christianity]]); hence the various views.

The '''International Association for Accounting Education &amp; Research''' (IAAER) is a non-profit organization that promotes excellence in accounting education and [[accounting research|research]]. The organization also seeks to ensure that accounting academics make the maximum contribution to development of excellent accounting standards.&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

==Foundation==

The origins of the IAAER can be traced back to meetings of the International Congresses on Accounting that started in 1904. The [[International Federation of Accountants]] began holding separate International Conferences on Accounting Education in 1962. IAAER was founded in 1984 to serve as a co-host with the Japanese Accounting Association for the sixth of these conferences, which was scheduled to be held in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] in 1987. 
Its organization was defined at a meeting in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] on 17 August 1984, with representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Membership==

IAAER offers institutional, university, individual, and student memberships.  
As of 2009, IAAER had about 50 institutional members, including professional accounting bodies such as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and accounting academic organizations such as the [[American Accounting Association]].
In 2009, IAAER announced that all members would have access to eIFRS, an online repository of material about [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

IAAER contributes to international accounting and auditing standards through relationships with various international bodies, bringing a research-based academic viewpoint. Specifically, IAAER is represented on the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), the Education Advisory Group of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the Standards Advisory Council of the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).&lt;ref name=IAAERabout/&gt;

The '''jansky''' (symbol '''Jy''') is a non-[[SI]] unit of spectral [[flux density]],&lt;ref&gt;http://science.jrank.org/pages/57879/jansky.html {{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[spectral irradiance]], used especially in [[radio astronomy]]. It is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s per [[square metre]] per [[hertz]].

The ''flux density'' or ''monochromatic flux'', &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of a source is the integral of the spectral radiance, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, over the source [[solid angle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \iint\limits_\text{source} B(\theta,\phi) \,\mathrm{d}\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

The unit is named after pioneering US radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] and is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author1=Burke, Bernard F. |author2=Graham-Smith, Francis | title=An Introduction to Radio Astronomy
  | page=9 | edition=3rd | date=2009
  | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
  | isbn=0-521-87808-X }}&lt;!-- Citation is for the first equivalence in this expression. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1~\text{Jy} = 10^{-26} \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2{\cdot}\text{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[SI]]) &lt;math&gt; = 10^{-23} \frac{\text{erg}}{\text{s} {\cdot}\text{cm}^2{\cdot}\text{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]]).

Since the jansky is obtained by integrating over the whole source solid angle, it is most simply used to describe point sources; for example, the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] (3C) reports results in Jy.

* For extended sources, the surface brightness is often described with units of Jy per solid angle; for example, far-infrared (FIR) maps from the [[IRAS]] satellite are in MJy/[[Steradian|sr]].
* Although extended sources at all wavelengths can be reported with these units, for radio-frequency maps, extended sources have traditionally been described in terms of a [[brightness temperature]]; for example the [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985BICDS..28...49H Haslam et al.] 408&amp;nbsp;MHz all-sky continuum survey is reported in terms of a brightness temperature in [[kelvin|K]].

==Unit conversions==
Jansky units are not a standard SI Unit, so it may be necessary to convert the measurements made in the unit to the SI equivalent in terms of watts per square metre per hertz (W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz)). However, other unit conversions are possible with respect to measuring this unit.

===AB magnitude===
The flux density in Jy can be converted to a magnitude basis, for suitable assumptions about the spectrum. For instance, converting an [[AB magnitude]] to a flux-density in microjanskys is straightforward:&lt;ref name="fuk95"&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Fukugita 
| title=Galaxy Colors in Various Photometric Band Systems | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date=1995 | volume=107 | pages=945–958 | doi=10.1086/133643 | last2=Shimasaku | first2=K. | last3=Ichikawa | first3=T.
|bibcode = 1995PASP..107..945F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_v~[\mu\text{Jy}] = 10^{6} \cdot 10^{23} \cdot 10^{-(\text{AB} + 48.6)/2.5} = 10^{(23.9 - \text{AB})/2.5}.&lt;/math&gt;

===dBW/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅Hz)===

The linear flux density in Jy can be converted to a [[decibel]] basis, suitable for use in fields of telecommunication and radio engineering.

1 jansky is equal to −260 [[Decibel watt|dBW]]/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz), or −230 [[dBm]]/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucaf.org/sschool/mike/Units_and_Calculations.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223821/http://www.iucaf.org/sschool/mike/Units_and_Calculations.ppt |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{dBW}/(\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{Hz})} = 10 \log_{10}(P_\text{Jy}) - 260,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{dBm}/(\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{Hz})} = 10 \log_{10}(P_\text{Jy}) - 230.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==
The flux to which the jansky refers can be in any form of energy.

It was created for and is still most frequently used in reference to electromagnetic energy, especially in the context of radio astronomy.

The brightest [[astronomical radio source]]s have flux densities of the order of 1–100 janskys.  For example, the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] lists some 300 to 400 radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere brighter than 9&amp;nbsp;Jy at 159&amp;nbsp;MHz.  This range makes the jansky a suitable unit for [[radio astronomy]].

[[Gravitational waves]] also carry energy, so their flux density can also be expressed in terms of janskys.  Typical signals on Earth are expected to be 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Jy or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of the poor coupling of gravitational waves to matter, such signals are difficult to detect.

When measuring broadband continuum emissions, where the energy is roughly evenly distributed across the detector [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the detected signal will increase in proportion to the bandwidth of the detector (as opposed to signals with bandwidth narrower than the detector bandpass). To calculate the flux density in janskys, the total power detected (in watts) is divided by the receiver collecting area (in square meters), and then divided by the detector bandwidth (in hertz).  The flux density of astronomical sources is many orders of magnitude below 1 W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz), so the result is multiplied by 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to get a more appropriate unit for natural astrophysical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">[[Image:PancakeCutThrice.agr.jpg|thumb|Pancake cut into seven pieces with three straight cuts.]]
The '''lazy caterer's sequence,''' more formally known as the '''central polygonal numbers''', describes the maximum number of pieces of a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] (a [[pancake]] or [[pizza]] is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given number of straight cuts. For example, three cuts across a pancake will produce six pieces if the cuts all meet at a common point inside the circle, but up to seven if they do not. This problem can be formalized mathematically as one of counting the cells in an [[arrangement of lines]]; for generalizations to higher dimensions, ''see'' [[arrangement of hyperplanes]].

The analogue of this sequence in three dimensions is the [[cake number]].

==Formula and sequence==
The maximum number ''p'' of pieces that can be created with a given number of cuts ''n'', where ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{n^2+n+2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[binomial coefficient]]s, the formula can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;p = 1 + {\tbinom {n + 1} 2} = {\tbinom n 0}+{\tbinom n 1}+{\tbinom n 2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This [[sequence]] {{OEIS|id=A000124}}, starting with &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, results in

:[[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[16 (number)|16]], [[22 (number)|22]], [[29 (number)|29]], [[37 (number)|37]], [[46 (number)|46]], [[56 (number)|56]], [[67 (number)|67]], [[79 (number)|79]], [[92 (number)|92]], [[106 (number)|106]], [[121 (number)|121]], [[137 (number)|137]], [[154 (number)|154]], [[172 (number)|172]], [[191 (number)|191]], [[211 (number)|211]], ...

Each number equals 1 plus a [[triangular number]].

==Proof==
[[File:Lazy Caterer's Sequence (Cuts).gif|thumb|The maximum number of pieces from consecutive cuts are the numbers in the Lazy Caterer's Sequence.]]
When a circle is cut ''n'' times to produce the maximum number of pieces, represented as ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;fnof;''(''n''), the ''n''th cut must be considered; the number of pieces before the last cut is ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1), while the number of pieces added by the last cut is ''n''.

To obtain the maximum number of pieces, the ''n''th cut line should cross all the other previous cut lines inside the circle, but not cross any intersection of previous cut lines. Thus, the ''n''th line itself is cut in ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 places, and into ''n'' line segments.  Each segment divides one piece of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-cut pancake into 2 parts, adding exactly ''n'' to the number of pieces. The new line can't have any more segments since it can only cross each previous line once.  A cut line can always cross over all previous cut lines, as rotating the knife at a small angle around a point that is not an existing intersection will, if the angle is small enough, intersect all the previous lines including the last one added.

Thus, the total number of pieces after ''n'' cuts is

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+f(n-1).&lt;/math&gt;

This [[recurrence relation]] can be solved.  If ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) is expanded one term the relation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+(n-1)+f(n-2).&lt;/math&gt;

Expansion of the term ''&amp;fnof;''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) can continue until the last term is reduced to ''&amp;fnof;''(0), thus,

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+(n-1)+(n-2)+\cdots+1+f(0).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;, because there is one piece before any cuts are made, this can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=1+(1+2+3+\cdots + n).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified, using the formula for the sum of an [[arithmetic progression]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=1+\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|750px|thumb|right|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]

It prioritizes scientific research as the basis of innovation, and plays down the role of later players in the innovation process.

Current models of [[innovation]] derive from approaches such as [[Actor-Network Theory]], [[Social shaping of technology]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/53871734|title=Networks of innovation : change and meaning in the age of the Internet|last=Ilkka.|first=Tuomi,|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199256985|oclc=53871734}}&lt;/ref&gt;,provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works. Current ideas in [[Open Innovation]] and [[User innovation]] derive from these later ideas. 

In the 'Phase Gate Model' , the product or services concept is frozen at an early stage to minimize risk. Through enterprise, the innovation process involves a series of sequential phases arranged in a manner that the preceding phase muse be cleared before movie to the next phase. Therefore a project must pass through a gate with the permission of the gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase.

Criteria for passing through each gate is defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for the preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place during the preceding phase or not.

Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented:

# "technology push" model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The stages of the "Technology Push" model are: 

:Basic science→Design and engineering→Manufacturing→Marketing→Sales

From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the "market pull" model of innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Roy|date=1994-02|title=Towards the Fifth‐generation Innovation Process|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02651339410057491|journal=International Marketing Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=7–31|doi=10.1108/02651339410057491|issn=0265-1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the "market pull " model are:

:Market need—Development—Manufacturing—Sales.

The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different "stages" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation. A history of the linear model of innovation may be found in Godin ''The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godin|first1=Benoit|title=The Linear Model of Innovation: The Historical Construction of an Analytical Framework|journal=Science, Technology &amp; Human Values|year=2006|volume=31|pages=639–667|url=http://www.csiic.ca/PDF/Godin_30.pdf|doi=10.1177/0162243906291865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

{{Main|Tree}}
The world's '''superlative trees''' can be ranked by any factor. Records have been kept for trees with superlative height, trunk diameter or girth, canopy coverage, airspace volume, wood volume, estimated mass, and age.

==Tallest==
[[File:Redwood National Park REDW9343.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[conifer]]ous [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') is the tallest tree species on earth.]]

The heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with [[laser rangefinder]]s or with [[measuring tape|tape]] drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older [[tree height measurement]] methods are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15%  or more above the real height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org |title=Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817101700/http://www.nativetreesociety.org/# |archive-date=2018-08-17 |access-date=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical claims of trees growing to {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and even {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are now largely disregarded as unreliable, and attributed to human error.

The following are the tallest reliably measured specimens from the top species. This table shows only currently standing specimens:

The largest trees are defined as having the highest wood volume in a single-stem. These trees are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. Few attempts have ever been made to include [[root]] or [[leaf]] volume.

[[File:TeMatuaNgahereWithPerson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Trunk of [[Te Matua Ngahere]] ]]

The [[circumference|girth]] of a tree is usually much easier to measure than the height, as it is a simple matter of stretching a tape round the trunk, and pulling it taut to find the circumference. Despite this, UK tree author [[Alan Mitchell]] made the following comment about measurements of [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees:

{{quote|The aberrations of past measurements of yews are beyond belief. For example, the tree at Tisbury has a well-defined, clean, if irregular bole at least 1.5&amp;nbsp;m long. It has been found to have a girth that dilated and shrunk in the following way: 11.28 m (1834 Loudon), 9.3&amp;nbsp;m (1892 Lowe), 10.67&amp;nbsp;m (1903 Elwes and Henry), 9.0 m (1924 E. Swanton), 9.45&amp;nbsp;m (1959 Mitchell)&amp;nbsp;... Earlier measurements have therefore been omitted.|Alan Mitchell; in a handbook "''Conifers in the British Isles''".&lt;ref name=afm2/&gt;}}

As a general standard, tree girth is taken at "breast height". This is converted to and cited as '''dbh''' ([[diameter at breast height]]) in tree and forestry literature.&lt;ref name=afm/&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; Breast height is defined differently in different situations, with most [[forestry]] measurements taking girth at 1.3 m above ground,&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=G. J.|year=1975|title=Forest Mensuration Handbook|publisher=Forestry Commission Booklet|volume=39|isbn=0-11-710023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those who measure [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] usually measure at 1.5 m above ground;&lt;ref name=afm/&gt; in most cases this makes little difference to the measured girth. On sloping ground, the "above ground" reference point is usually taken as the highest point on the ground touching the trunk,&lt;ref name=afm&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1974|title=A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe|publisher=Collins|isbn=0-00-212035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton/&gt; but in North America a point, that is the average of the highest point and the lowest point the tree trunk appears to contact the soil, is usually used.&lt;ref name=NTS_measuring_guidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nativetreesociety.org/measure/Tree_Measuring_Guidelines-revised1.pdf |title=Tree Measuring Guidelines of the Eastern Native Tree Society |publisher=Native Tree Society |date= March 2008|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the inflated old measurements may have been taken at ground level. Some past exaggerated measurements also result from measuring the complete next-to-bark measurement, pushing the tape in and out over every crevice and buttress.&lt;ref name=afm2&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=A. F.|year=1972|title=Conifers in the British Isles|publisher=Forestry Commission|id=Booklet 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements could also be influenced by deviation of the tape measure from a horizontal plane (which might seem called for if the trunk does not grow straight up), and the presence of features such as branches, spikes, ''etc''.

Modern trends are to cite the tree's [[diameter]] rather than the circumference. The diameter of the tree is calculated by finding the mean diameter of the trunk, in most cases obtained by dividing the measured circumference by [[pi|π]]; this assumes the trunk is mostly circular in cross-section (an oval or irregular cross-section would result in a mean diameter slightly greater than the assumed circle). Accurately measuring circumference or diameter is difficult in species with the large buttresses that are characteristic of many species of rainforest trees. Simple measurement of circumference of such trees can be misleading when the circumference includes much empty space between buttresses. See also [[Tree girth measurement]]

[[Baobab]]s (genus ''Adansonia'') store large amounts of [[water]] in the very soft wood in their trunks. This leads to marked variation in their girth over the year (though not more than about 2.5%&lt;ref name=Fenner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenner|first=M|year=1980|title=Some measurements on the water relations of baobab trees|journal=Biotropica|volume=12|pages=205–209|issue=3|doi=10.2307/2387972|jstor=2387972}}&lt;/ref&gt;), reaching maximum at the end of the rainy season, and minimum at the end of the dry season.

Measurements become ambiguous when multiple trunks (whether from an individual tree or multiple trees) grow together.
The [[Sacred Fig]] grows adventitious roots from its branches, which become new trunks when the root reaches the ground and thickens; a single sacred fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A |year=1992 |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-47494-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-stemmed [[Hundred Horse Chestnut]] was known to have a circumference of {{convert|57.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} when it was measured in 1780.

There are known more than 50 species of trees exceeding the diameter of 4.45 m or circumference of 14 m.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates grow continuously and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees that are solid to the center. Many very old trees become hollow as the dead [[heartwood]] decays. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually largely speculation. White (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=J|year=1990|title=Estimating the Age of Large and Veteran Trees in Britain|publisher=Forestry Commission|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the [[United Kingdom]] through the correlation of a tree's age with its diameter and growth character.

==Thickest tree limbs==
This list is limited to horizontal or nearly horizontal limbs, in which the governing growth factor is phototropism. Vertical or near vertical limbs, in which the governing growth factor is negative geotropism, are called "reiterations" and are really divisions of the trunk, which by definition must be less than the trunk as a whole and therefore less remarkable. The thickest trunks have already been dealt with under "stoutest".{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

'''Marc Fumaroli''' (born 10 June 1932 in [[Marseille]]), is a French historian and essayist. Fumaroli was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 2 March 1995 and became its director. He is also a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], the sister academy devoted to high erudition. Following his appointment to a chair in Seventeenth Century Studies at the University of Paris-IV, La Sorbonne (1980), he was elected to a Chair in Rhetoric and Society in Europe (16th and 17th century) at the [[Collège de France]]. He held it from 1986 to 2002, until mandatory retirement, and is now an emeritus professor. He is acknowledged for the revival of [[Rhetoric]] as field of study of European culture, in a sharp move away from both structuralism and post-modernism. His pioneering work remains ''L'Age De l'Eloquence'' (1980).  This massive work redrew the map of rhetorical scholarship across Europe. Fumaroli was also a member of the [[University of Chicago]]'s Committee on Social Thought.  He is a recipient of the prestigious [[Balzan Prize]], the "Nobel" of the humanities (in 2001). He is a foreign member of the [[British Academy]] and of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

The '''Mid-Atlantic Ridge Ecosystem Project''' MAR-ECO is an international research project in which scientists from 16 nations take part. Norway, represented by the Institute of Marine Research and the University of Bergen, co-ordinates the project which will enhance our understanding of occurrence, distribution and ecology of animals and animal communities along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Iceland and the Azores. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the volcanic mountain range in the middle of the ocean, marking the spreading zone between the Eurasian and American continental plates. New ocean floor is constantly being formed, and Iceland and the Azores are volcanic islands created when the mid-ocean ridge breaks the sea surface. The groups of animals to be studied are fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods (squids) and a wide range of gelatinous animals (e.g. jellyfish) living either near the seabed or in midwater above the ridge.

The research programme [[Census of Marine Life]] seriously addresses this situation and challenges marine biologists to utilize the most advanced technology to achieve true new information in areas of the ocean that were poorly studied previously. The project MAR-ECO, an element of the [[Census of Marine Life]], rises to the challenge and investigates the diverse animal life along the vast underwater mountain chains of the open ocean.

==History==
MAR-ECO adopts the most advanced technology and instruments for observing and sample the animals and to tackle the challenge of working to 3500 m depth and in rugged terrain. An international multidisciplinary team of biologists, oceanographers, and engineers is offered this rare opportunity. A number of countries have committed their best research vessels, and in the 2003-2005 and 2007-2010 field phases a number of research cruise were conducted. In 2004, a two-month major international expedition was carried out by the new Norwegian vessel RV G.O. Sars, but vessels from Iceland, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, USA, and Portugal have also made major contributions. In June 2003 a Russian-US cruise using the manned submersibles MIR-1 and -2 took scientists to areas never before visited by humans at 4500m below the surface.
Contributing to sustainable development

MAR-ECO shall enhance the basic knowledge of ocean life and thereby contribute to a sustainable international management of marine resources and the priceless biodiversity of the marine environment. Knowledge obtained by a unified international effort carries greater weight in the policy-making processes than information gathered by isolated national research. Good science may hopefully lead to international consensus on appropriate action.

MAR-ECO and the Census of Marine Life emphasises public outreach and even in the planning phase MAR-ECO has enjoyed considerable public attention and support. Expeditions to unknown depths of the oceans appear to have great appeal, both to scientists and the interested laymen of all ages.

===Management===
The MAR-ECO management consists of a Norwegian secretariat, a public outreach group, and an international steering group. The co-ordinating institutions are Institute of Marine Research and the University of Bergen in Norway. 

Members of the international steering group are experienced scientists from key institutions in Norway, Iceland, Portugal (Azores), France, Germany, United Kingdom, USA, Russia and Brazil. Chair: Odd Aksel Bergstad, Norway.

The project consists of 10 integrated science components dealing with different key objectives, each with dedicated teams and principal investigators. In addition, a range of education and outreach components facilitates dissemination of results to a wide audience. 

Common critical tasks are funded by A.P.Sloan Foundation (USA), and national sources.

====Public Outreach Group and associates====
The Public Outreach Group is based in Bergen, Norway, but has associates among project participants in other countries. The group works closely with the Education and Outreach team of the Census of Marine Life based in the USA.

==Backgrounders==
The Mar-ECO project presented an exhibit in the [[Sant Ocean Hall]] of the [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 2010.  The exhibit featured specimens, photography, art, models, and multimedia about the discoveries of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/deeperthanlight/ Natural History Museum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">Between 2008 and 2011, the '''Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''  was an academic center established at the [[University of Chicago]] as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary site for research in economics. The Institute aimed to advance, refine, and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, [[Milton Friedman]], who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis. The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Department of Economics, and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields. The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis--an approach exemplified by Friedman and others. 

The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post-doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create "a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.”&lt;ref name="mfiannounce"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 15, 2008 |title=University of Chicago economists to focus their pioneering research in new institute honoring the memory of Milton Friedman |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/05/15/university-chicago-economists-focus-their-pioneering-research-new-institute-honor }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university had initially planned to invest $200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations.

The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman, who was viewed as polarizing. The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute "a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University" and that the proposal reflected "a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of 'economy and society'".&lt;ref name=corespetition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miltonfriedmancores.org/cores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807201459/http://www.miltonfriedmancores.org/cores/ |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neozealandia''' is a [[biogeographic province]] of the [[Antarctic Realm]] according to the classification developed by [[Miklos Udvardy]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18"&gt;{{cite book | last = Udvardy | first = M. D. F. | title = A Classification of the Biogeographical Provinces of the World | year = 1975 | publisher = IUCN | location = Morges, Switzerland }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The CoEvolution Quarterly"&gt;{{cite book | last = Udvardy | first = Miklos D. F. | title = World Biogeographical Provinces (Map) | year = 1975 | publisher = CoEvolution | location = Sausalito, California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Neozealandia consists primarily of the major islands of [[New Zealand]], including [[North Island]] and [[South Island]], as well as [[Chatham Island]]. The southernmost areas of Neozealandia overlap with the [[Insulantarctica]] province, which includes the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]].

Both New Zealand and the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands are remnants of a submerged [[subcontinent]] known as [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which gradually submerged itself beneath the sea after breaking off from the Gondwanan land masses of [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]. Due to isolation, the entire Zealandia [[archipelago]] has remained virtually free of [[mammal]]s (except for [[bat]]s and a few others) and [[invasive species|invasive]] [[alien species]]. Since only very few mammals and other alien species have actually colonized the islands of the Neozealandia province over the millions of years, the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] on most of the islands, including those of New Zealand itself, have remained almost exactly the same as they were when the original Gondwana [[supercontinent]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/video2_films_regional_pacific.php Nature: Land of the Kiwi], ''PBS Video'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of [[tuatara]] species survive in small numbers on small islets adjacent to New Zealand. Also, New Zealand has vestiges of ancient [[temperate rain forest]]s with plant species, such as giant [[club moss]]es, [[tree ferns]] and ''[[Nothofagus]]'' trees, dating from the time when the Zealandia subcontinent split off from Gondwana. New Zealand grasslands are dominated by vast spreadings of [[tussock grass]] fed upon by the [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] ground parrots. Most of New Zealand's few mammals are like those frequenting Antarctic shores.

'''Neurocinema''' or '''Neurocinematics''' is how watching movies, or particular scenes from movies affect our brains, and the response the human brain gives to any given movie or scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, Uri et al. "Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film." Projections: Journal for Movies and Mind 2:1, Summer 2008: 1-26. &lt;http://hlab.princeton.edu/Papers/Hasson_Neurocinematics_2008.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term Neurocinema comes from neurologists who are studying which pieces of a film can have the most control over a viewer's brain.&lt;ref&gt;"BrainCraft", PBS Digital Studios. "How Movies Control Our Brain." Online Video Clip. ''YouTube''. Youtube, 18 Feb. 2015. Web. 3 Mar. 2015.&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyQYYLsXhqc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are conducted with viewers who are screened movies while being monitored in [[fMRI]] machines that map the brain's activity. Studies have shown that certain scenes in certain films stimulate different part of the brain in different ways. Gaining this knowledge is not only beneficial on a neuroscience level, but for filmmakers as well.
__TOC__

==History==
Although these studies began in the 2000s, this idea has been around since the early years of film. This is demonstrated with Sergei Eisenstein’s experiments with montage theory and Lev Kuleshov’s famous “[[Kuleshov effect|Kuleshov Effect]]”. These Russian filmmakers studied American filmmakers such as D.W. Griffith and discovered that film was a “malleable” art. The Kuleshov Effect proved that the juxtaposition of a series of images together can create ideas and emotions in an audience’s mind. This revolutionized propaganda in the Soviet Union to spread the influence the collective strength of a new Marxist state after the revolution of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giannetti|first1=Louis|last2=Eyman|first2=Scott|title=Flashback: A Brief History of Film|date=July 24, 2009|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0205695906|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea has grown ever since. Alfred Hitchcock referred to this idea of film saying, “[Film] creation is based on an exact science of audience reactions”.&lt;ref&gt;"BrainCraft", PBS Digital Studios. "How Movies Control Our Brain." Online Video Clip. ''YouTube''. Youtube, 18 Feb. 2015. Web. 3 Mar. 2015.&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyQYYLsXhqc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He said this long before MRI technology was even fathomable. In more recent years marketing agencies have had their foot in the door with these studies in terms of [[neuromarketing]]. They use “fMRI, EEG, galvanic skin response, eye-tracking and other biometric approaches” to screen trailers to show studios and production companies how to best market a film for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Kevin. "Rise of Neurocinema: How Hollywood Studios Harness Your Brainwaves to Win Oscars." Fast Company. 25 Feb. 2011. Web. 3 Apr. 2015. &lt;http://www.fastcompany.com/1731055/rise-neurocinema-how-hollywood-studios-harness-your-brainwaves-win-oscars&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
These studies are conducted with viewers’ laying on their backs with a mirror above them. Movies are projected onto those mirrors and sound is transmitted by the subjects wearing high-fidelity MRI compatible headphones. As the viewers’ watch these films they are being monitored in fMRI machines that map the brains activity. When the studies are conducted the participants are told they can look where ever they please, which is referred to as “free-viewing”, and they were told they could stop the study at any point. All the participants in the study had similar eye movement and stimulation in areas of the brain when shown certain movies, scenes or clips of video regardless of the “free-viewing” method that was in place. This was documented by a new method of “Inter-Subject Correlation” in which they mapped the brain activity of the participants and aligned them over the same timeline.&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, Uri et al. "Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film." Projections: Journal for Movies and Mind 2:1, Summer 2008: 1-26. &lt;http://hlab.princeton.edu/Papers/Hasson_Neurocinematics_2008.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Application==
[[Peter Katz]], working with MindSign Neuromarketing is another group involved in the neurological studies of film. He and his team are bringing this “current market research” by focusing on specific genre’s to gain an understanding of how directors could affect an audience’s subconscious mind. For example, in the horror genre, MRI used to view activity in the amygdala to look for fear, anger, rage and fight or flight type emotions. By using information obtained from MRIs they can determine exactly what scenes and even specific images invoke an emotional response, or the opposite. The potential for this kind of information is that it can be more accurate than forms filled out at the end of test screenings since the data is recorded in the moment, and is recording how they the subjects are subconsciously reacting, as opposed to how they consciously perceive they are reacting.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Curtis. "Neurocinema Aims to Change the Way Movies Are Made." WIRED. Condé Nast, 23 Sept. 2009. Web. 31 Mar. 2015. &lt;http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/neurocinema-aims-to-change-the-way-movies-are-made/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotic]] analysis (the studies of signs or symbols), an '''open text''' is a text that allows multiple or mediated [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]] by the readers.  In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.

The concept of the '''open text''' comes from [[Umberto Eco]]'s collection of essays ''The Role of the Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;Eco, U., 1984,The Role of the Reader: Explorations in the Semiotics of Texts, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also derivative of [[Roland Barthes]]'s distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, "[[The Death of the Author]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, R., 1977, 'The Death of the Author' in Image-Music-Text, Fontana&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
In this essay, [[Umberto Eco]] describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of "open works" to literary texts and other works of art.

Every work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the [[Anagoge|anagogical]]. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.

The reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] , which are "open" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.

[[Umberto Eco]] makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are "open" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of "openness" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)

This kind of "openness" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.

He continues by comparing open works to [[Quantum mechanics]], and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges  the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.

Every work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a "work in movement", an "open work" and still a "work in progress".

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]], e.g. [[mole fraction]] or [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]. Since these [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] are quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated [[units of measurement]]. Commonly used are '''ppm''' (parts-per-million, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppb''' (parts-per-billion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}}), '''ppt''' (parts-per-[[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]], {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and '''ppq''' (parts-per-quadrillion, {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;}}). This notation is not part of the SI system and its meaning is ambiguous.

==Overview==
Parts-per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in [[chemistry]], for instance, the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity “1&amp;nbsp;ppm” can be used for a mass fraction if a water-borne pollutant is present at one-millionth of a [[gram]] per gram of sample solution. When working with aqueous solutions, it is common to assume that the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Therefore, it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 L of water. Consequently, 1 ppm corresponds to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 μg/L.

Similarly, parts-per notation is used also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]] to express the value of various proportional phenomena. For instance, a special metal alloy might expand 1.2 [[micrometre|micrometers]] per [[metre|meter]] of length for every [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] and this would be expressed as “''[[Coefficient of thermal expansion|α]]''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.2&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C.” Parts-per notation is also employed to denote the change, stability, or [[Standard deviation|uncertainty]] in measurements. For instance, the accuracy of land-survey distance measurements when using a [[laser rangefinder]] might be 1&amp;nbsp;millimeter per kilometer of distance; this could be expressed as “[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm.”&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplified explanation. Laser rangefinders typically have a measurement [[granularity]] of one to ten millimeters; thus, the complete specification for distance measurement accuracy might read as follows:&amp;nbsp; Accuracy: ±(1&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;ppm). Consequently, a distance measurement of only a few meters would still have an accuracy of ±1&amp;nbsp;mm in this example.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]: in mathematical expressions, the units of measurement always cancel. In fractions like “2 nanometers per meter” (2&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;ppb&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;000&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;001)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with positive values less than&amp;nbsp;1. When parts-per notations, including the [[percent]] symbol (%), are used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expressions), they are still pure-number dimensionless quantities. However, they generally take the literal “parts per” meaning of a comparative ratio (e.g., “2&amp;nbsp;ppb” would generally be interpreted as “two parts in a billion parts”).&lt;ref name="BIPM"&gt;BIPM: [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3-7.html 5.3.7 ''Stating values of dimensionless quantities, or quantities of dimension one]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts-per notations may be expressed in terms of any unit of the same measure. For instance, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of a certain [[brass]] alloy, ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.7&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C, may be expressed as 18.7&amp;nbsp;([[Micrometre|µm]]/m)/°C, or as 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µ[[Inch|in]]/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure.&lt;ref&gt;In the particular case of coefficient of thermal expansion, the change to inches (one of the [[United States customary units|U.S. customary units]]) is typically also accompanied by a change to [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]]. Since a Fahrenheit-sized interval of temperature is only {{frac|5|9}} that of a Celsius-sized interval, the value is typically expressed as 10.4&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°F rather than 18.7&amp;nbsp;(µin/in)/°C.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a [[metering pump]] that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate ''[[Volumetric flow rate|Q]]&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;125&amp;nbsp;ppm, is doing so at a rate that may be expressed in a variety of volumetric units, including 125&amp;nbsp;µL/L, 125&amp;nbsp;µ[[Gallon|gal]]/gal, 125&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], etc.

===In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy===

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), [[chemical shift]] is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.

==Parts-per expressions==&lt;!-- This specific section is linked from [[Uranium]] and other articles; please do not rename this section. In the following equivalencies, it is assumed that one xxxx of water has a volume of 0.05 ml (20 xxxx per milliliter).--&gt;
{{visualisation_parts_per.svg}}
*''One part per [[100 (number)|hundred]]'' is generally represented by the [[percent sign]] (%) and denotes one part [[percentage|per 100 parts]], one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about fifteen minutes out of one day.
{{anchor|Thousand}}
*''One part per [[thousand]]'' should generally be spelled out in full and '''not''' as "ppt" (which is usually understood to represent "parts per trillion"). It may also be denoted by the [[per mille|permille]] sign (‰). Note however, that specific disciplines such as oceanography, as well as educational exercises, do use the "ppt" abbreviation. "One part per thousand" denotes one part per 1000 parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about one and a half minutes out of one day.
*''One part per [[ten thousand]]'' is denoted by the [[Basis point#Permyriad|permyriad]] sign (‱). Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per {{val|10000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day.&lt;br&gt;In contrast, in [[finance]], the [[basis point]] is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates (although it can also be used in other cases where it is desirable to express quantities in hundredths of a percent). For instance, a change in an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points (per annum).&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS:

Unlike the % symbol, which constitutes a formatting exception to the rule of the SI, a space goes between the value and both the permille and permyriad symbols (‰ and {{unicode|‱}}). Besides adhering to the rule of the SI, this is also good technical writing practice as it helps to distinguish these two less-common symbols from the percent symbol.

--&gt; As with interest rates, the words "per annum" (or "per year") are often omitted. In that case, the basis point is a quantity with a dimension of (time&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/basis-points-bps-definition/|title=What are Basis Points (BPS)?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''One part per [[million]]'' ('''ppm''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000}}}} × 100% = 0.0001% (or 1% = {{val|10000}} ppm), and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year; in [[distance measurement]], it is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;mm of error per km of distance traversed.
{{anchor|ppb}}
*''One part per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]'' ('''ppb''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, {{sfrac|{{val|1000000000}}}} × 100% = {{val|0.0000001}}% (or 1% = {{val|10000000}} ppb) and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about three seconds out of a [[century]].
{{anchor|ppt}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]'' ('''ppt''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about thirty seconds out of every million years.
{{anchor|ppq}}
*''One part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]]'' ('''ppq''') denotes one part per {{val|1000000000000000}} parts, one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, and a value of 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;. This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the [[age of the Earth]] (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed.&lt;ref&gt;
Measurements of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] are routinely made at the ''sub''-ppq level. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) currently sets a hard limit of 30&amp;nbsp;ppq for dioxin in drinking water but once recommended a voluntary limit of 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq. Also, radioactive contaminants in drinking water, which are quantified by measuring their radiation, are often reported in terms of ppq; 0.013&amp;nbsp;ppq is equivalent to the thickness of a sheet of paper versus a journey of {{val|146000}} trips around the world.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE REGARDING {{val|146000}} TRIPS AROUND THE WORLD:

The analogy of paper thickness vs. 146k trips around the world may be so wildly counterintuitive that the statement might seemingly be in error, but please do not change the statement without first understanding the below math (shown here with excess precision):

Paper thickness = 0.0030 inch = 0.0000762 m (0.003 × 25.4 mm/inch ÷ 1000 mm/m)
Earth’s mean circumference = 40,041,470 m

In then follows that…
[[Image:Image-Olympic Pool Munich 1972, color adj.jpg|thumb|right|300px|One part per trillion (1 ppt) is a proportion equivalent to a drop of water diluted into 400 [[Olympic-size swimming pool]]s.]]

In [[science]] and [[engineering]], the '''parts-per notation''' is a set of pseudo-units to describe

146,386.7 trips × 40,041,470 m × 0.013E-15 = 0.0000762 m = 0.0030 inch = paper thickness

== Criticism ==

Although the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (an international standards organization known also by its [[France|French]]-language initials BIPM) recognizes the use of parts-per notation, it is not formally part of the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt; Note that although “[[Percentage|percent]]” (%) is not formally part of the SI, both the BIPM and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] take the position that ''“in mathematical expressions, the internationally recognized symbol % (percent) may be used with the SI to represent the number 0.01”'' for dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantities and units'' - Part 0: ''General principles'', ISO 31-0:1992.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]], ''“a continued source of annoyance to unit purists has been the continued use of percent, ppm, ppb, and ppt.”''&lt;ref name="IUPAP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on recent Committee activities on behalf of IUPAP to the 1999 IUPAP General Assembly |author-first=Brian W. |author-last=Petley |date=September 1998 |url=http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html&lt;!-- http://www.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html --&gt; |access-date=2017-08-15 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815113700/http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/interunion/iu14/ga-99.html |archive-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[#SI-compliant expressions|SI-compliant expressions]] should be used as an alternative, the parts-per notation remains nevertheless widely used in technical disciplines. The main problems with the parts-per notation are the following:

=== Long and short scales ===

Because the [[Names of large numbers|named numbers]] starting with a “[[Long and short scales|billion]]” have different values in different countries, the BIPM suggests avoiding the use of “ppb” and “ppt” to prevent misunderstanding. The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) takes the stringent position, stating that ''“the language-dependent terms [ .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ] are not acceptable for use with the SI to express the values of quantities.”''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.3em"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIST: ''[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.10.3 Rules and Style Conventions for Expressing Values of Quantities: 7.10.3 ppm, ppb, and ppt]''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Thousand vs. trillion ===

Although "ppt" usually means "parts per trillion", it occasionally means "parts per thousand". Unless the meaning of "ppt" is defined explicitly, it has to be determined from the context.

=== Mass fraction vs. mole fraction vs. volume fraction ===

Another problem of the parts-per notation is that it may refer to [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], [[mole fraction]] or [[volume fraction]]. Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the unit as kg/kg, mol/mol or m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (even though they are all dimensionless).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and it is very important to specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas [[CFC-11]] in air. For volume fraction, the suffix "V" or "v" is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation (e.g., ppmV, ppbv, pptv).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA On-line Tools for Site Assessment Calculation: Indoor Air Unit Conversion|url=http://www.epa.gov/athens/learn2model/part-two/onsite/ia_unit_conversion.html|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton R. Beychok|title=Fundamentals of Stack Gas Dispersion|url=http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html|article=Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas|publisher=Milton R. Beychok|edition=4th|isbn=0964458802|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, ppbv and pptv are also often used for mole fractions (which is identical to volume fraction only for ideal gases).

To distinguish the mass fraction from volume fraction or mole fraction, the letter w (standing for weight) is sometimes added to the abbreviation (e.g., ppmw, ppbw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Introduction to Green Engineering|url=https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/CE_2050_F12/2012/08/23/units/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the parts-per notation is generally quite fixed inside most specific branches of science, leading some researchers to draw the conclusion that their own usage (mass/mass, mol/mol, volume/volume, or others) is the only correct one. This, in turn, leads them to not specify their usage in their publications, and others may therefore misinterpret their results. For example, [[electrochemistry|electrochemists]] often use volume/volume, while [[Chemical engineering|chemical engineers]] may use mass/mass as well as volume/volume. Many academic papers of otherwise excellent level fail to specify their usage of the parts-per notation.

Note that the notations in the “SI units” column above are all [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]; that is, the units of measurement factor out in expressions like “1&amp;nbsp;nm/m” (1&amp;nbsp;n&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;/&lt;s&gt;m&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;nano&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) so the [[quotient]]s are pure-number [[coefficient]]s with values less than 1.

==Uno==
Because of the cumbersome nature of expressing certain dimensionless quantities per SI guidelines, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed the adoption of the special name "uno" (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities.&lt;ref name="IUPAP"/&gt; This symbol is not to be confused with the always-italicized symbol for the variable "uncertainty" (symbol: ''U''). This unit name "uno" and its symbol could be used in combination with the [[SI prefix]]es to express the values of dimensionless quantities that are much less—or even ''greater''—than one.&lt;ref&gt;Certain mathematical functions can produce proportional quantities with values greater than 1.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parts-per notations in terms of the uno are given in the table below.

In 2004, a report to the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (known also by its French-language initials CIPM) stated that response to the proposal of the uno "had been almost entirely negative" and the principal proponent "recommended dropping the idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of the 16th meeting (13–14 May 2004) to the International Committee for Weights and Measures, of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |author=Consultative Committee for Units |date=13–14 May 2004 |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310054340/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the uno has not been adopted by any [[standards organization]] and it appears unlikely it will ever become an officially sanctioned way to express low-value (high-ratio) dimensionless quantities. The proposal was instructive, however, as to the perceived shortcomings of the current options for denoting dimensionless quantities.

==Improper applications==
Parts-per notation may properly be used only to express true dimensionless quantities; that is, the units of measurement ''must'' cancel in expressions like "1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" so that the quotients are pure numbers with values less than 1. Mixed-unit quantities such as "a [[radon]] concentration of 15&amp;nbsp;p[[Curie|Ci]]/[[Litre|L]]" are not dimensionless quantities and may not be expressed using any form of parts-per notation, such as "15&amp;nbsp;ppt". Other examples of measures that are not dimensionless quantities are as follows:

* [[Particulate|Particulate matter]] in the air: 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; not 50&amp;nbsp;ppb.
* A [[stepper motor]]/gear system that produces a motion of 1&amp;nbsp;µm/pulse; not 1&amp;nbsp;ppm
* Mercury vapor concentration in air: 0.6&amp;nbsp;ng/[[Litre|L]]; not 0.6&amp;nbsp;ppt&lt;!--EDITORS NOTE: This example intentionally juxtaposes nano (one billionth) and ppt (parts per trillion) rather than ppb, as a lead-in to the below discussion regarding how what is commonly done with aqueous concentrations (where one liter of water has a mass of 1 kg) may not be done with air.--&gt;

Note however, that it is not uncommon to express aqueous concentrations—particularly in drinking-water reports intended for the general public—using parts-per notation (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm, 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppb, etc.) and further, for those reports to state that the notations denote milligrams per [[Litre|liter]] or micrograms per liter. Although "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L" is not a dimensionless quantity, it is assumed in scientific circles that "2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg" (2.1&amp;nbsp;ppm) is the true measure because one liter of water has a mass of about one kilogram. The goal in all [[technical writing]] (including drinking-water reports for the general public) is to clearly communicate to the intended audience with minimal confusion. Drinking water is intuitively a volumetric quantity in the public’s mind so measures of contamination expressed on a per-liter basis are considered to be easier to grasp. Still, it is technically possible, for example, to "dissolve" more than one liter of a very hydrophilic chemical in 1 liter of water; parts-per notation would be confusing when describing its solubility in water (greater than a million parts per million), so one would simply state the volume (or mass) that will dissolve into a liter, instead.

When reporting air-borne rather than water-borne densities, a slightly different convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water. In water, 1&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air, it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion. Note also, that in the case of air, this convention is much less accurate. Whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1&amp;nbsp;kg, one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143&amp;nbsp;kg—much less accurate, but still close enough for many practical uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Passion Dust Intimacy Capsules''' are a [[novelty]] [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] product, introduced in 2017, that consists of capsules full of small, glittering particles that are intended to be inserted into the [[vagina]] before sex. The product is advertised as making the female genitalia "look, feel and taste soft, sweet and magical", but its use may carry serious health risks.&lt;ref name="The Independent 4 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Sarah|title=Don’t put glitter in your vagina, gynaecologists warn|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-glitter-vaginas-trend-doctors-warn-health-candy-scent-passion-dust-pretty-woman-inc-discharge-a7822461.html|accessdate=12 July 2017|work=The Independent|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phases Venus.jpg|thumb|right|The evolution of the [[apparent diameter]] and [[phases of Venus]]]]

A '''planetary phase''' is a certain portion of a [[planet]]'s area that [[diffuse reflection|reflects]] [[sunlight]] as viewed from a given vantage point, as well as the period of time during which it occurs.

==Inferior planets==
The two [[inferior planet]]s, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], which have orbits that are smaller than the Earth's, exhibit the full range of phases as does the Moon, when seen through a telescope. Their phases are "full" when they are at [[Conjunction (astronomy)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]], on the far side of the Sun as seen from the Earth. (It is possible to see them at these times, since their orbits are not exactly in the plane of Earth's orbit, so they usually appear to pass slightly above or below the Sun in the sky. Seeing them from the Earth's surface is difficult, because of sunlight scattered in Earth's atmosphere, but observers in space can see them easily if direct sunlight is blocked from reaching the observer's eyes.) The planets' phases are "new" when they are at inferior conjunction, passing more or less between the Sun and the Earth. (Sometimes they appear to cross the solar disk, which is called a [[Astronomical transit|transit]] of the planet.) At intermediate points on their orbits, these planets exhibit the full range of crescent and gibbous phases.

==Superior planets==
The superior planets, orbiting outside the Earth's orbit, do not exhibit the full range of phases as they appear almost always as gibbous or full. However, [[Mars]] often appears significantly gibbous, when it is illuminated by the Sun at a very different angle than it is seen by an observer on Earth, so an observer on Mars would see the Sun and the Earth widely separated in the sky. This effect is not easily noticeable for the [[giant planet]]s, from [[Jupiter]] outward, since they are so far away that the Sun and the Earth, as seen from these outer planets, would appear to be in almost the same direction.

The '''Tehran Monolingual Corpus''' (TMC) is a large-scale Persian monolingual corpus. TMC is suited for [[Language model|Language Modeling]] and relevant research areas in [[Natural Language Processing]].

The corpus is extracted from [[Hamshahri Corpus]] and [[Iranian Students News Agency|ISNA news agency]] website. The quality of Hamshahri corpus is improved for language modeling purpose by a series of [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]] and spell-checking steps.

TMC comprises more than 250 million words. The total number of unique words (with frequency of two or more) of the corpus is about 300 thousand, which is relatively good for a highly-inflectional language like Persian.

TMC is created by Natural Language Processing Lab of [[University of Tehran]]. The corpus is free for research use, after obtaining permission from the corpus aggregator.

==Background==
Among the most fundamental characteristics of a [[protein]] are the N- and C-termini defining the start and end of the [[peptide|polypeptide chain]]. While genetically encoded, protein termini isoforms are also often generated during [[translation (biology)|translation]], following which, termini are highly dynamic, being frequently trimmed at their ends by a large array of exopeptidases. Neo-termini can also be generated by endopeptidases after precise and limited proteolysis, termed processing. Necessary for the maturation of many proteins, processing can also occur afterwards, often resulting in dramatic functional consequences. Aberrant proteolysis can cause wide range of diseases like arthritis&lt;ref name="pmid21120997"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cox JH, Starr AE, Kappelhoff R, Yan R, Roberts CR, Overall CM|title=Matrix metalloproteinase 8 deficiency in mice exacerbates inflammatory arthritis through delayed neutrophil apoptosis and reduced caspase 11 expression |journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=3645–3655 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21120997 |doi=10.1002/art.27757 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid16498445"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Overall CM, Kleifeld O|title=Tumour microenvironment - opinion: validating matrix metalloproteinases as drug targets and anti-targets for cancer therapy |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=227–239 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16498445 |url= |doi=10.1038/nrc1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, proteolytic generation of pleiotrophic stable forms of proteins, the universal susceptibility of proteins to proteolysis, and its irreversibility, distinguishes proteolysis from many highly studied posttranslational modifications.

==Knowledgebase content==
TopFIND is a resource for comprehensive coverage of protein N- and C-termini discovered by all available in silico, in vitro as well as in vivo methodologies. It makes use of existing knowledge by seamless integration of data from [[UniProt]] and [[MEROPS]] and provides access to new data from community submission and manual literature curating. It renders modifications of [[protein]] termini, such as acetylation and citrullination, easily accessible and searchable and provides the means to identify and analyse extend and distribution of terminal modifications across a protein. Since its inception TopFIND has been expanded to further species.&lt;ref name="pmid22102574" /&gt;

==Data access==
The data is presented to the user with a strong emphasis on the relation to curated background information and underlying evidence that led to the observation of a terminus, its modification or proteolytic cleavage. In brief the [[protein]] information, its domain structure, protein termini, terminus modifications and proteolytic processing of and by other proteins is listed. All information is accompanied by [[metadata]] like its original source, method of identification, confidence measurement or related publication. A positional cross correlation evaluation matches termini and cleavage sites with protein features (such as amino acid variants) and domains to highlight potential effects and dependencies in a unique way. Also, a network view of all proteins showing their functional dependency as [[protease]], [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] or [[Protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] tied in with [[Protein–protein interaction|protein interactions]] is provided for the easy evaluation of network wide effects. A powerful yet user friendly filtering mechanism allows the presented data to be filtered based on parameters like methodology used, in vivo relevance, confidence or data source (e.g. limited to a single laboratory or publication). This provides means to assess physiological relevant data and to deduce functional information and hypotheses relevant to the bench scientist.  In a later release analysis tools for the evaluation of proteolytic pathways in experimental data have been added.&lt;ref name="pmid25332401"&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">'''Tyndallization''' is a process dating from the nineteenth century for [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] substances, usually food, named after its inventor, scientist [[John Tyndall]], that can be used to kill heat-resistant [[endospore]]s. Although considered old-fashioned, it is still occasionally used.
 
A simple and effective sterilizing method commonly used today is [[Autoclave|autoclaving]]: heating the substance being sterilized to 121 °C for 15 minutes in a pressured system. If autoclaving is not possible because of lack of equipment, or the need to sterilize something that will not withstand the higher temperature, unpressurized heating for a prolonged period at a temperature of up to 100 °C, the boiling point of water, may be used. The heat will kill the [[bacteria|bacterial cells]]; however, [[bacterial spores]] capable of later germinating into bacterial cells may survive. Tyndallization can be used to destroy the spores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umsl.edu/microbes/files/pdfs/tyndallization.pdf Tyndallization] briefly explained in a short tutorial about [https://www.umsl.edu/microbes/Techniques%20and%20Troubleshooting/index.html techniques and troubleshooting for dealing with microbes in a science lab].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyndallization essentially consists of heating the substance to boiling point (or just a little below boiling point) and holding it there for 15 minutes, three days in succession. After each heating, the resting period will allow spores that have survived to germinate into bacterial cells; these cells will be killed by the next day's heating. During the resting periods the substance being sterilized is kept in a moist environment at a warm room temperature, conducive to germination of the spores. When the environment is favourable for bacteria, it is conducive to the germination of cells from spores, and spores do not form from cells in this environment (see [[bacterial spores]]).

The Tyndallization process is usually effective in practice. But it is not considered totally reliable—some spores may survive and later germinate and multiply. It is not often used today, but is used for sterilizing some things that cannot withstand pressurized heating, such as plant seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould GW |title=History of science--spores |journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16523">[[Image:Annales Veteris Testamenti page 1.jpg|thumb|''Annales Veteris Testamenti'' page 1 (Latin)]]
[[Image:Annals of the World page 1.jpg|thumb|''Annals of the World'' page 1 (English)]]

The '''Ussher chronology''' is a 17th-century [[chronology]] of the [[history]] of the world [[Biblical literalist chronology|formulated from a literal reading]] of the [[Old Testament]] by [[James Ussher]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The chronology is sometimes associated with [[young Earth creationism]], which holds that the Universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the [[Books of the Bible|biblical book]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].  Ussher fell into disrepute in the 19th century.

Published in 1650, the full title of Ussher's work in Latin is ''Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the beginnings of [[Maccabees]]").

Ussher's work was his contribution to the long-running theological debate on the age of the [[Earth]]. This was a major concern of many [[Christian]] scholars over the centuries.

The chronology is sometimes called the Ussher{{endash}}Lightfoot chronology because [[John Lightfoot]] published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that the first day of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] fell upon, October 23, 4004&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], near the [[autumnal equinox]]. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.

Ussher's proposed date of [[4004 BC]] differed little from [[Dating Creation#Date of Creation according to the Pentateuch|other Biblically-based estimates]], such as those of [[Jose ben Halafta]] (3761 BC), [[Bede]] (3952 BC), Ussher's near-contemporary [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]] (3949 BC), [[Johannes Kepler]] (3992 BC) or [[Sir Isaac Newton]] (c. 4000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Hay|title=Experimenting on a Small Planet: A Scholarly Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teJYlWH9vg4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=November 17, 2013|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642285608|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2017}} Ussher was influenced by the same account as the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], dating the worldwide flood to 2349 BC and the birth of [[Terah]] in 2127 BC. The date of 4000 BC as the creation of [[Adam]] was at least partially influenced by the widely held belief that the Earth was approximately 5600 years old (2000 to Abraham, 2000 from Abraham to the birth of [[Christ (title)|Christ]], and 1600 years from Christ to Ussher), corresponding to the six days of Creation, on the grounds that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|3:8|KJV}}). This tradition was believed to indicate that Jesus would return in 2000 AD,&lt;ref name="Newport2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth G. C. Newport|title=Apocalypse and millennium: studies in biblical eisegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Cm9ALJbe0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=28 August 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77334-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RowlandBarton2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Rowland|author2=John Barton|title=Apocalyptic in history and tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrcoAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=978-0-8264-6208-4|pages=233–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than six thousand years after 4004 BC. Modern proponents of this interpretation hold that the creation date 4004 BC could be inaccurate.

==Ussher's methods==
The chronologies of Ussher and other biblical scholars corresponded so closely because they used much the same methodology to calculate key events recorded in the [[Bible]]. Establishing the chronologies is complicated by the fact that the Bible was compiled by different authors over several centuries with lengthy chronological gaps, making it difficult to do a simple totaling of Biblical ages and dates. In his article on Ussher's calendar, James Barr has identified three distinct periods that Ussher and others had to tackle:&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:'''603–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "''Creation to Abraham's migration.''" This section is fairly easy to calculate, using the chronological data in Genesis 5 and 11, which gives an unbroken male lineage, with dates, from the creation to Abraham being called out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ussher uses the chronology found in the Masoretic text instead of the alternative chronologies found in the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch. Ussher fixed this period as 2082 years, from 4004 to 1922 BC.
# ''"Abraham's migration to Solomon's temple."'' Ussher wrote the time from Abram leaving Haran to the Exodus was 430 years (400 years of persecution, 30 years after left Haran) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/AnnalsOfTheWorld/Annals#page/n23/mode/2up|title=Annals of the World|last=Ussher|first=James|publisher=|year=1650|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse||1 Kings|6|KJV}} gives 480 years from the Exodus to the beginning of Solomon's temple in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. These 910 years span from 1922 to 1012 BC.
# ''"Period of the temple laid to the Babylonian captivity."'' This period is the most difficult to calculate, due to repeated difficulties in correlating the regnal years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The simple addition of the reigns of Judah's kings gives 430 years, but by positing a few overlapping reigns, Ussher shortens this to 424 years: 1012 to 588 BC.

After reckoning the years from creation to the last kings of Judah, Ussher used {{bibleverse|2 Kings|25:27}} to establish the length of time from the creation to the accession of Babylonian king Amel-Marduk (also known as Evil-Merodach).&lt;ref name="barr-marduk"&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 579-580.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used information from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sources to fix the date of Amel-Marduk's enthronment at 562 BC (after Nebuchadnezzar's death), from which he was able to deduce a creation in 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="barr-marduk" /&gt;

In fixing the date of Jesus' birth, Ussher took account of an error perpetrated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]], the founder of the [[Anno Domini]] numbering system. Ussher chose 5 BC as Christ's birth year&lt;ref name=Epistle/&gt; because [[Josephus]] indicated that the death of [[Herod the Great]] occurred in 4 BC.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Pratt, [http://www.johnpratt.com/items/docs/herod/herod.html "Yet another eclipse for Herod"], ''The Planetarian'', vol. 19, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the Gospel of Matthew to be correct, Jesus could not have been born after that date.

The season in which Creation occurred was the subject of considerable [[theology|theological]] debate in Ussher's time. Many scholars proposed it had taken place in the spring, the start of the Babylonian, Chaldean and other cultures' chronologies. Others, including Ussher, thought it more likely that it had occurred in the [[autumn]], largely because that season marked the beginning of the Jewish year.

Ussher further narrowed down the date by using the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] to establish the "first day" of creation as falling on a Sunday near the autumnal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 591.&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the week was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish calendar is Saturday—hence, Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s ''Tabulae Rudolphinae'' (''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday, October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:16|KJV}}. Modern equations place the autumnal equinox of 4004 BC on Sunday, October 23 (by the Julian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html Calendrica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |date=2005-02-16 }} The position of the Sun at the autumnal equinox is 180°, where 0° is its position at the vernal equinox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's understanding of creation placed the "first day" referred to in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|KJV}} on October 23, but with a "pre-creation" event, which he identified as the "beginning of time" occurring the previous night.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Ussher referred to his dating of creation on the first page of ''Annales'' in Latin and on the first page of its English translation ''Annals of the World'' (1658). In the following extract from the English translation, the phrase "in the year of the Julian Calendar" refers to the Julian Period, of which year 1 is 4713 BC, and therefore year 710 is 4004 BC.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Ge. 1:1 This beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year of the Julian Calendar, 710.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ussher provides a slightly different time in his "Epistle to the Reader" in his Latin and English works:&lt;ref name=Epistle&gt;James Ussher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrHER1jYzhIC&amp;pg=PA9 "Epistle to the Reader"], ''Annals of the World'' (2003) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "I deduce that the time from the creation until midnight, January 1, 1 AD was 4003 years, seventy days and six hours." Six hours before midnight would be 6 pm.

==Ussher's chronology today==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century, Ussher's chronology came under increasing attack from supporters of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], who argued that Ussher's "young Earth" was incompatible with the increasingly accepted view of an Earth much more ancient than Ussher's.  It became generally accepted that the Earth was tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. Ussher fell into disrepute among [[theology|theologian]]s as well; in 1890, Princeton professor [[William Henry Green]] wrote a highly influential article in ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' entitled "Primeval Chronology" in which he strongly criticised Ussher. He concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We conclude that the Scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of Abraham; and that the Mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the Flood or of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-5-the-decree-of-creation/primeval-chronology-by-dr-william-henry-green/ Primeval Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarly conservative theologian [[B. B. Warfield]] reached the same conclusion in "On The Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race",&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Theological Review'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; commenting that "it is precarious in the highest degree to draw chronological inferences from genealogical tables".

Nevertheless, Professor [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] (then Oriel Professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University) wrote in 1984:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
…probably, so far as I know, there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1–11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that… the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story…&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, Oriel professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University, England, in a letter to David C. C. Watson, April 23, 1984. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archbishop Ussher's chronology has in recent years been subject to artistic criticism, including in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (based on the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]) and the [[fantasy]] novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' which alleges that "he is off by a quarter of an hour". A different viewpoint comes from [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who, while totally disagreeing with Ussher's chronology, nevertheless wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | title = Fall in the House of Ussher | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould]] | journal = Natural History | volume = 100 |date = November 1991 | pages = 12–21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303202324/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | archivedate = March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall be defending Ussher's chronology as an honorable effort for its time and arguing that our usual ridicule only records a lamentable small-mindedness based on mistaken use of present criteria to judge a distant and different past
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ussher represented the best of scholarship in his time. He was part of a substantial research tradition, a large community of intellectuals working toward a common goal under an accepted methodology…
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Wet process engineering''' is one of the major streams in [[textile engineering]] which refers to the process of textile chemicals engineering and a few different aspects of [[applied science|applied sciences]] in this area. The three other original streams of this field are [[Spinning (textiles)|yarn engineering]], [[Textile manufacturing|fabric engineering]] and [[Clothing|apparel merchandising]]. 

Wet processing is usually done on the manufactured assembly of interlacing fibers, filaments, and/or yarns having substantial surface (planar) area in relation to its thickness, and adequate mechanical strength to give it a cohesive structure. In other words, wet process is done on manufactured fabric. The processes of this stream is involved or carried out in aqueous stage and thus it is called wet process which usually covers pre-treatment, dyeing, printing and finishing.

All of these stages are required aqueous medium which is created by water. A massive amount of water is required in these processes per day. It is estimated that, on an average, almost 100 liters of water is used to process only 1&amp;nbsp;kilogram of textile goods.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Water can be of various quality and attributes. Not all water can be used in this textile process, it must have some certain properties, quality, color and attributes for being used accurately. This is why water is a prime concern in the field of wet process engineering.

==Water==
Most water used in the textile industry is from deep well water which is found 800&amp;nbsp;ft below the surface level. The main problem which is concerned in using water in textile processes is [[water hardness]] caused by the presence of soluble salts of metals including [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]. Iron, aluminum and copper salts may also contribute to the hardness, but their effects are much less. Using hard water in wet process can cause problems such as the formation of [[limescale|scale]] in boilers, reactions with soap and detergents, reaction with dyes and problems due to Iron.

Water hardness can be removed by boiling process, liming process, [[sodalime]] process, base exchange process or synthetic ion exchange process. Recently some companies have started harvesting rain water for use in wet processes as it is less likely to cause the problems associated with water hardness.

== Pre-treatment ==
Wet process engineering is the most significant division in the textile preparation and processing. It is a major stream in textile engineering which is under the section of textile chemical processing engineering and applied science. Textile manufacturing covers everything from fiber to apparel; covering with yarn, fabric, [[Dyeing|fabric dyeing]], printing, finishing, garments or apparel manufacturing. There are many variable processes available at the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the finishing and coloration processes to the production of a wide ranges of products.

In [[Bangladesh]], textile manufacturing is a major industry. In this industry, wet processing plays a vital role in the area of pre-treatment, dyeing, printing and finishing of both fabrics and apparels. But coloration in fiber stage or yarn stage is also included in the wet processing division.

All the processes of this stream are carried out in an aqueous state or aqueous medium. The main processes of this section include:
* [[Singeing#Textiles|Singeing]]
* Desizing
* Scouring
* Bleaching
* Mercerizing 
* Dyeing
* Printing
* Finishing

===Singeing===
The process of singeing is carried out for the purpose of removing the loose hairy fibers protruding from the surface of the cloth, thereby giving it a smooth, even and clean looking face. Singeing is an essential process for the goods or textile material which will be subjected to mercerizing, dyeing and printing to obtain best results from these processes.
 
The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibers, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.  When done to fabrics containing [[cotton]], this results in increased wetability, better dyeing characteristics, improved reflection, no "frosty" appearance, a smoother surface, better clarity in printing, improved visibility of the fabric structure, less [[Textile pilling|pilling]] and decreased contamination through removal of fluff and lint.

Singeing machines can be of three types: plate singeing, roller singeing, or gas singeing. Gas singeing is widely used in the textile industry. In gas singeing, a flame comes into direct contact to the fabric and burn the protruding fiber. Here, flame height and fabric speed is the main concern to minimize the fabric damage.

Singeing is performed only in the woven fabric. But in case of knit fabric, similar process of singeing is known as biopolishing where enzyme is used to remove the protruding fibers.

Singeing is a mechanical process by which hairy, loose fibers are removed from the surface of the textile material either by heating or burning to make the material smoother and lustrous.

Importance: same to bio-polishing without point 5.

===Desizing===
[[Desizing]] is the process of removing sizing materials from the fabric, which is applied in order to increase the strength of the yarn which can withstand with the friction of [[loom]]. Fabric which has not been desized is very stiff and causes difficulty in its treatment with different solution in subsequent processes.

After singeing operation the sizing material is removed by making it water-soluble and washing it with warm water. Desizing can be done by either the hydrolytic method (rot steep, acid steep, enzymatic steep) or the oxidative method (chlorine, [[chloride]], [[bromite]], [[hydrogen peroxide]])

Depending on the [[sizing]] materials that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the sizing material. Enzymes are applied in the desizing process if [[starch]] is used as sizing materials. [[Carboxymethyl cellulose]] (CMC) and [[Poly vinyl alcohol]] (PVA) are often used as sizing materials.

===Scouring===
[[:wikt:scour|Scouring]] is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibers and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called [[Kier (industrial)|kiers]]. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids ([[saponification]]). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fiber. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibers are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.

The three main processes involved in the scouring are saponification, [[emulsification]] and detergency.

The main chemical reagent used in the cotton scouring is sodium hydroxide which converts saponifiable fats and oils into soaps, dissolves mineral matter and converts pectose and [[pectin]] into their soluble salts.

Another scouring chemical is detergent which is an emulsifying agent and removes dust and dirt particles from the fabric.

Since damage can be caused to the cotton substrate by sodium hydroxide. Due to this, and in order to reduce alkali content in the effluent, Bio-scouring is introduced in the scouring process in which biological agent is used, such as an enzyme.

===Bleaching===
[[Bleaching]] improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Being a vegetable fiber, cotton will be bleached using an [[oxidizing agent]], such as dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]] or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable. However, for white bed sheets and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.

Reductive bleaching is also carried out, using [[sodium hydrosulphite]]. Fibers like [[polyamide]], polyacrylics and polyacetates can be bleached using reductive bleaching technology.

After scouring and bleaching, [[Optical brightener|optical brightening agents]] (OBA), are applied to make the textile material appear more white. These OBAs are available in different tints such as blue, violet and red.

===Mercerizing===
[[Mercerization]] is a treatment for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric or yarns a [[lustrous]] appearance and strengthens them. The process is applied to cellulosic materials like cotton or hemp. A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with sodium hydroxide solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on greige cloth, or after bleaching.

==Dyeing==
[[Dyeing]] is the process of adding color to textile products like fibers, yarns, and fabrics. Dyeing is normally done in a special solution containing dyes and particular chemical material. After dyeing, dye molecules have uncut chemical bond with fiber molecules. The temperature and time controlling are two key factors in dyeing. There are mainly two classes of dye, natural and man-made.

=== Solution dyeing ===
Solution dyeing, also known as dope or spun dyeing, is the process of adding pigments or insoluble dyes to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye fibers, such as [[olefin]] fibers, and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent colorfastness properties. Because the color pigments become a part of the fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent colorfastness to light, washing, crocking (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.

Filament fibers that are produced using the wet spinning method can be dyed while the fibers are still in the coagulating bath. The dye penetration at this stage is high, as the fibers are still soft. This method is known as gel dyeing.

=== Fiber dyeing ===
Stock dyeing, top dyeing, and tow dyeing are used to dye fibers at various stages of the manufacturing process prior to the fibers being spun into yarns. The names refer to the stage at which the fiber is when it is dyed. All three are included under the broad category of fiber dyeing.

Stock dyeing is dyeing raw fibers, also called stock, before they are aligned, blended, and spun into yarns.

Top dyeing is dyeing worsted wool fibers after they have been combed to straighten and remove the short fibers. The wool fiber at this stage is known as top. Top dyeing is preferred for worsted wools as the dye does not have to be wasted on the short fibers that are removed during the combing process.

Tow dyeing is dyeing filament fibers before they are cut into short staple fibers. The filament fibers at this stage are known as tow.

The dye penetration is excellent in fiber dyeing, therefore the amount of dye used to dye at this stage is also higher. Fiber dyeing is comparatively more costly than yarn, fabric, and product dyeing. The decision regarding the selection of colors has to be made early in the manufacturing process. Fiber dyeing is typically used to dye wool and other fibers that are used to produce yarns with two or more colors. Fibers for tweeds and fabrics with a “heather” look are often fiber dyed.

=== Yarn dyeing ===
[[Yarn]] dyeing adds color at the yarn stage. Skein, package, beam, and space dyeing methods are used to dye yarns.

In skein dyeing the yarns are loosely wound into hanks or skein and then dyed. The yarns have good dye penetration, but the process is slow and comparatively more expensive.

In package dyeing yarns that have been wound on perforated spools are dyed in a pressurized tank. The process is comparatively faster, but the dye uniformity may not be as good as that of skein dyed yarn.

In beam dyeing a perforated warp beam is used instead of the spools used in package dyeing.

Space dyeing is used to produce yarns with multiple colors.

In general, yarn dyeing provides adequate color absorption and penetration for most materials. Thick and highly twisted yarns may not have good dye penetration. This process is typically used when different colored yarns are used in the construction of fabrics (e.g. plaids, checks, iridescent fabrics).

=== Fabric dyeing ===
Fabric dyeing, also known as piece dyeing, is dyeing fabric after it has been constructed. It is economical and the most common method of dyeing solid colored fabrics. The decision regarding color can be made after the fabric has been manufactured. Thus, it is suitable for quick response orders. Dye penetration may not be good in thicker fabrics, so yarn dyeing is sometimes used to dye thick fabrics in solid colors. Various types of dyeing machines are used for piece dyeing. The selection of the equipment is based on factors such as dye and fabric characteristics, cost, and the intended end use.

==== Union dyeing ====
Union dyeing is "a method of dyeing a fabric containing two or more types of fibers or yarns to the same shade so as to achieve the appearance of a solid colored fabric".&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Fiber &amp; Textile Technology | publisher=KoSa | year=1999 | isbn=9780967007106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics can be dyed using a single or multiple step process. Union dyeing is used to dye solid colored blends and combination fabrics commonly used for apparel and home furnishings.

==== Cross dyeing ====
Cross dyeing is “a method of dyeing blender or combination fabrics to two or more shades by the use of dyes with different affinities for the different fibers”.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross dyed fabrics may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece dyed fabrics. It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross dyed fabrics and those dyed at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is cross dyeing blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.

Cross dyeing is commonly used with piece or fabric dyed materials. However, the same concept is applicable to yarn and product dyeing. For example, silk fabric embroidered with white yarn can be embroidered prior to dyeing and product dyed when an order is placed.

=== Product dyeing ===
Product dyeing, also known as garment dyeing, is the process of dyeing products such as [[hosiery]], sweaters, and carpet after they have been produced. This stage of dyeing is suitable when all components dye the same shade (including threads). This method is used to dye sheer hosiery since it is knitted using tubular [[knitting machine]]s and then stitched prior to dyeing. Tufted carpets, with the exception of carpets produced using solution dyed fibers, are often dyed after they have been tufted. This method is not suitable for apparel with many components such as lining, zippers, and sewing thread, as each component may dye differently. The exception is tinting jeans with pigments for a “vintage” look. In tinting, color is used, whereas in other treatments such as acid-wash and stone-wash, chemical or mechanical processes are used. After garment construction, these products are given the "faded" or "used" look by finishing methods as opposed to dyeing.

Dyeing at this stage is ideal for quick response. Many T-shirts, sweaters, and other types of casual clothing are product dyed for maximum response to fashion’s demand for certain popular colors. Thousands of garments are constructed from prepared-for-dye (PFD) fabric, and then dyed to colors that sell best.

==Dye types==
Acid dyes are water-soluble [[anionic]] dyes that are applied to fibers such as silk, wool, nylon and modified acrylic fibers using neutral to acid dye baths. Attachment to the fiber is attributed, at least partly, to salt formation between anionic groups in the dyes and cationic groups in the fiber. Acid dyes are not substantive to cellulosic fibers.

Basic dyes are water-soluble cationic dyes that are mainly applied to [[acrylic fibers]], but find some use for wool and silk. Usually acetic acid is added to the dyebath to help the uptake of the dye onto the fiber.

Direct or substantive dyeing is normally carried out in a neutral or slightly alkaline dyebath, at or near boiling point, with the addition of either sodium chloride, sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate. Direct dyes are used on cotton, paper, leather, wool, silk and nylon.

[[Mordant]] dyes require a mordant, which improves the fastness of the dye against water, light and perspiration. The choice of mordant is very important as different mordants can change the final color significantly. Most natural dyes are mordant dyes and there is therefore a large literature base describing dyeing techniques. The most important mordant dyes are the synthetic mordant dyes, or chrome dyes, used for wool; these comprise some 30% of dyes used for wool, and are especially useful for black and navy shades. The mordant, [[potassium dichromate]], is applied as an after-treatment. Many mordants, particularly those in the heavy metal category, can be hazardous to health and extreme care must be taken in using them.

[[Vat dye]]s are essentially insoluble in water and incapable of dyeing fibers directly. However, reduction in alkaline liquor produces the water-soluble alkali metal salt of the dye, which, in this [[Leuco dye|leuco]] form, has an affinity for the textile fiber. Subsequent oxidation reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to [[indigo]], the original vat dye.

[[Reactive dye]]s utilize a [[chromophore]] attached to a substituent that is capable of directly reacting with the fiber substrate. The covalent bonds that attach reactive dye to natural fibers make them among the most permanent of dyes. "Cold" reactive dyes, such as Procion MX, Cibacron F, and Drimarene K, are very easy to use because the dye can be applied at room temperature. Reactive dyes are by far the best choice for dyeing cotton and other cellulose fibers at home or in the art studio.

[[Disperse dye]]s were originally developed for the dyeing of [[cellulose acetate]], and are water-insoluble. The dyes are finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye polyester but they can also be used to dye nylon, cellulose triacetate, and acrylic fibers. In some cases, a dyeing temperature of 130&amp;nbsp;°C is required, and a pressurised dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.

Azoic dyeing is a technique in which an insoluble [[azo dye]] is produced directly onto or within the fiber. This is achieved by treating a fiber with both diazoic and coupling components. With suitable adjustment of dyebath conditions the two components react to produce the required insoluble azo dye. This technique of dyeing is unique, in that the final color is controlled by the choice of the diazoic and coupling components. This method of dyeing cotton is declining in importance due to the toxic nature of the chemicals used.

[[Sulfur dye]]s are two part "developed" dyes used to dye cotton with dark colors. The initial bath imparts a yellow or pale chartreuse color, This is after–treated with a sulfur compound in place to produce the dark black we are familiar with in socks for instance. Sulfur Black 1 is the largest selling dye by volume.

==Printing==
[[Textile printing]] is referred as localized dyeing. It is the application of color in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. Printing designs onto already dyed fabric is also possible. In properly printed fabrics the color is bonded with the fiber, so as to resist washing and friction. Textile printing is related to dyeing but, whereas in dyeing proper the whole fabric is uniformly covered with one color, in printing one or more colors are applied to it in certain parts only, and in sharply defined patterns. In printing, wooden blocks, [[stencil]]s, engraved plates, rollers, or [[silkscreen]]s can be used to place colors on the fabric. Colorants used in printing contain dyes thickened to prevent the color from spreading by capillary attraction beyond the limits of the pattern or design.

==Finishing==
[[Textile finishing]] is the term used for a series of processes to which all bleached, dyed, printed and certain greige fabrics are subjected before they are put on the market. The object of textile finishing is to render textile goods fit for their purpose or end-use and/or improve serviceability of the fabric.

Finishing on fabric is carried out for both aesthetic and functional purposes to improve the quality and look of a fabric. Fabric may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes. Finishing processes include
* Raising
* [[Calendering]]
* Crease resistance
* Filling
* Softening
* Stiffening
* Water repellency
* Moth proofing
* Mildew-proofing
* [[Flame retardant]]
* [[Anti-static]]
* soil resistance

=== Calendering ===
Calendering is an operation carried out on a fabric to improve its aesthetics. The fabric passes through a series of calender rollers by wrapping; the face in contact with a roller alternates from one roller to the next. An ordinary calender consists of a series of hard and soft (resilient) bowls (rollers) placed in a definite order. The soft roller may be compressed with either cotton or wool-paper, linen paper or flax paper. The hard metal bowl is either of chilled iron or cast iron or steel. The calender may consist of 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 rollers. The sequence of the rollers is that no two hard rollers are in contact with each other. Pressure may be applied by compound levers and weights, or hydraulic pressure may be used as an alternative. The pressure and heat applied in calendering depend on the type of the finish required.

The purposes of calendering are to upgrade the fabric hand and to impart a smooth, silky touch to the fabric, to compress the fabric and reduce its thickness, to improve the opacity of the fabric, to reduce the [[air permeability]] of the fabric by changing its porosity, to impart different degree of luster of the fabric, and to reduce the yarn slippage.

=== Raising ===
An important and oldest textile finishing is brushing or raising. Using this process a wide variety of fabrics including blankets, flannelettes and industrial fabrics can be produced. The process of raising consists of lifting from the body of the fabric a layer of fibers which stands out from the surface which is termed as "pile". The formation of pile on a fabric results in a "lofty" handle and may also subdue the weave or pattern and color of the cloth.

There are to types of raising machine; Teasel machine and Card-wire machine. The speed of the card-wire raising machine varies from 12-15 yards per minute, which is 20-30% higher than that of teasel-raising. That is why the card-wire raising machine is widely used.

=== Crease resistance ===
Crease formation in woven or knitted fabric composed of cellulose during washing or folding is the main drawback of cotton fabrics. The molecular chains of the cotton fibers are attached with each other by weak hydrogen bonds. During washing or folding, the [[hydrogen bonds]] break easily and after drying new hydrogen bonds form with the chains in their new position and the creases are stabilized. If crosslinking between the polymer chains can be introduced by [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] chemicals, then it reinforces the cotton fibers and prevents the permanent displacement of the polymer chains when the fibers are stressed. It is therefore much more difficult for creases to form or for the fabric to shrink on washing.

In crease-resist finishing of cotton, the following steps are followed
# Padding the material with a solution containing a condensation polymer precursor and a suitable polymerization catalyst.
# Drying and curing in a stenter frame to form crosslink between the polymer chain and adjacent polymer chain.

The catalyst allows the reaction to be carried out 130-180 degree temperature range usually employed in the textile industry and within the usual curing time(within 3 minutes, maximum).

Three main classes of catalysts are commonly used today.

* [[Ammonium#Ammonium salts|Ammonium salts]], e.g. Ammonium chloride, sulphate and nitrate.
* Metal salts e.g. Magnesium chloride, Zinc nitrate, Zinc chloride.
* Catalyst mixture e.g. [[magnesium chloride]] with added organic and inorganic acids or acid donors.

The purpose of the additives is to offset or counterbalance partly or completely the adverse effect of the crosslinking agent. Thus softening and smoothing agents are applied not only to improve the handle, but also to compensate as much as possible for losses in tear strength and abrasion resistance.
Every resin finish recipe contains surfactants as emulsifiers, wetting agents and stabilizers. these surface-active substances are necessary to ensure that the fabric is wet rapidly and thoroughly during padding and the components are stable in the liquor.
