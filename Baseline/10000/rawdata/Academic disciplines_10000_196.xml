The [[United States Intelligence Community]] '''A-Space''', or '''Analytic Space''', is a project from the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]]'s (ODNI) Office of Analytic Transformation and Technology to develop a common collaborative workspace for all analysts from the [[United States Intelligence Community|USIC]].  It is accessible from common workstations and provides unprecedented access to interagency databases, a capability to search classified and unclassified sources simultaneously, web-based messaging, and collaboration tools.  The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) is the executive agent for building the first phase of A-Space. Initial operational capability was scheduled for December 2007.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A-Space is built on [[Jive Software]]'s [[Clearspace]] application (which has been superseded by Jive's [[Social Business Software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of National Intelligence has identified A-Space as a critical piece of "Analytic Transformation": {{quotation |Analytic Transformation seeks to change how we approach analysis, how we interact with our customers and each other, and is one of the principal priorities of the Director of National Intelligence. US Intelligence is engaged in a fundamental transformation of the Analysis mission at the national level. }}

Within the analytic transformation program, there are several initiatives under way in three areas: 
:1) enhancing the quality of analytic products,
:2) managing the mission more effectively at a  Community level, and
:3) building more integrated analytic operations across the Intelligence Community (IC).&lt;ref name=ATC2007-09-04&gt;{{citation

For contrast, see perceived limitations of CIA information technology at [[Intelligence analysis management#Information technology|CIA Information Technology]].

==Assumptions about improving collaboration among analysts==
A-Space, according to [[Andrew McAfee]] of [[Harvard Business School]],&lt;ref name=McAfee2007&gt;{{citation

 |archivedate=9 January 2008 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a means of sharing information that, in the normal course of events, might not be seen at all. He pointed out that "companies that rely heavily on innovation" spend considerable effort improving the communications among close colleagues.  [[Mark Granovetter]]'s insight, "The Strength of Weak Ties" (SWT) was that strong ties are not enough for the best innovative environments.&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973&gt;{{citation

 | doi=10.1086/225469
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong ties between people arise from long-term, frequent, and sustained interactions; weak ties from infrequent and more casual ones. A tool such as [[Intellipedia]] or A-Space encourages [[collaboration]] among people with weak ties, complementing the traditional "team-building" and "cross-functional management" characteristic of strong ties.

"How do you transform analysis?" asked [[Thomas Fingar]], Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis at the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI). "One word: attitude. For people to collaborate and bring new and vital skills to the intelligence community, we need to change our attitude."&lt;ref name=FCW2007-09-10&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingar said "60 percent of all U.S. intelligence analysts have five years' experience or less on the job. They expect to collaborate no matter where they are and without concern for chain of command," he said. "There is a sense of urgency, a push from the bottom that didn't exist before." Fingar said intelligence failures proved the need to transform intelligence analysis.

"Analysts have become risk-averse and because of that, many times that attitude precludes good analysis," Fingar said. "We have had more than one major problem every decade since Pearl Harbor. We fail because we are not willing to collaborate or accept the risks of collaboration."

==Security==
The first requisite for such a system is that it be secure. To minimize the complexity of the first release, the initial operating capability (IOC) is Web based rather than a full desktop client.  ''Information Week'' stated that A-Space must have 16 different security waivers and move across 16 differently configured firewalls. However, all this information in the browser, even on the secure intelligence Intranet, is bound to raise hackles, presumably for the 16 [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] agencies, according to Mike Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analytic transformation and technology.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;
 
Even though the system will be available only to users with [[security clearance]] for TOP SECRET [[sensitive Compartmented Information|Sensitive compartmented intelligence]] (SCI), security, in the world of intelligence, is not a simple matter of clearance. Individual users will be authorized, or not authorized to access specific "compartments".  For example, while an analyst might be authorized access to the [[HUMINT]] Control System, a major category of SCI, that does not necessarily allow an analyst working on Russia to see data on spies in [[Somalia]]. Somalian and Russian information, sometimes down to the granularity of individual spy contributions, are in separate compartments.

''Information Week'' pointed out that at these security levels, the users themselves need to be monitored.  One of the ways A-Space will maintain its security will be through observing traffic patterns, the department doing things like looking out for suspiciously anomalous searches. "Let's not be [[Pollyanna]]-ish about this," Wertheimer said. "This is a [[counter-intelligence]] nightmare. You've got to ask yourself, if there's one bad apple here, how much can that bad apple learn?"&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

In many cases, an analyst will have to request access to a new compartment or specific piece of information. It is hoped that this process will be speeded by the web-based services.

==Content==
To ensure its usefulness, the project will launch with access to the three large databases of current intelligence and [[Intellipedia]]. Eventually, A-Space will be capable of carrying documents several levels above Top Secret, certified at a level that 95% of all intelligence can be stored there. Reports will be able to be tagged with important related words or phrases via a system called [[TagConnect]] and labeled by usefulness. It will eventually be able to recommend related documents to analysts, much like Amazon recommends related books.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;
{{anchor|Library of National Intelligence|LNI}}

===The Library of National Intelligence===
The Library of National Intelligence (LNI) is an ODNI project to create a repository of all Intelligence Community disseminated intelligence, regardless of classification. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is the executive agent for this project. The Library's electronic card catalog – containing summary information for each report – will be classified at the lowest possible level, permitting analysts to discover everything that has been published by the Intelligence Community (IC) regardless of the original classification of the document. Analysts will be able to request the products in accordance with individual access levels and security guidelines. Services provided by LNI will include the ability to request information directly from producers, qualitative measures of value, and statistics on Community coverage of priorities.&lt;ref name=ATC2007-09-04 /&gt;

===CIA WIRe===
One of the components is [[CIA WIRe]], which went into operation on 7 September 2007. It takes all the agency's intelligence information and makes it available to CIA analysts in one database. According to [[Gus Hunt]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} CIA executive agent for LNI, the full LNI became available on 31 October 2007.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It boggles my mind that it took so long to understand the concept of bringing together all the community knowledge to use effectively," Hunt said. "DNI will let users on the top-secret network share information that was agreed to be released. We now will know [all that] we know about any topic."&lt;br&gt;

[[Dale Meyerrose]], ODNI's chief information officer, said LNI will make all information discoverable [i.e., through weak links&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;], and that is just the starting point. "The pedigree we need to add to data and discovery is huge. It is larger than LNI. The finished product must include intelligence information and open-source information."&lt;ref name=FCW2007-09-10 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social networking===
In a compartmented environment, analysts may be unaware they have a counterpart, in another IC agency, working on a related problem, and they could assist one another. This is equally true of intelligence consumers; a policymaker might be aware of a [[CIA]] report of interest, but not one from the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]]. Indeed, both analysts and consumers may be unaware of the common interests.&lt;blockquote&gt;Social networking will be another critical part of A-Space, where analysts can create trusted contacts with other analysts and post profiles that contain updated contact information and details of their areas of expertise. The analysts' areas of expertise may be further defined through text mining software that sifts through analyst e-mail. The social networking model isn't yet set, but the DNI has invited social networking experts the likes of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and vendors to recommend and help develop specs.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, social networking supports interaction through weak links.&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;

==Contributors==
A-Space is open to all elements of the Intelligence Community. One of the first DIA components to enter A-space will be a new [[Counter-intelligence#Counterintelligence force protection source operations|Force Protection Assessment]] system to provide knowledge management and real-time updates on operational security analyses.&lt;ref name=FCW2007-11-26&gt;{{citation

===Tactical user needs===
The need is not only seen at top executive levels.&lt;ref name=SWJ2007-11&gt;{{citation

 | title = Intelligence Collection and Sharing (Updated)
 | journal = Small Wars Journal
 | first1 = Tim | last1 =Hsia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Hsia, a [[United States Army]] [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]], "Market trackers absorb information continuously, rigorously track trends, and enable traders to formulate decisions based on the latest news combined with historical data. The ability of market trackers to store and quickly recall historical data should be mimicked by the U.S. government ..." Hsia mentioned that the needs for intelligence, by operational military units, are not being met in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware. A fusion of geography and intelligence within a centralized network can ensure that commanders arrive at any location with the necessary intelligence derived from years of work by previous agencies and military units that have already provided a framework for understanding the enemy and the people in his assigned area. Commanders could then be spared the countless man hours recollecting data that has already been captured thru blood, sweat, and tears [captured by weakly linked researchers&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;]"

He describes the field need for a database:&lt;blockquote&gt;A geointel i.e., [[geographic intelligence]] database should include all agencies of the U.S. government and also extend to coalition partners. ...only cleared individuals and organizations can access certain intelligence products. The end state would be to encompass each city in the world from South America, Asia, and the Middle East. Each city in the geointel database would {{sic|comprise| of}} an abundance of historical data consisting of analysis, logistical, intelligence products, and operational summaries from all branches of the military, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), CIA, and [[National Security Agency]]. Moreover, the geointel database would incorporate cutting open source intelligence ([[OSINT]]) products produced by news agencies, [[RAND Corporation|RAND]], and other think tanks. By combining products from different branches within the government it would ensure that policy makers from different agencies would have a complete portrait of their region and thus prevent decisions based on data {{sic|comprised}} solely from their agency...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This fusion of intelligence would not have to be centrally managed and each commander or diplomat could individually assign and weigh different parameters and factors internally within his staff when deciding amongst several courses of action. Intelligence could be pushed down to the lowest level which would then facilitate bottom-up refinement as each new unit that was involved in a certain locale could update the existing data to include their latest experiences. The battlefield commander, diplomat, or [[United States Army Special Forces]] SF ODA (Operational Detachment-Alpha) team leader could then make informed military, foreign affairs, or political decisions that produce more effective results because the data retrieved from the geointel site would provide them with the latest ground truth supplemented with historic data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... The structure of the site should provide ease of accessibility while also compartmentalizing information so that only certain areas can be accessed by individuals depending upon their level of clearance. There would need to be a thorough security vetting process to prohibit individuals from being able to achieve sensitive information outside of their region, scope, and responsibility.... An additional safeguard would be to have superiors and agencies to proof and screen all intelligence products posted by their subordinates so that faulty and inaccurate reporting could be stunted before other organizations implemented inaccurate information...readers could...view the analyst's oeuvre, credentials, and security levels and also allow the reader to directly contact the author as to their assumptions and inquire about related issues pertaining to an intelligence product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hsia points out that while [[SIPRNET]] (i.e., operating at the SECRET security level, not the higher intelligence levels) is widely available, "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware", but software changes in the devices now used to access SIPRNET. Depending on the operational needs, it might be necessary to have additional access points. Typically, only the intelligence staff of a command has access to intelligence data above the SECRET level, just as only the operational staff have access to TOP SECRET mission planning.

==Cost==
[[Michael Wertheimer]] emphasized working with small prototypes at first, which are likely to demonstrate failures. If the prototype is small enough that a new version, which addresses the failure, is not expensive, incremental improvement would be the way to control costs. He mentioned that the initial costs, "well under $5 million", will be for servers, software licenses and design. The greatest design challenge will be achieving the needed security. DNI policy is to have A-Space rely, as much as possible, on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

A [[Service oriented architecture| service oriented architecture (SOA)]] was the basic technical mode for building A-space. Eventually, that will allow analysts and developers to write or install their own widgets (i.e., small customized programs) onto their portal page. Widgets might first access Google Maps content, then attach classified layers to a map that could potentially overlay anti-aircraft missile sites with known bunkers. The intelligence community is already blogging, and A-Space could therefore take advantage of RSS feeds for blog content, among other things.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

It will be implemented as a portal that includes a Web-based word processing tool akin to GoogleDocs, a wiki-based intelligence community encyclopedia and access to three "huge, terabyte databases" of "raw" (i.e., not yet evaluated) data for analysts to examine. It will be scaled for 10,000 users at day one.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3636">'''Anal eroticism''' is erotic activity focusing on the [[anus]], and sometimes the [[rectum]].  
[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that the [[anal stage]] of childhood [[psychosexual development]] was marked by the predominance of anal eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexological==
Since the mid-twentieth century, English speaking sex manuals like ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' have acknowledged the erogenous sensitivity of the anus, and its role in love play.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, [[Alex Comfort]], recognised that [[anal intercourse]] was part of many heterosexual as well as homosexual relationships&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; (as indeed had Freud at the start of the century).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 64-5&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort also stressed the importance (in the French tradition) of [[postillionage]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)#Anal fingering|anal fingering]] prior to orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Some decades after Comfort, [[Margot Anand]] explored how liberating anal eroticism might contribute to [[peak experience]] in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Margot Anand, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 1-2 and p. 336-345&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental==
[[D. W. Winnicott]] would speak accordingly of "the tremendous pleasure that belongs to the doing of a motion just exactly when the impulse comes...another little orgy that enriches the life of the infant".&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud in his 1908 article ''Character and Anal Erotism'' argued that, through reaction formations and sublimation, anal eroticism could turn in later life into character traits such as obstinacy, orderliness and meanness.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 208-15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sándor Ferenczi]] extended his findings to cover the sublimation of anal eroticism into aesthetic experiences such as painting and sculpture, as well as into an interest in money.&lt;ref&gt;Sandor Ferenczi, 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money' in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 264-272&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] linked anal eroticism to feelings of [[disgust]], to [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], and to [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 139, 351 and 359-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Kristeva]] would subsequently explore anal eroticism in connection with her concept of [[abjection]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Restuccia, ''Melancholics in Love'' (2000) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6498">The medieval state of '''[[Kievan Rus']]''' incorporated parts of what is now modern [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Belarus]], and was centered on [[Kiev]] and [[Novgorod]]. Its '''architectural style''' quickly established itself after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988 and was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. After the disintegration of [[Kievan Rus']] followed by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]] in the first half of the 13th century, the architectural tradition continued in the principalities of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Galicia-Volhynia]] and eventually had direct influence on the [[Russian architecture|Russian]], [[Ukrainian architecture|Ukrainian]], and [[Belarusian architecture|Belarusian]] Architecture.

==Church architecture==
[[File:Maket Sofii.JPG|thumb|300px|Before its reconstruction in the 18th century, St. Sofia in Kiev was a prime example and a model for all churches in Kievan Rus]]

The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state which quickly established itself was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like.

The 10th-century [[Church of the Tithes]] in Kiev was the first cult building to be made of stone. The earliest Kievan churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters.

Another great example of an early church of Kievan Rus' was the thirteen-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037–54), built by [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. Much of its exterior has been altered with time, extending ove the area and eventually acquiring 25 domes.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1045-1050), {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on the other hand, expressed a new style that exerted a strong influence on Russian church architecture. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe.

Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117–19), and St George's (1119).

Along with cathedrals, of note was the architecture of monasteries of these times.

The 12th-13th centuries were the period of feudal division of Kievan Rus into princedoms which were in nearly permanent feud, with multipication of cathedrals in emerging princedoms and courts of local princes ''[[knyaz]]es''.

[[File:Bogolyubovo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most famous Russian medieval churches.]]
By the end of the 12th century the divide of the country was final and new centers of power took the Kievan style and adopted it to their traditions. In the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] the local churches were built of white stone with help of Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Suzdal style is also known as "white-stone architecture" ("белокаменное зодчество"). The first white-stone church was the [[St. Boris and Gleb Church]] commissioned by [[Yuri Dolgoruky]], a church-fortress in [[Kideksha]] near Suzdal, at the supposed place of the stay of knyazes Boris and Gleb on their pilgrimage to Kiev. The white-stone churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Rus' architecture. The most important churches in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and [[St Demetrios Cathedral]] (built 1194-97).

In the western splinter of [[Kingdom of Halych-Volhynia]] churches in a traditional Kievan style were built for some time, but eventually the style began to drift towards Central European Romanesque tradition.

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus', particularly the [[Svirskaya Church]] of [[Smolensk]] (1191–94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church (1196–99) in [[Chernigov]] (modern Chernihiv, Ukraine), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

==Secular architecture==
There were very few examples of secular (non-religious) architecture in [[Kievan Rus]]. [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongolian period.

In Kiev, the capital of the country, no secular monuments survived aside from pieces of walls and ruins of gates. The [[Golden Gates of Kiev]] were destroyed completely over the years with only the ruins remaining. In the 20th century a museum was erected above the ruins, it is mirror image of the gates of the Kievan Rus period but is not a monument of the time.

One of the best examples, the fortress of [[Belgorod Kievskiy]], is still lying under the ground waiting major excavation.

In the 1940s, the archaeologist [[Nikolai Voronin]] discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]], dating from 1158-65.

'''Arno Nadel''' (October 5, 1878 – March 1943) was a Jewish [[musicologist]], [[composer]], [[playwright]], [[poet]], and [[painter]].

== Early life ==
Nadel was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], (at the time of his birth, part of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]) to an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family.

== Career ==
In 1890, Nadel moved from Lithuania to Germany. At the age of 12, Nadel studied in [[Königsberg]], [[Germany]], under the cantor [[:de:Eduard Birnbaum|Eduard Birnbaum]]. He also studied with conductor and composer Robert Schwalm.&lt;ref name=UnivHamburg-Bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schipperge|first1=Thomas|title=Arno Nadel|url=http://www.lexm.uni-hamburg.de/object/lexm_lexmperson_00002835|website=[[Universität Hamburg]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, when he was 17 years old,&lt;ref name=PaloAltoReview-TaoistPoetry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasserman|first1=Martin|title=Arlo Nadel and His Taoist Poetry|url=http://www.accd.edu/pac/english/pareview/arlo.htm|website=Palo Alto Review|publisher=[[Palo Alto College]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010911000615/http://www.accd.edu/pac/english/pareview/arlo.htm|archivedate=11 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Berlin and enrolled in the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. He studied with composer Ludwig Mendelssohn and Max Lowengard.&lt;ref name=UnivHamburg-Bio /&gt;

After graduating he worked at the Kottbusser Ufer Synagogue ([[:de:Synagoge Fraenkelufer|Synagoge am Kottbusser Ufer]]) as an educator and choirmaster. In 1916, he became choir director of the Jewish community of Berlin which included the supervision of music at all Berlin synagogues.&lt;ref name=German-JewishMusic-Nadel-2013&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Frühauf|editor1-first=Tina|title=German-Jewish Organ Music: An Anthology of Works from the 1820s to the 1960s|date=2013|publisher=A-R Editions, Inc.|location=Middleton, Wisconsin|ISBN=978-0-895-79761-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh7X_rjAinoC&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;ots=DOQ0iPIula&amp;dq=Robert%20Schwalm%20jewish&amp;pg=PR18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 July 2015|pages=xviii-xix|OCLC=830812812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadel was also a very prolific playwright and poet. Starting in 1918, Nadel took up painting as well, painting several self-portraits and biblical scenes.

In 1922, at the request of Jewish leadership, Nadel worked for years on an anthology of synagogue music, ''Kompendium Hallelujah! Gesänge für den jüdischen Gottesdienst'', which he finished in 1938 and intended to publish in seven volumes.&lt;ref name=LBI-EricMandellCollection&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Mandell Collection, 1963-1964, AR 4408|url=http://access.cjh.org/1361613|website=[[Leo Baeck Institute]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InternetArchive-Digitized-EricMandell&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Mandell Collection|url=https://www.archive.org/stream/ericmandellf001#page/n7/mode/1up|website=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HebUnivJerusalem-Nadel-Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Arno Nadel|website=Jewish Music Research Centre|publisher=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]|url=http://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/arno-nadel|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he was deported, Nadel was able to leave his large collection of old Jewish [[liturgical]] materials with a non-Jewish neighbor,&lt;ref name=PassportJewishMusic-1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskes|first1=Irene|title=Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|ISBN=978-0-313-38911-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFpOGhL3qV8C&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;ots=6NPKNdpM3n&amp;dq=eric%20mandell%20collection&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=nadel&amp;f=false|pages=7–8|accessdate=27 July 2015|OCLC=615600454}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which survived and were purchased by his friend Eric Mandell. What remains of these materials is held at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=WorldORT-Nadel-Bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frühauf|first1=Tina|title=Arno Nadel|website=Music and the Holocaust|publisher=[[World ORT]]|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/places/camps/central-europe/buchenwald/arno-nadel/|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Nadel was married to Beate Anna Nadel.&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookBeate-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadel, Beate Anna – Memorial Book: Victims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Tyranny in Germany 1933–1945|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/en1122984|website=[[Bundesarchiv]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YadVashem-Testimony-1998&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowey|first1=Ester|title=Page of Testimony: Arno Nadel|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/nameDetails.html?itemId=1411637&amp;language=en|website=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=5 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a resident of [[Schöneberg]] quarter of Berlin. In November 1938, he was sent to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadel, Arno – Memorial Book: Victims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Tyranny in Germany 1933–1945|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/en1123081|website=[[Bundesarchiv]]|accessdate=27 July 2015|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nadel was lucky enough to get papers to leave for England, he was too frail to make the trip. In March 1943, he and his wife were deported to the [[Auschwitz]] [[extermination camp]].&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015 /&gt; He died there the same year.&lt;ref name=WorldORT-Nadel-Bio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bundesarchiv-MemorialBookArno-2015 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1486">'''Autocommunication''' is a term used in [[communication studies]], [[semiotics]] and other [[cultural studies]] to describe communication from and to oneself. This is distinguished from the more traditionally studied form of communication where the sender and the receiver of the message are separate. This can be called ''heterocommunication''.

Where heterocommunication gives the receiver new information, autocommunication does not. Instead it enhances and restructures the receiver's ego. Both forms of communication can be found either in individuals or within organisations. When autocommunication is done by an individual it can be called [[intrapersonal communication]].

Autocommunication is typical for religious or artistic works. [[Prayer]]s, [[mantra]]s and [[personal journal|diaries]] are good examples. In organisations and corporations strategic plans and memos, for example, can function like mantras. But any text (or work) can become autocommunicational if it is read many times over.

[[File:Stained glass windows in Lincoln Cathedral 07 East Window.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.5|One of the most prestigious stained glass commissions of the 19th century, the re-glazing of the 13th-century east window of Lincoln Cathedral, Ward and Hughes, 1855.]]

A revival of the art and craft of [[stained-glass]] [[window]] manufacture took place in [[Early modern Britain|early 19th-century Britain]], beginning with an armorial window created by [[Thomas Willement]] in 1811–12.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The revival led to stained glass windows becoming such a common and popular form of coloured pictorial representation that many thousands of people, most of whom would never [[Commission (art)|commission]] or purchase a painting, contributed to the commission and purchase of stained-glass windows for their parish church.

Within 50 years of the beginnings of commercial manufacture in the 1830s, British stained glass grew into an enormous and specialised industry, with important centres in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Birmingham]], [[Whitechapel]] in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Norwich]] and [[Dublin]]. The industry also flourished in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. By 1900 British windows had been installed in [[Copenhagen]], [[Venice]], [[Athens]], [[Bangalore]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Manila]] and [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. St Alban's Copenhagen; Basilica of Ss Giovanni and Paolo, Venice; St Paul's Church, Athens; All Saints' Church, Bangalore; the original Nagasaki Cathedral; Manila Cathedral; St John's Presbyterian Church, Wellington.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War I|Great War]] from 1914 to 1918, stained glass design was to change radically.

==Background==
{{Main|Medieval stained glass}}
[[File:Lincoln Cathedral Bishops Eye.jpg|thumb|The ''Bishop's Eye'', (1320) at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], is filled with salvaged fragments.]]
Following the [[Norman conquest]] of [[England]] in 1066, many churches, abbeys and cathedrals were built, initially in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] or [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style, then in the increasingly elaborate and decorative [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In these churches the windows were generally either large or in multiples so that the light within the building was maximised. The windows were glazed, frequently with [[came glasswork|coloured glass held in place by strips of lead]]. Because flat glass could only be manufactured in small pieces, the method of glazing lent itself to patterning. The pictorial representation of biblical characters and narratives was a feature of Christian churches, often taking the form of murals. By the 12th century stained glass was well adapted to serve this purpose.  For 500 years the art flourished and adapted to changing architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of English glass was smashed by [[Puritans]] under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Churches which retain a substantial amount of early glass are rare. Very few of England's large windows are intact. Those that contain a large amount of Medieval glass are usually reconstructed from salvaged fragments. The east, west and south transept windows of [[York Minster]] and the west and [[transept|north Transept]] windows of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] give an idea of the splendours that have been mostly lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scotland, which never manufactured its own stained glass but bought from the south, they lost much of their glass not because it was smashed but because the monasteries were disbanded. These monasteries had monks with skills in repairing. When they went, windows gradually fell apart.

==Influences on the revival of stained glass==
[[File:York York minster windows 020.JPG|thumb|left|The 14th-century glass of west window of [[York Minster]] has figures set beneath brightly coloured canopies, adopted by 19th-century designers such as [[Clayton and Bell]]]]

===Historic===
Medieval windows and drawings of them provided the source and inspiration for nearly all the earlier 19th-century designers.

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] retains more ancient glass than any other English cathedral except York. Much of it is appears to be imported from France and some is very early, dating from the 11th century. Much of the glass is in the style of [[Chartres Cathedral]] with deep blue featuring as the background colour in most windows. There are wide borders of stylised floral motifs and small pictorial panels of round, square or diaper shape. Other windows contain rows of apostles, saints and prophets. These windows, including the large west window have a predominance of red, pink, brown and green in the colours, with smaller areas of blue. Most of the glass in this remarkable window is older than the 15th-century stone tracery that contains it, the figure of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] being part of a series of [[Jesse Tree|Ancestors of Christ]] that are among the oldest surviving panels in England.
[[File:Canterbury Cathedral 032 Miraculous draft.JPG|thumb|13th-century glass at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is full of lively narratives set in roundels surrounded by foliate scrolls, adopted by many 19th-century designers including [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck|Clutterbuck]], [[William Wailes]] and [[Ward and Hughes]]]]
[[York Minster]] also contains much of its original glass including important narrative windows of the Norman period, the famous "Five Sister" windows, the 14th-century west window and 15th-century east window. The "Five Sisters", although repaired countless times so that they now contain a spider's web of lead, still reveal their delicate pattern of simple geometric shapes enhanced by [[grisaille]] painting. They were the style of window which was most easily imitated by early 19th-century plumber-glaziers. The east and west windows of York are outstanding examples because in each case they are huge, intact, at their original location and by a known craftsman. The west window, designed in about 1340 by Master Robert, contains tiers of saints and stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary, each surmounted by a delicate Gothic canopy in white and yellow-stain, against a red background. The highly ornate tracery lights are filled with floral motifs. White glass ''stone borders'' surround each panel, making it appear to float in its frame. The east window of 1405 was glazed by [[John Thornton (glass painter)|John Thornton]] and is the largest intact medieval window in the world. It presents a narrative in sequential panels of the ''[[Genesis creation myth|Creation]]'', the ''[[Fall of Man]]'', ''the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]]'', ''the [[Apocalypse]]'', ''the [[Last Judgment]]'' and ''the Glory of God''.
York also has windows with small diaper-shaped ''quarries'' painted with little birds and other motifs which were much reproduced in the 19th century.

Between them, the windows of York and Canterbury cathedrals provided the examples for different styles of windows- geometric patterns, floral motifs and borders, narratives set in small panels, rows of figures, major thematic schemes.

Scattered all over England, sometimes in remote churches, is similar evidence of the designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, [[St Neot, Cornwall|St Neot's]] in Cornwall and [[Fairford]] in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. The theme is that of the east window of York, ''[[Salvation|the Salvation of Mankind]]'', but in this case the theme is spread across all the windows of the church, large and small. The west window, of seven lights, shows a single narrative incident, the ''[[Last Judgment]]''. This scheme and these particular windows provided a rare source for the designers of narrative windows for parish churches.&lt;ref&gt;Painton Cowen, Sarah Brown; Lee, Seddon and Stephens {{full|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newstead Abbey from Morris's Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1880).JPG|thumb|left|[[Newstead Abbey]] as it was in the late 19th century]]

===Philosophic===

====Romanticism====
In the 18th century there was a growing trend for philosophers, writers and painters to [[Romanticism|commune with nature]]. Nature was seen as all the more attractive if it contained signs of the grand aspirations, ideals and follies of humankind. Few things were considered more romantic than a medieval ruin which conjured up images of the traditional "romances" or idealistic sagas of the [[Middle Ages]].
England contained a great number of large Medieval ruins. These were chiefly castles destroyed by the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in the 17th century and, even more significantly, vast abbey churches ruined at the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century. These ruined abbey churches suffered three long-term fates. Some were used as quarries for their building materials. The more remote abbeys were simply left to slowly decay.  Those that were conveniently placed were awarded, with their associated lands, to favourites of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and his heirs. Thus it was that many of England's nobility grew up in homes that included within their structure part the Gothic remains of an ancient church or its associated monastic buildings. Some of these houses, such as the poet [[Lord Byron|Byron's]] home, [[Newstead Abbey]], contain reference to their origin within their name.

In the 18th century the owning of such a pile became fashionable. Those of noble lineage who did not have a ruin or a battlemented tower or an interior with pointed arcades promptly built one. Among the earliest of these creations was the novelist [[Horace Walpole|Horace Walpole's]] refurbishing of his London villa, which gave its name to the pretty and somewhat superficial style of architectural decoration known as [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill Gothick]]. The movement gained impetus- Sir [[Walter Scott]] built himself a Scottish Baronial mansion, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]]; the castles of [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]], [[Arundel Castle|Arundel]] and [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] were refurbished by their owners. The movement was just as strong in Germany where "Mad" King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] indulged his medievalism by building the [[Disneyland]] icon of [[Neuschwanstein]]. All over Europe, those who could afford to do so began the restoration and refurbishment of Medieval buildings. The last great Romantic flourish was the building of [[Castle Drogo]] by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] between 1910 and 1930.
[[File:Cambridge University, St. John's Chapel tonal balance.jpg|thumb|St John's College Chapel, Cambridge, by [[George Gilbert Scott]], photograph 1870]]

====The Oxford Movement====
Begun in [[Oxford]] in 1833 by the theologian [[John Keble]] and supported by John Henry Newman, the [[Oxford Movement]] stressed the universality or "catholic" nature of the Christian Church and urged priests of the [[Church of England]] to reconsider their [[English Reformation|pre-Reformation]] traditions in both [[Doctrine]] and [[Liturgy]]. While reinforcing the concept of direct descent from the Apostles through the Church of Rome, the movement did not advocate a return to Roman Catholicism. In practice, however, several hundred Anglican priests, including Newman, became Roman Catholic. The long-term effects of the Oxford Movement were the rapid expansion of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Catholic liturgical styles in many Anglican churches. The emphasis on liturgical rites brought about an artistic revolution in church building and decoration.

====The Cambridge Camden Society====
Formed in 1839 as a society of [[Cambridge]] undergraduates with an interest in Medieval architecture, [[Cambridge Camden Society|this group]] developed into a powerful movement for the recording, study preservation of England's ancient churches, the analysis and definition of architectural style and the dissemination of such information through its publications, chiefly a monthly journal ''The Ecclesiologist'' (1841–1869).
The [[Cambridge Camden Society]] did much to bring about a revival of medieval styles in the design and appointments of 19th-century churches, as well as in the [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of older ones. Their notions were often highly prescriptive, inflexible and intolerant of diversity within the church. They were insistent upon revival rather than originality.

[[File:John Ruskin self portrait 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Self-portrait of [[John Ruskin]], advocate of the Gothic Revival.]]

====John Ruskin====
[[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), an art critic, wrote two books that were highly influential in Art Philosophy. In ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (1849) and ''The Stones of Venice'' (1851–1853), he discussed the moral, social and religious implications of buildings, emphasising the desirability of an ethical approach to the practice of the arts. His thinking influenced the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], whose artistic style Ruskin defended against criticism.

====The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 1849–1853====
This group of artists, of whom [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[William Holman Hunt]] were the central figures, rejected the indulgent [[classicism]], the [[materialism]] and the lack of [[social responsibility]] that they perceived in the artistic trends of mid-19th-century painting. They sought to recreate in their works the simple forms, bright colours, religious devotion and artistic anonymity of the period of art that preceded the rise of the great and famous individuals of the [[Renaissance]] period. They initially exhibited their works signed only with the initials PRB, [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].

[[File:George Frederic Watts portrait of William Morris 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], designer, craftsman and teacher, portrait by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1870]]

====The Arts and Crafts Movement====
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) was for a time a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and was influenced by their ideals and those of John Ruskin. As a precociously diverse designer, he saw the creation of arts in terms of social responsibility. He rejected, as Ruskin did, the mass-production of ornate and decorative wares of all sorts, such as those products of industry that were displayed in the 1851 [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]]. Morris advocated a return to cottage crafts and the revival and promulgation of old skills. To this end he formed a business partnership with Marshall and Faulkner, employing [[Ford Madox Brown]], another highly creative and dynamic artist and thus began what is termed "[[Arts and Crafts Movement|the Arts and Crafts Movement]]".
Stained glass was just one of many products of their studio. Morris and Brown saw themselves as original artists working in the spirit of their antecedents. They did not reproduce earlier forms exactly, and because of disagreements with the philosophy of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], rarely created stained glass windows for ancient churches.
William Morris's success as an entrepreneur was such that he was able to keep Rossetti, Burne-Jones and others in regular employment as designers. Through their teaching at the [[Working Men's College]] in London the group had enormous influence on many designers of all sorts.

====The Aesthetic Movement====
The [[Aesthetic Movement]] was a reaction against both the works of industry and the influential Socialist and Christian idealism of Morris and Ruskin who both saw art as directly linked to morality. Followers of the Aesthetic Movement, who included Burne-Jones and other stained glass designers such as Henry Holiday, propounded a philosophy of "Art for Art's sake". The style that evolved was sensuous and luxurious, linked with the rise of [[Art Nouveau]].

[[File:AWNPugin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]], architect and designer.]]

===Architectural===

====Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin====
[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812–1852) was the son of the Neo-Gothic architect [[Augustus Charles Pugin]] and was a convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1835. He built his first church in 1837. He was an enormously productive and meticulous church architect and designer of interiors.  With the growth of Roman Catholicism in England, and the development of large industrial centres there was much scope for his talents. He worked with and employed other designers and was instrumental in encouraging the firm of [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham to turn their attention to the production of glass.
Pugin's most renowned designs are the interiors, particularly the [[House of Lords]], that he designed for the architect [[Sir Charles Barry]], (1795–1860) at the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. After the destruction by fire of the Houses of Parliament in 1834, Barry had won the commission for their rebuilding, the stipulation being that they should be in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], as the most significant part of the Medieval complex, the Great Hall of [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]], remained standing. The rebuilding, which took up the rest of Barry's life, included a vast array of arts and crafts of all kinds, not the least of which was stained glass windows, both pictorial and armorial.  The knowledge, elegance and sophistication of Pugin's designs imbue and unite the interiors. As an ecclesiastical designer, his influence upon every medium is hard to overstate.

[[File:George Gilbert Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[George Gilbert Scott|George G. Scott]], architect and restorer of cathedrals.]]

====Sir George Gilbert Scott====
As an architect [[George Gilbert Scott|Scott]], (1811–1878), was persuaded by Pugin to turn his creativity towards Gothic Revival.  Scott was an Anglican, his first significant commission being the design of the [[Martyrs' Memorial]] in [[Oxford]], a powerful and highly visible architectural statement against the [[Oxford Movement]]. To Sir Gilbert fell the task of [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of many of England's finest Medieval structures including [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]], [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] and [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] Cathedrals. In the restorations, he was to employ and influence a great number of designers, including major stained glass firms.

====John Loughborough Pearson====
[[John Loughborough Pearson|Pearson]] (1817–1897) was, like Scott, chiefly a restorer of churches.  His major work was the creation of the new cathedral at [[Truro Cathedral|Truro]] in [[Cornwall]].

====Greek Thomson====
[[Alexander Thomson]], nicknamed "Greek", (1817–1875), was one of the best known Scottish architects of his day and had a profound effect on later architects, particularly [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. His building designs are curious and eclectic combinations of elements from the [[Greek architecture|Classical]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], the [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and the [[Exoticism|Exotic]]. He designed a number of churches with richly decorated interiors and employed several stained glass firms to furnish them with glass in the appropriate style.

[[File:Thinke and Thanke Willement.jpg|thumb|left|Armorial window with Willement's motto, from his home, Davington Priory]]

===Manufacturing===

====Industrial Revolution====

With the [[Industrial Revolution|growth of industry]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular the growth of those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, [[metallurgy]] and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. [[Thomas Willement]], a plumber and glazier, produced his first armourial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th-century stained glass industry. Because of the prevalence of [[leadlight]] windows, many glaziers had the required skills for making windows in geometric patterns using coloured glass for chapels and churches.  Between 1820 and 1840 some 40 different glass painters appear in the London trades directories.
At the time of the showcase of [[Victorian age|Victorian]] enterprise, the [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]] of 1851, stained glass manufacture had reached a point where 25 firms were able to display their works, including [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman]] of [[Birmingham]], [[William Wailes]] of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Ballantine and Allen]] of [[Edinburgh]], [[Betton and Evans]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[William Holland (stained glass maker)|William Holland]] of [[Warwick]].

====Charles Winston====
Charles Winston was a 19th-century lawyer whose hobby was the study of Medieval glass. In 1847 he published an influential book on its styles and production, including a translation from Theophilus' ''On Diverse Arts'', the foremost Medieval treatise on painting, stained glass and metalwork, written in the early 12th century.

Winston's interest in the technicalities of coloured glass production led him to take shards of medieval glass to [[James Powell and Sons]] of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance was because it was too flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended a return to the manufacture of hand-made [[Architectural glass|crown]] and [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinder glass]] with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows.

==Stylistic developments in 19th-century stained-glass windows==
&lt;!---NOTE ON SIZING OF PICS if you remove the forced sizing, the pics won't fit. They are each illustrating the text next to them, so that the reader can see what is being described, so none ought to be removed.---&gt;
The stylistic trends below did not necessarily follow each other consecutively. Rather, they overlapped and co-existed. Some stained glass studios were essentially a one-man show in which a single craftsmen designed and made windows of a particular style. Other firms were managed with considerable entrepreneurial skills, employing a number of designers. Some designers freelanced- their work can be seen in windows by a number of firms. Some firms changed with changing tastes and survived well into the 20th century. John Hardman &amp; Co. is still in business.

[[File:Stained glass Quarries.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Window with hand-painted quarries.]]

===Armorial windows===

These contain precisely painted shields and [[Heraldry|heraldic]] decoration utilising painterly skills that had remained in use during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Thomas Willement]] was an armorial painter of windows.

===Geometric patterns===

These windows are simple and decorative, frequently utilising the skills of the provincial [[Plumbing|plumber]]/[[Architectural glass|glazier]]. Many of these windows are among the earliest use of coloured glass but comparatively few have survived because later [[Victorian era|Victorians]] have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s.

===Quarries===

These windows are usually patterned with [[fleur de lys]] and other floral motifs that were suited to the shape of the ''diamond panes''. They added a pleasant glowing ambience to an interior and in many churches in the early 19th century made up the entire glazing. They could be painted or stencilled with designs and are sometimes mould-cast or have impressed motifs. They were systematically replaced one by one when more elaborate windows were donated. These windows generally date from 1830 to 1860. [[James Powell and Sons|Powell]] was a major supplier of impressed and stencilled quarries.

[[File:Stained glass Foliage.JPG|thumb|95px|left|Medieval foliage and Classical Figures.]]

===Medieval foliate windows===

From studying [[Stained glass|Medieval windows]], particularly those at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], many stained glass artists became adept at designing foliage and decorative borders that reproduce [[Archaeology|archaeological]] originals. There are windows of this type in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing [[The Bible|scriptural]] texts.

In those windows that are set with figurative ''rondels'', the style within them is often [[Classicism|Classical]] (see below) but sometimes [[Gothic art|Medievalising]] and sometimes seeks to reproduce the original style so accurately that to they casual eye they have the appearance of ancient windows. Ancient windows in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] were removed in the 19th century and replaced with copies. There is a very fine [[Jesse Tree]] (the Ancestors of Christ) window of this nature at the eastern end. Two panels of the original have since been returned.

===Classical figures===

Although often striving for an [[Exoticism|exotic]] appearance, the figures in many early 19th-century windows are [[Classicism|classicising]] in style. Set against a background of ''geometry'', ''quarries'' or ''foliage'', the small painted incidents within ''rondels'' and ''quatrefoils'' are nearly always conservatively [[Academic art|academic]] in their appearance, with figures based on those in [[Steel engraving|engravings]] of works by admired painters, [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Perugino]]. Often in the case of windows with ornate foliage, the archaeologically correct surrounds are at variance with the style of the rondels which make no attempt to reproduce the medieval. [[William Wailes]] and [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck]] were among the important firms.

[[File:Stained glass Gothic Revival.JPG|thumb|right|95px|Gothic forms and pure colour.]]

===Gothic Revival===

Inspired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]] and the [[Gothic Revival]], some artists sought to reproduce the style of figures that they saw in ancient glass, [[illuminated manuscripts]] and the few remaining English wall paintings of the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] period. A major source was provided by the [[Biblia Pauperum]]  or so-called "Poor Man's Bible". The resulting figures are elongated, curvilinear and stylised rather than naturalistic. The drapery folds and scrolls are exaggerated and the gestures are expansive. The painted details are highly linear, crisply defined and elegant. The style lent itself to narrative, to pure colour and to highly decorative effects. While the figures may seem quaint or even naïve, the quality of design of many of these windows is often highly sophisticated and the detailing exquisite.  The masters of Gothic revival were [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham and [[Clayton and Bell]].

[[File:Stained glass Arts &amp; crafts.JPG|thumb|95px|left|asymmetric design with bold colours]]

===Arts and Crafts Movement===

The group that surrounded and were influenced by [[William Morris]] passed through a series of trends, initially [[Pre-Raphaelites|Pre-Raphaelite]], which, although espousing the Medieval, was not [[Gothic Revival]] in the archaeological sense, being an esoteric mix of [[Medieval art|Medieval]], [[Early Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] and deeply personal influences. The [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style lent itself to the depiction of solidly working-class [[apostles]] and [[virtues]] set against backgrounds of quarries that resemble glazed earthenware tiles. The botanically accurate and semi-realistic grapevines, sunflowers and other growing things were more prominent than Gothic canopies.  Narratives that emphasised hard labour, human decency and charitable love were the themes that lent themselves to enthusiastic treatment by Morris and [[Ford Madox Brown]]. [[Burne-Jones]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] were to become philosophic traitors to the Arts and Crafts Movement by their association with the [[Aesthetic Movement]].

[[File:Stained glass Naturalism.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Human interest and tertiary colours.]]

===Naturalism===

The 1870s was a time of rich ornamentation and [[eclecticism]] in the arts. The treatment of Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to an appearance of having been carved from fine white [[limestone]]. [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] architectural details made an appearance and were often used without reference to the nature of the real [[architecture]] that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after [[World War I]].

The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style of figure painting began to give way to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such [[steel engraving|engravings]]. The works of [[Albrecht Dürer]] were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of [[Mayer of Munich]] which influenced English designers towards this style.

In the late 19th century there is often a great richness in the colouration of the windows, marked by a use of tertiary colours including rich purple, salmon pink, olive green, claret red, saffron and brown. ''Flashed glass'' was skillfully employed to enhance deep folds in robes. With this interest in colour, many windows depict atmospheric effects. Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures.

In line with the naturalistic drafting of the figures, there is a pictorial emphasis on depicting human interaction and response, often with detailed facial expressions and rather flamboyant gestures. Large scenes with large figures were popular. Among the major exponents were [[Lavers, Barraud and Westlake]]; and [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]].  These trends continued, taking two basic directions until [[World War I]].

The notable exceptions to the general trend were a large number of the windows made by Clayton and Bell who produced a diverse range of styles and continued to supply cheerfully coloured Gothic-style windows with a proliferation of bright red and yellow to catch the morning sun in church chancels.

[[File:Stained glass Refinement.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Elegant figures in subdued colours.]]

===Refinement===

A somewhat more reserved style emerged in which the vibrant colouration is toned down in favour of backgrounds that are basically white, discreetly enhanced with ''yellow-stain''. The clothing of the figures is often of the darker shades, royal blue, wine red and dark green and is lined or bordered with intricately decorated yellow-stained glass. The painting of canopies and draperies was taken to a new height. The [[grisaille|monochrome]] painting of faces is intensely detailed. The style lent itself to the depiction of [[saint]]s and [[prophet]]s, [[bishop]]s and [[admiral]]s, and [[Christ]] (or [[Queen Victoria]]) enthroned. The most influential firm in this style was [[Burlison and Grylls]]. There are many windows by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] of this type.

[[File:Stained glass Aesthetic.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Individual. Much use of opalescent glass.]]
'''Aestheticism'''

The [[Aesthetic Movement]] included [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Burne-Jones]], the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. They propounded "Art for Art's sake", claiming that Beauty was an end in itself and that the creation of art should not be bound to any social or moral ideals. The Aesthetic artists were primarily concerned with the creation of that which was beautiful. Because of this, windows created by these artists are often stylistically diverse from each other and from other styles, yet are highly recognisable as the work of a particular designer, rather than of a particular workshop.

These windows rarely pay homage to [[Medieval art|Medieval]] origins. They are closely associated with [[Art Nouveau]]. The designs are often sinuous, luscious and richly textured, making highly creative use of ''flashed glass'' and repetitive forms. Drifting clouds, sweeping draperies and angel's wings lent themselves to the art of the Aesthetes. The idiosyncrasies of Burne-Jones’ style make his windows particularly easy to recognise.  While [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] made many windows that were traditional and "safe", he designed others that are clearly aesthetic. [[Christopher Whall]] and, in America, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] were Aesthetic designers.

[[File:Stained glass Opulent.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Luxurious drapery, pearl borders.]]

===Opulence===

In the last days of the [[British Empire|Empire]], the technical proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of ground-glass paint and yellow-stain:- babies’ ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the [[Edwardian period]] are the most opulent creations of the stained glass industry. The youthful [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] of the [[Annunciation]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] the fisherman, [[John the Baptist|John]] the itinerant preacher and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls.

In the years immediately following [[World War I]], many of these windows were created by the more conservative studios as memorials to fallen soldiers. Hence there are countless two-light windows of [[St George]] and [[St Michael]] and even more lancets of the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]] gathering his lost sheep to the fold. These are the last product of the second [[Golden Age]] of stained glass window production.&lt;ref&gt;The example illustrated commemorates a 21-year-old soldier who died in the Great War. His brothers, who also died aged 17 and 19, are commemorated in the adjacent window of Christ with the Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common types of 19th-century windows based on content==
(For ''Glossary of terms''', see below. The terms in italics are explained.)

* Small rectangular or ''diaper quarries'' of clear glass set with an ''armorial'' shield, the colours being painted and fired onto the glass.
* Simple geometric decorative patterns in repeating shapes based on large, often overlapping, circles, squares and ''diapers'' set against a background of clear or decorated quarries, often within a plain brightly coloured border, surrounded by an additional clear border.
* Densely patterned diaper-shaped ''quarries'' with the design either hand painted in ''grisaille'' and ''yellow-stain'' or moulded and printed into the glass. See No.1 below
* ''Quarry'' windows set with one or more ''roundels'', ''quatrefoils'' or ''mandorlas'' containing a symbol, figure or biblical scene.
* Elaborate, intensely coloured foliage-based patterns, usually set with figurative roundels or quatrefoils and imitating ''Norman'' and ''Early Gothic'' windows. See No.2 below
* Rows of apostles, saints, prophets or virtues, each occupying one ''light'' and usually set in an architectural frame surmounted by an ornate ''canopy''. In the case of a large window with an irregular number of lights, the figure of Jesus or the Virgin with the Christ Child is usually at the centre. See No.3 below
* A series of related narrative scenes, each depicted in a single ''light'' within architectural surrounds. See No.4 below
* A series of small related narratives depicted in rows across several ''lights'', like a comic strip. See No.5 below
* A single significant incident or theme occupying a window of several ''lights'' so that the pictorial content spans the divisions in the window. See Nos.6&amp;7 below
* A complex arrangement in a large window where a central incident spread across several lights is surrounded by related themes in the outer lights, lower panels and ''tracery''. See No.8 for two related themes within a small window.

==Glossary of terms used above==

* '''Lancet''' – a single simply shaped window that is tall and narrow, and with a pointed arch at the top so that its shape is similar to a knife blade.
* '''Mullion''' – a vertical stone architectural member which divides and supports sections of a large window.
* '''Tracery''' – the pattern of stonework found at the tops of many windows.
* '''Light''' – one discreet section of a window of any shape, but most usually applied to the tall vertical sections when the window is divided up by stone mullions.
* '''Tracery lights''' – the irregularly shaped sections of glass that fill the tracery at the tops of windows.
* '''Panel''' – a part of a window that is constructed as a single piece. Most church windows with the exception of small lancets contain several panels.
* '''Diaper''' – a diamond or lozenge-shaped piece of glass. Many old windows, both ecclesiastical and domestic, are made from glass in a diaper pattern. Many figurative windows have a background of diapers.
* '''Quarry''' – a four-sided geometrically shaped piece of glass, coloured, painted, printed or impressed with a design and used to create a regular decorative pattern in a window.
* '''Grisaille''' – monochrome painting on glass using a mixture of ground glass, ground lead and other substances.
* '''Yellow-stain''' – a pigment of silver nitrate painted and fired on the surface of a window to give a bright yellow colour.
* '''Stone-border''' – a thin border of glass, generally white or transparent but sometimes red, encircling a window light and giving a radiant effect.
* '''Roundels, quatrefoils and mandorlas''' – these are shapes to be found within window designs, containing a picture or significant motif. A ''roundel'' is circular, a ''quatrefoil'' has four lobes like a simple flower, a ''mandorla'' is the shape enclosed by two arcs, meeting at points top and bottom and usually only used to contain a depiction of [[Christ]] or a symbol of him. It is sometimes also used for a depiction of the [[Virgin Mary]].
* '''Canopy''' – a motif found in many windows representing an elaborate architectural canopy, usually [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style but occasionally [[Classicism|Classical]]. The canopy and accompanying columns give the visual impression that the figure or scene is set in a carved niche or viewed through an elaborate window.
* '''Flashed glass''' – is glass which is made by dipping the blowing rod, or "pontil", into one colour then a second, and sometimes a third, before blowing to a sheet. The resulting sheet has a thin layer of a darker colour "flashed" over a paler colour. The dark colour can be removed, or partially removed, by abrading or etching.

[[File:701 East Lake Drive, Cape May Point, NJ.jpg|thumb|Northwood Center in Cape May Point of the Cape May Bird Observatory]]
The '''Cape May Bird Observatory''' was founded in 1975 in [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]] and is sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society.  The purpose of the Cape May Bird Observatory is to conduct research, encourage conservation, and organize educational and recreational birding activities.  It consists of two separate centers: the Center for Research and Education in Cape May Court House in the central part of Cape May County, and the Northwood Center in Cape May Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape May Bird Observatory: Our Centers|url=http://www.njaudubon.org/sectioncapemaybirdobservatory/aboutcmbo/ourcenters.aspx|publisher=[[New Jersey Audubon Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bird migration==
Cape May is at a crossroads for bird migration. Every spring and fall, thousands of migrating birds pass through the area. Subsequently, birders from all over the world have flocked to Cape May to witness the migrations. 

==Ecotourism==
Former Cape May Bird Observatory Director Paul Kerlinger published landmark studies on [[ecotourism]] in the 1990s, showing the impact of ecotourism dollars on Cape May and several other tourist areas with wildlife refuges. The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] honored his work with a special citation by then director Molly Beattie. 

The Cape May Bird Observatory, as part of the [[New Jersey Audubon Society]], also helps to organize the [[World Series of Birding]] each May. The World Series, as well as other birding festivals, such as the Cape May Fall Weekend, bring hundreds of people to the Cape May area, who enjoy its rich avifauna and support the local economy. 

==Authors==
The Cape May area is home to many birding authors, including Dunne, Kerlinger, Pat and Clay Sutton, Michael O'Brien, Richard Crossley and Kevin Karlson.

Author [[David Allen Sibley]] was also a Cape May birder. Sibley wrote his classic field guide, ''[[The Sibley Guide to Birds]]'', while he was living and birding in Cape May Point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

There are many definitions of co-production. One technical definition is that '''Co-production''' is where technical experts and other groups co-generate new knowledge and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Christenson. ''The Co-production of Archaeological Knowledge: The 	Essential Relationship of Amateurs and Professionals in 20th Century American Archaeology. Complutum (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) 24(2): 63-72, 2013 https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/view/43367&lt;/ref&gt; It is the dynamic interaction between [[technology and society]]. It has a long history, particularly arising out of radical theories of knowledge in the 1970s.

==Description==
Co-production forms part of [[Mode 2]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow ''The New Production of Knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies'' Sage. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. ''States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order''.  Routledge.  2004. {{ISBN|978-0-415-40329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbers, Hans. ''Inside the Politics of Technology: Agency and Normativity in the Co-Production of Technology and Society''.  Amsterdam University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used in the [[sociology of science]] to describe one of the modes, or ways that knowledge is formed. In [[Mode 2]], science and technology studies the move from extreme [[technological determinism]] and [[social constructivism]], to a more systemic understanding of how technology and society ‘co-produce’ each other. Co-production is functionally comparable to the concepts of [[causality loop]], [[positive feedback]], and [[co-evolution]] – all of which describe how two or more variables of a system affect and essentially create each other, albeit with respect to different variables operating at different scales. And as with these other concepts, if used too broadly/uncritically, co-production risks [[noetic flatness]] – if technology and society co-produce each other equally, the justification for maintaining the boundary between them dissolves (in which case [[actor-network theory]] may be invoked). Unless overlapping sets of [[boundary-work]] are employed, co-production may also fail to account for power differentials within each variable, (in this case, within technology and society).

==Science, technology and society==
From a more [[Science, technology and society|STS]] perspective, [[Sheila Jasanoff]], has written that "Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in." Co-production draws on constitutive (such as [[Actor–network theory]]) and interactional work ([[Leviathan and the Air-Pump|such as the Edinburgh School]]) in [[Science, technology and society|STS]].  As a sensitizing concept, the idiom of co-production looks at four themes: "the emergence and stabilization of new techno-scientific objects and framings, the resolution of scientific and technical controversies; the processes by which the products of techno-science are made intelligible and portable across boundaries; and the adjustment of science’s cultural practices in response to the contexts in which science is done."  Studies employing co-production often follow the following pathways: "making identities, making institutions, making discourses, and making representations"&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order. Routledge. 2004 http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Development Effectiveness Indicator''' (DEI) is a consolidated measure, used primarily by [[Development_finance_institution|Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)]], of the development effectiveness achieved by an institution. This measure relates directly to the development results achieved through a particular development intervention or financed activity. The DEI is a composite aggregation of a range of performance measures that may incorporate interventions across various sectors within the development arena. The formulation of a development effectiveness indicator was motivated primarily by the limitations of current development effectiveness reviews and the need to provide a dynamic adaptive mechanism to track effectiveness and provide operational and strategic insight. The indicator was produced by Jason Bygate and Karl Meyer in 2016 in South Africa for emerging markets.

An '''emblem book''' is a [[book]] collecting [[emblem]]s (allegorical illustrations) with accompanying explanatory text, typically morals or poems. This category of books was popular in Europe during the [[16th century in literature|16th]] and [[17th century in literature|17th centuries]].

Emblem books are collections of sets of three elements: an icon or image, a motto, and text explaining the connection between the image and motto.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text ranged in length from a few lines of verse to pages of prose.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; Emblem books descended from medieval bestiaries that explained the importance of animals, proverbs, and fables.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  In fact, writers often drew inspiration from Greek and Roman sources such as [[Aesop's Fables]] and [[Plutarch's Lives]]. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Definition ==
{{quote|But if someone asks me what Emblemata really are? I will reply to him, that they are mute images, and nevertheless speaking: insignificant matters, and none the less of importance: ridiculous things, and nonetheless not without wisdom [...]|Jacob Cats, ''Voor-reden over de Proteus, of Minne-beelden, verandert in sinne-beelden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al de werken van I. Cats|location= Amsterdamfirst= Jan Jacobsz. |last=Schipper|year= 1665|url=http://www.brill.com/sites/default/files/ftp/downloads/31773_Titlelist.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars differ on the key question of whether the actual [[emblem]]s in question are the visual images, the accompanying texts, or the combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This is understandable, given that first emblem book, the ''[[Emblemata]]'' of [[Andrea Alciato]], was first issued in an unauthorized edition in which the [[woodcut]]s were chosen by the printer without any input from the author, who had circulated the texts in unillustrated manuscript form. It contained around a hundred short verses in Latin.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; One image it depicted was the lute which symbolized the need for harmony instead of warfare in the city-states of Italy. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

Some early emblem books were unillustrated, particularly those issued by the French printer Denis de Harsy.&lt;!-- As of 3/2015, there is not even a French article on him.--&gt; With time, however, the reading public came to expect emblem books to contain picture-text combinations. Each combination consisted of a [[woodcut]] or [[engraving]] accompanied by one or more short texts, intended to inspire their readers to reflect on a general [[morality|moral]] lesson derived from the reading of both picture and text together. The picture was subject to numerous interpretations: only by reading the text could a reader be certain which meaning was intended by the author. Thus the books are closely related to the personal symbolic picture-text combinations called [[personal device]]s, known in Italy as ''{{Lang|it|imprese}}'' and in France as ''{{Lang|fr|devises}}''.  Many of the symbolic images present in emblem books were used in other contexts, on clothes, furniture, street signs, and the facades of buildings. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  For instance, a sword and scales symbolized death.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Miscellany == &lt;!-- I'm not happy about the name of this headline, but I couldn't find a better name, and we need one to mark the end of the "Definition" section. --&gt;
Emblem books, both [[secular]] and [[religious]], attained enormous popularity throughout continental Europe, though in Britain they did not capture the imagination of readers to quite the same extent. The books were especially numerous in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France.

Many emblematic works borrowed plates or texts (or both) from earlier exemplars, as was the case with [[Geoffrey Whitney]]'s ''Choice of Emblemes'', a compilation which chiefly used the resources of the [[Plantin Press]] in Leyden.

Early European studies of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], like that of [[Athanasius Kircher]], assumed that the hieroglyphs were emblems, and imaginatively interpreted them accordingly.

A similar collection of emblems, but not in book form, is [[Lady Drury's Closet]].

The '''European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology (EUSFLAT)''' is a scientific association with the aims to disseminate and promote [[fuzzy logic]] and related subjects (sometimes comprised under the collective terms [[soft computing]] or [[computational intelligence]]) and to provide a platform for exchange between scientists and engineers working in these fields. The society is both open for academic and industrial members.

==History==

EUSFLAT was founded in 1998 in Spain as the successor of the National Spanish Fuzzy Logic Society, [[ESTYLF]], with the aim to open the society for members from other European countries. Since then, the society managed to attract a large share of members from outside Spain, and even beyond Europe, with the Spanish members still being the largest group inside EUSFLAT. For these historical reasons, the society is officially registered in Spain.

==Conferences==

Starting with 1999, EUSFLAT has been organizing its biannual conferences in odd years. Previous meetings:

*[[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]], September 22–25, 1999 (jointly with National Spanish conference, [[ESTYLF]])
*[[Leicester]], [[United Kingdom]], September 5–7, 2001
*[[Zittau]], [[Germany]], September 10–12, 2003
*[[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], September 7–9, 2005 (jointly with 11th [[Rencontres Francophones sur la Logique Floue et ses Applications]])
*[[Ostrava]], [[Czech Republic]], September 11–14, 2007
*[[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], July 20–24, 2009 (jointly with 13th World Congress of the [[International Fuzzy Systems Association]])
*[[Aix-les-Bains]], [[France]], July 18–22, 2011 (jointly with Les Rencontres Francophones sur la Logique Floue et ses Applications)
*[[Milan]], [[Italy]], September 11–13, 2013
*[[Gijón]], [[Spain]], June, 30–3 July 2015

==Publications==

* EUSFLAT publishes the proceedings of its conferences in an open access manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusflat.org/publications/proceedings.htm EUSFLAT Conference Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Until 2010, [[Mathware &amp; Soft Computing]] was the official journal of EUSFLAT. On July 1, 2010, the [[International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems]] (Atlantis Press, {{ISSN|1875-6891}} (print) / {{ISSN|1875-6883}} (on-line)) became the official journal of EUSFLAT.
* EUSFLAT publishes an electronic newsletter with three issues a year.

==Presidents==
EUSFLAT is led by the President, who is elected for a two-year period, and cannot serve for more than two consecutive periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusflat.org/society/bylaws.htm EUSFLAT bylaws]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Francesc Esteva]] (1998–2011)
* [[Luis Magdalena]]  (2001–2005)
* [[Ulrich Bodenhofer]] (2005–2009)
* [[Javier Montero]] (2009–2013)
* [[Gabriella Pasi]] (2013–present)

The '''Graphene Research Centre''' (GRC), at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), is the first centre in Asia dedicated to [[graphene]] research.&lt;ref name=annual_report/&gt; The Centre was established under the scientific advice of two [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureates in physics]] – Prof [[Andre Geim]] and Prof [[Konstantin Novoselov]] - who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of graphene.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; It was created for the conception, characterization, theoretical modeling, and development of transformative technologies based on two-dimensional crystals, such as graphene.&lt;ref name=grapheneNUS/&gt;

== History and funding ==

'''''He Who Gets Slapped''''' is a [[1924 in film|1924]] American [[silent film|silent]] [[tragedy]] and [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Lon Chaney]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; November 12, 1924, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; November 8, 1924, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by [[Victor Sjöström]]. The film is based on the Russian play ''Тот, кто получает пощёчины'' ("He Who Gets Slapped", transliterated as ''Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny'') by playwright [[Leonid Andreyev]], which was published in 1914 and in English, as ''He Who Gets Slapped'', in 1922.&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/he-who-gets-slapped-12746 ''He Who Gets Slapped''] at the Internet Broadway Database, retrieved Oct. 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.

''He Who Gets Slapped'' was the first film produced entirely by the newly formed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was not, however, MGM's first released movie, as the film was held until the Christmas season when higher attendance was expected. The movie was highly profitable for the fledgling MGM, and was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] as the mascot for MGM. Previously, Leo appeared in the logo for [[Goldwyn Pictures Corporation]] in 1916, and the trademark was retained by MGM when the companies merged.

The film was important in the careers of Chaney, Shearer, Gilbert, and Sjöström. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paul Beaumont ([[Lon Chaney]]) is a scientist who labored for years alone to prove his radical theories on the origin of mankind.  Baron Regnard ([[Marc McDermott]]) becomes his patron, enabling him to do research while living in his mansion. One day, Beaumont announces to his beloved wife Marie and the Baron that he has proved all his theories and is ready to present them before the Academy of the Sciences. He leaves the arrangements to the Baron. However, after Beaumont goes to sleep, Marie steals his key, opens the safe containing his papers, and gives them to the baron.

On the appointed day, Paul travels to the Academy with the Baron. He is aghast when the Baron, instead of introducing him, takes credit for Paul's work himself. After he recovers from the shock, Paul confronts him in front of everyone, but the Baron tells them that Paul is merely his assistant and slaps him. All of the academicians laugh at his humiliation. Paul later seeks comfort from his wife, but she brazenly admits she and the baron are having an affair and calls him a clown. Paul leaves them.

Five years pass by. Paul is now a clown calling himself "HE who gets slapped", the star attraction of a small circus near [[Paris]]. His act consists of his getting slapped every evening by other clowns, and includes Paul pretending to present in front of the Academy of Science.

Another of the performers is Bezano ([[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]), a daredevil horseback rider. Consuelo ([[Norma Shearer]]), the daughter of the impoverished Count Mancini, applies to join his act. Bezano falls in love with Consuelo, as does Paul. Consuelo and her father, however, are planning to restore the family's fortunes with a marriage to her father's wealthy friend.

One night, during HE's performance, he spots the baron in the audience. The baron goes backstage and begins flirting with Consuelo, which she does not like. The next day, the baron sends Consuelo jewelry, but she rejects it.

When her father leaves for a meeting with the baron, Bezano takes Consuelo out to the countryside for a romantic meeting, where they declare their love for each other. Meanwhile, Count Mancini convinces the reluctant baron that the only way he can have Consuelo is by marrying her. The baron discards the heartbroken Marie, leaving her with a check.

Later, HE admits to Consuelo he, too, is in love with her. She thinks he is kidding and laughingly slaps him. They are interrupted by the baron and the count, who inform Consuelo she will marry the baron after the night's performance. When HE tries to interfere, he is locked in an adjoining room, where an angry lion is kept in a cage. He moves the cage so that, when he carefully opens it, only the door to the next room prevents the lion from escaping. HE re-enters the other room through the only other entrance (making sure to lock it behind him) and reveals his identity to the baron. HE threatens the baron, but the count stabs him with a sword.

The baron and the count try to leave but, finding the main entrance locked, open the side door, releasing the lion. The animal kills the count, then the baron. However, the lion tamer shows up and saves HE from the same fate. HE goes on stage and collapses. He assures Consuelo he is happy and that she will be happy, before dying in her arms.

'''''How Green Was My Valley''''' is a 1939 novel by [[Richard Llewellyn]], narrated by Huw Morgan, the main character, about his Welsh family and the [[Mining in Wales|mining]] community in which they live. The author had claimed that he based the book on his own personal experiences but this was found to be untrue after his death; Llewellyn was English-born and spent little time in Wales, though he was of Welsh descent.&lt;ref name="Wales Arts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/richard-llewellyn/index.shtml | title=Richard Llewellyn| publisher=BBC Wales | date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Llewellyn gathered material for the novel from conversations with local mining families in [[Gilfach Goch]].&lt;ref name="Wales Arts"/&gt;

The title of the novel appears in two sentences. It is first used in Chapter Thirty, after the narrator has had his first sexual experience. He sits up to "...&amp;nbsp;look down in the valley." He then reflects: "How green was my Valley that day, too, green and bright in the sun." The phrase is used again in the novel's last sentence: "How green was my Valley then, and the Valley of them that have gone."

In the United States, Llewellyn won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for favourite novel of 1940, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1941&gt;
"Books and Authors", ''The New York Times'', 16 February 1941, page BR12. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel is set in [[South Wales]] during the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It tells the story of the Morgans, a respectable mining family of the [[South Wales Valleys]], through the eyes of one of the sons, Huw Morgan.

Huw's academic ability sets him apart from his elder brothers and enables him to consider a future away from the dangerous coal mines. His five brothers and his father are miners. After his eldest brother, Ivor, is killed in a [[mining accident]], Huw moves in with his sister-in-law, Bronwen, with whom he has always been in love &lt;ref&gt;Due to this character, the female first name "Bronwen" - hitherto known only in Wales - was introduced to the English-speaking public at large (see Sheard, K. M. (2011), {{Google books|FVyHTUQnnBgC|Llewellyn’s Complete Book of Names|page=110}}, {{ISBN|9780738723686}}).&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of Huw's three sisters, Angharad, marries the wealthy mine owner's son – whom she does not love – and the marriage is an unhappy one. She never overcomes her clandestine relationship with the local minister.

Huw's father is later killed in a mine explosion. After everyone Huw has known either dies or moves away, and the town is reduced to a contaminated shell, he decides to leave, and tells the story of his life just before going away.

==Adaptations==
{{main article|How Green Was My Valley (film)}}

The 1941 Hollywood film adaptation, which was highly successful, had a cast that included [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Anna Lee]], [[Roddy McDowall]] (as Huw), [[Donald Crisp]], and [[Barry Fitzgerald]]. None of the leading players was Welsh (though Welsh actor Rhys Williams made his screen debut in the film in a minor role). Directed by John Ford, ''How Green Was My Valley'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. ''How Green Was My Valley'' is available on DVD from [[20th Century Fox]] as part of their 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

The book has twice been adapted by the [[BBC]] for television, in 1960 and 1975. The [[How Green Was My Valley (mini-series)|1975 production]]– scripted by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]]&amp;nbsp;– starred [[Stanley Baker]], [[Siân Phillips]], and [[Nerys Hughes]].

The novel was adapted as a Broadway musical, called ''[[A Time for Singing]]'', which opened at the Broadway Theatre, New York, on 21 May 1966. The music was by John Morris; book and lyrics were by Gerald Freedman and John Morris. The production was directed by Mr. Freedman, and it starred Ivor Emmanuel, Tessie O'Shea, Shani Wallis, and Laurence Naismith.

A stage version, adapted by [[Shaun McKenna]] was performed at the [[Royal Theatre (Northampton)|Theatre Royal]] in [[Northampton]] in 1990.  It marked the stage debut of [[Aled Jones]] as the teenage Huw. It was directed by [[Michael Napier Brown]] and designed by Ray Lett.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shaunmckenna.net/#/how-green-was-my-valley/4559746578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the book was also adapted as a short film for the use in the music video&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/564107696/alt-j-make-a-breathtaking-short-film-for-pleader|title=alt-J Make A Breathtaking Short Film For 'Pleader'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the song Pleader&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2017/11/15/alt-j-pleader-video-epic-share|title=Alt-J essentially make their own period drama for their 'Pleader' video|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the band [[alt-J]]. The music video adaptation takes some liberties in retelling the story, with the catastrophic family deaths being caused by a landslide, which was caused by a German V2 rocket during WWII rather than a mine explosion.

{{nihongo|'''Kyushu University'''|九州大学|Kyūshū Daigaku}}, abbreviated to {{nihongo|''Kyudai''|九大|Kyūdai}}, is a Japanese national university located in [[Fukuoka]], in the island of [[Kyushu]]. It is the 4th oldest university in Japan and one of the former [[Imperial Universities]]. It is considered one of the most prestigious research-oriented universities in Japan. The history of Kyushu University can be traced back to the medical schools of the feudal domains established in 1867.

There are 2,089 foreign students ({{as of |2016}}) enrolled in the University. It was chosen for the Global 30 university program, and has been selected to the top 13 global university project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selection for the FY 2014 Top Global University Project |publisher=MEXT|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/houdou/26/09/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2014/10/07/1352218_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbol ==
Kyushu University does not have an official school song, instead it has one cheering song and three student songs including ''Matssubara-ni'', with lyrics by Yoshifumi Akiyama.

The University's logo features a background of pine needles inset with an older iterance of the kanji for "university". The logo was officially established in 2004, but was originally proposed by a student, Sou Yoshihide, in the mid-20th century, and was used then on from 1950. There have also been alternatives designs, such as those featuring the Japanese ''KU'' or ''Q'', for Kyushu instead of "university".

On March 3, prior to the incorporation of national universities in April 2004, the Committee of Public Relations agreed on a new university logo and color that symbolize Kyushu University under the new structure.

=== University logos ===
The pine needle design, which is used in the current university logo, remains in the new logo. On deciding the new logo, consideration was given as to whether it would still be highly distinctive even when electronically rendered. The introduction of the new logo, however, does not limit or eliminate the use of the previous one Fig. B.

Several patterns of university logos (Figs. C-F) have been created for use on PR materials and merchandise. Fig. C uses the same design as Fig. A without the two Chinese characters that mean “university,” while Fig. D illustrates a design using the capital letters of Kyushu University (KU). Fig. E symbolizes the letter “q” for “Q-shu” University. Fig. F is the logo originally printed on the university diploma. These logos are also registered and used as trademarks of Kyushu University.

=== Logo color ===
Dark red colors have been used for the logo of Kyushu University. The committee chose wine red as the new university logo color given that it is similar to the previous one and does not spoil the established image of Kyushu University’s logo color. Since the visual effects of color can vary according to usage, a variation of the wine color within an allowable range can be used as the logo color. To allow broader variations, the use of sub-colors was also approved.

== Global 30 Project&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/intlweb/data/pdf/gaiyou.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ==
On July 3, 2009, Kyushu University was chosen as one of thirteen venues for the “Global 30 (G30) Project”, planned and funded by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). The major aim of the project is to further promote the globalization of Japanese higher education by assisting a select number of universities through the prioritized allocation of grants. The recipient schools are expected, among other things, to build and improve a system whereby overseas students may study and engage in research with minimal cultural and linguistic barriers. This more focused approach to budget allocation is also expected to help realize the government’s public commitment to accommodate more than 300,000 international students on Japanese campuses by 2020.

In February 2010, the University opened an all-purpose office in Cairo, Egypt, bringing the number of its overseas offices to 13 . Although the Cairo Office is managed by Kyushu University, all other Japanese colleges and universities can have access to its services and facilities when trying to recruit students or promote academic projects in Egypt.

By implementing these measures, Kyushu University is expecting to raise the number of its international students to 3,900 within a decade, a 300% increase over the current number. By the time the five-year grant terminates, the University will also have laid the foundation for a new interdisciplinary department (tentatively called the “International School of Arts and Sciences”), which is expected to launch by 2020.

=== Liberal arts subjects and basic sciences ===
For the first year and a half, students in the international undergraduate programs study various liberal arts subjects and basic sciences. This segment of the programs aims not only to equip students with in-depth liberal arts knowledge and to help them deepen their understanding of various disciplines, but also to broaden their range of interests, and to enable them to continue learning independently.

== International Cooperation&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ==

=== MJIIT (Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology) ===
The governments of Japan and Malaysia have jointly established a university in Malaysia which follows the Japanese style of education in engineering. It opened in September 2011. From the time the concept of this project was initiated, Kyushu University has played a core role and now, as the leading university of mechanical precision engineering subcommittee of a school specializing in precision mechanical engineering, it hopes to take an active role in the promotion of this project.

=== AUN/SEED-NET ===
(ASEAN University Network/ Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network) The AUN/SEED-Net was established in 2003 to full the following; to strengthen the main ASEAN universities education and research abilities, to strengthen the network between the universities of all the countries involved, including Japan, as well as, continuing to produce scientists needed in the economic and social areas of ASEAN nations. By accepting International Students and dispatching teachers, Kyushu University endeavors to train teachers of universities in ASEAN nations.

=== BOP by ICT ===
Income generation project for farmers at the BOP by ICT Kyushu University uses the funding from JICA to support Bangladeshi farming villages by creating business centers where ICT is used to provide farmers with the necessary information for farming. These centers are available anytime the farmer would like to visit. They are information hubs, where useful information regarding farmers produce and sales are being distributed by the use of ICT, amongst farmers in the hope that this will improve their income and reduce poverty.

== Graduate schools and faculties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
Kyushu University has instituted a Graduate School/Graduate Faculty system - the first attempt of this kind at a Japanese university - as part of the overall reorganization of undergraduate and graduate education at the university in 2000. In separating the former Graduate School into the Graduate School (the education body) and the Graduate Faculty (the research body to which faculty members belong), the University is seeking to revitalize relationships between the Graduate Faculty and the Graduate School, and the Graduate Faculty and Undergraduate School. These changes should promote a more dynamic functioning of the Graduate Faculty in its relation to the Graduate School and the Undergraduate School. (Refer to chart  below.)

Under the Graduate School/Faculty system, all faculty members have been transferred from members of the Undergraduate Faculty to members of the Graduate Faculty. In addition, the educational body (Graduate School) and research body (Graduate Faculty) have become independent administrative entities. This new, more responsive administrative mechanism will enable Graduate Faculty members to participate more flexibly in the education of both the Undergraduate and Graduate School bodies. In implementing a more dynamic configuration of the education bodies (Undergraduate and Graduate Schools) and research body (Graduate Faculty), the university can more readily accommodate changes and shifts to pedagogic and research foci that may occur in the future.

=== History ===
Kyushu University is one of the seven former Imperial Universities created in the [[Meiji period]]. The university is the largest research university in the Kyushu region with research centers in eleven different academic faculties, including the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and science.

Kyushu University Hospital is affiliated with the Faculty of Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Dental Science.

'''1867''' The [[Kuroda Clan]] establishes an institution for Western medicine (Sanseikan) for the children of the lord and their retainers. The roots of present-day Kyushu University Hospital can be traced back to the clinic affiliated with that school.

'''1879''' In the beginning of the Meiji period the clinic becomes an affiliated hospital of Fukuoka Prefectural Medical School.

'''1903''' Fukuoka Medical College, a branch school of Kyoto Imperial University is established, and the hospital becomes affiliated with that school.

'''1911''' Kyushu Imperial University is established in Fukuoka, and this hospital becomes affiliated with the university's Faculty of Medicine.

'''1931''' The Research Institute of Balneotherapeutics is established in [[Beppu]], [[Ōita Prefecture]].

'''1947''' Following the university reform that took place after World War II, the hospital’s name was changed to the Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences Affiliated Hospital. Fifteen departments, including a dental department, were established.

'''1967''' The Faculty of Dental Science becomes an independent facility. The Faculty of Dental Science Affiliated Hospital opens.

'''2003''' The three hospitals affiliated with Faculty of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dental Science and Medical Institute of Bioregulation merge to form Kyushu University Hospital.

'''2009''' Plans for the construction of a new hospital, which began in 2000, are completed. The new hospital consists of a South Ward, North Ward, West Ward and Outpatient Ward.

=== JST ERATO Takahara Soft Interfaces Project ===

The 19th century was the era of hard materials such as steel, some of which were replaced by polymers in the 20th century. The 21st century will be the time of “soft materials”, including polymers, colloids, gels, vesicles, emulsions, films, surfactants, micelles, suspensions and liquid crystals. They are essential to produce various electrical &amp; optical devices, and biodevices etc. The soft materials are increasingly indispensable in our daily lives. Since surfaces and interfaces of soft materials“( soft interfaces”) play an important role in various technological applications and bio-interfaces, precise control of soft interfaces would greatly promote the innovation of future science and technology. In this project, we are focusing on the understanding of fundamental science of soft interfaces formed in nature and extract the molecular and structure design principles. The following three groups are organized in order to pursue this project: 1) Precise molecular design of soft interfaces based on precise synthetic chemistry, 2) Hierarchical structural control and fabrication of soft interfaces through understanding natural systems, and 3) Development of in situ and dynamical characterization methods of soft interfaces.

'''The Lancaster Environment Centre''' ('''LEC''') in [[Lancaster, England]], is an interdisciplinary centre for teaching, research and collaboration at [[Lancaster University]], founded in 2003.

==Facilities==
Its facilities were a joint investment eventually costing over £35 million by [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] / [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology|CEH]] and Lancaster University. There are CEH and Lancaster University laboratories, developed partly by a new extension to Lancaster University’s former Biological and Environmental Sciences building and partly by extensive refurbishment of areas of the existing laboratories. Research activities span both organisations. There are extensive research laboratories, fifteen glasshouses and ten walk-in controlled environment rooms. These include high-grade containment facilities for research with genetically modified organisms and radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/about/ | title = Lancaster Environment Centre Website| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/news/lecopen.htm| title = LEC News Article| accessdate = 2007-10-29| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118085642/http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/news/lecopen.htm| archivedate = 18 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gordon Manley]] Building, (LEC III) was opened by [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Rees of Ludlow Kt]]. The £8.4m building provides new office, laboratory and meeting-room space for geographers and environmental scientists, and provides offices, meeting and training rooms for LEC’s Enterprise &amp; Business Partnerships Team and offices for companies wishing to locate into LEC or to co-locate new activities.

In addition to the main site is a 1000m² [[prefabricated building]] at the northern end of [[campus]], which houses environmental engineering and instrumentation workshops and large-scale sample preparation facilities for CEH. There is a weather station and several field stations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/facilities/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The research themes of LEC are organised around several Grand Challenges:&lt;ref name="lancaster.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/research/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Agri-Food - facilitate the development of globally relevant and accessible food systems by 2030.
* Eco-Innovation - sustainable patterns of consumption and production 
* Sustainable Catchments
* Tropical Futures

Specific research groups were reorganized in 2016:&lt;ref name="lancaster.ac.uk"/&gt;
*Atmosphere, Climate and Pollution -  the sources, transformation, trends and fate of chemicals in the environment with a focus on atmospheric composition, air quality and climate.
* Critical Geographies -  critical geographies that are vital to sustainability, social and environmental justice and our collective futures. 
* Earth Science: Volcanology and Hazards, Contemporary Environmental Processes, Sub-surface Fluids, and Palaeoclimatology and Palaeoenvironments.
* Ecology and Conservation -  molecular, behavioural and ecological techniques to understand how ecosystems function, how they respond to global change, and how they can be managed to enhance biodiversity and its associated services.
* Environmental and Biogeochemistry -  inorganic chemistry, stable and radioactive isotopes, noble gases, and trace organic analysis. 
* Geospatial Data Science -  innovative spatial techniques in order to increase our understanding of a wide range of environmental and socio-ecological systems.
* Political Ecology - relationship between culture, politics and nature.
* Soil, Plant and Land Systems - molecular to the crop scale 
* Water Science 
* Pentland Centre - transdisciplinary research on sustainability and business, jointly with the Management School.  
* Centre for Global Ecoinnovation - positive environmental impacts through new products, processes and services for the global marketplace.

The science programmes and themes of CEH are:

*Water
*Biodiversity
*Biogeochemistry
*Environmental Informatics
*Climate Change
*Sustainable Economies

These provide a range of research interests within the Lancaster Environment Centre and are post-disciplinary.  A Graduate School of the Environment was launched in 2016, to provide a focus for Masters and PhD students, in partnership with CEH and [[Rothamsted Research]].

== LEC Centres ==

In addition to this research endeavour, the two organisations developed research centres to provide a specific strategic research focus on particular areas of current concern. These undertake [[blue skies research]] and provide a strategic focus for LEC's collaborative work with science users, including policymakers and industry. Most have now been folded into the research groups noted above.

They included:

===The Centre for Sustainable Chemical Management===
Led by Professor Kevin Jones, the Centre has been established to provide an integrated approach covering all aspects of chemical fate, behaviour and effects. This ranges from development of new chemicals designed for fitness of purpose without resulting in adverse impact on human health or the environment to safe disposal options. This includes providing input to the "design" of new chemicals that are "fit for their purpose" but avoid the physico-chemical properties which lead to undesirable traits in the environment, such as persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/ccm/index.htm| title = Centre for Sustainable Chemical Management| accessdate = 2007-10-29| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129011056/http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/ccm/index.htm| archivedate = 29 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Centre for Environmental Informatics===
Led by Professor Ian Marshall, the Centre is currently targeting the development of self-managing heterogeneous infrastructures for data gathering and analysis at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales for both science and industry. This experimental research is motivated by the need to characterise and model the non-linear interdependencies between dynamic natural processes and enable improved prediction of the impacts of factors such as climate change and changes in land-use.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/cei/ | title = Centre for Environmental Informatics| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre for Global Eco-Innovation===
The Centre for Global Eco-Innovation supports the development of new products and services with environmental benefits. It delivers business led research, through enabling enterprises to access the expertise resources and global contacts of Lancaster University and its national and international partners.

===The Centre for Sustainable Water Management===
Led by co-directors Professor Louise Heathwaite and Professor Phil Haygarth, the Centre seeks to deliver cross-disciplinary science in water-related research areas. Faculty and Research staff in the Centre undertake research to develop scientific tools and techniques to enable the uncertainties associated with land and water use problems to be addressed in the development of sustainable water management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/cswm/ | title = Centre for Sustainable Water Management| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Centre for Sustainable Agriculture===
Led by Professor Felix Wackers, the Centre seeks to couple research in plant science with a practical focus on sustainable agriculture in order to address the ecological, economic and social challenges facing agriculture in a changing global environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/csa/ | title = Centre for Sustainable Agriculture| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enterprise &amp; Business Partnerships ==

The purpose of the business incubation centre within LEC is to allow environmental business to rent office space within the centre, enabling faster business growth through finding easier access to LEC research, knowledge, laboratories, clean rooms, workshops and specialist instruments.&lt;ref name="lec.lancs.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lec.lancs.ac.uk/business/offices/ | title = LEC Office Pages| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative Work===
LEC is interested in a wide range of research partnerships from across the environmental sector, and companies locating within LEC can access these resources for research, new product development, managing environmental impacts, developing environmental CSR programmes, and responding to legislative or consumer pressures. LEC is a partner in the International Research &amp; Innovation Centre for the Environment (I-RICE), a joint initiative with the CAS Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry (GIGCAS). I-RICE is a platform for international and inter-disciplinary research on the 'grand challenges' of the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal formalism''' is both a descriptive theory and a [[Normative|normative theory]] of how judges should decide cases. In its descriptive sense, formalists believe that judges should reach their decisions by applying uncontroversial principles to the [[Trier of fact|facts]]. Although the large number of decided cases implies a large number of principles, formalists believe that there is an underlying logic to these principles that is straightforward and which legal experts can readily discover. The ultimate goal of formalism would be to formalise the underlying principles in a single and determinate system that could be applied mechanically (hence the label 'mechanical jurisprudence'). Formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'. It is the thesis to which [[legal realism]] is the antithesis.

As a normative theory, formalism is the view that judges should decide cases by the application of uncontroversial principles to the facts.

==Definition==
Formalism remains one of the most influential and important theories of adjudication and has been called the thesis to which realism is the antithesis.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, T. C. (1983). Langdell’s Orthodoxy. University of Pittsburgh Law Review, 45, 1. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Formalism sees adjudication as the uncontroversial application of accepted principles to known facts to derive the outcome in the manner of a deductive syllogism.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (2008). How Judges Think. Cambridge, Massachusetts; London: Harvard University Press.
p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalists believe that the relevant [[law|principles of law]] of a given area can be discerned by surveying the [[case law]] of that area.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony T. Kronman. (1993). The Lost Lawyer: Failing Ideals of the Legal Profession. Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, B. (1997). Is There an “American” Jurisprudence? Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 17(2), 367–387. p.373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]] believed that the only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.&lt;ref&gt;Langdell, C. C. (1887). Harvard Law School. Law Quarterly Review, 3, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bix, B. H. (2009). Jurisprudence: Theory and Context (5th edition). Sweet &amp; Maxwell. p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism has been called an 'autonomous discipline',&lt;ref&gt;Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the formalist belief that judges require only the facts and the law, all normative issues such as morality or politics being irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, B. (2010). Legal Formalism and Legal Realism: What Is the Issue? Legal Theory, 16(02), 111–133. http://doi.org/10.1017/S1352325210000121&lt;/ref&gt; If judges are seen to be simply applying the rules in a mechanical and uncontroversial manner, this protects judges from criticism. For this reason, formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, How Judges Think, 2008, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalists, contrary to Realists, take the judge at face-value, assuming that the facts and principles as recorded in a judge's reasons reflect the facts that the judge considered to be relevant, and the principles that the judge arrived at to reach the judgement. They therefore place little emphasis on the means by which a judge determines the facts.

As a normative theory, legal formalists argue that judges and other public officials should be constrained in their interpretation of legal texts, suggesting that investing the judiciary with the power to say what the law ''should'' be, rather than confining them to expositing what the law ''does'' say, violates the [[separation of powers]]. This argument finds its most eloquent expression in the [[Massachusetts Constitution of 1780]], which provides that the [[judiciary]] "shall never exercise the [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] powers, or either of them; to the end [that Massachusetts' government] may be a government of laws, and not of men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhinet.org/ccs/docs/ma-1780.htm] Mass. Const. (1780).&lt;/ref&gt; Formalism seeks to maintain that separation as a "theory that law is a set of rules and principles independent of other political and social institutions".&lt;ref name="definition.blacks"&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] 913 (7th ed. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to legal realism==
Legal formalism can be contrasted to legal instrumentalism, a view associated with American [[legal realism]]. [[Instrumentalism]] is the view that creativity in the interpretation of legal texts is justified in order to assure that the law serves good public policy and social interests, although legal instrumentalists could also see the end of law as the promotion of [[justice]] or the protection of [[human rights]]. Legal formalists counter that giving judges authority to change the law to serve their own ideas regarding policy undermines the rule of law. This tension is especially interesting in [[common law]], which depend on judicial [[precedent]]. The "claim to fame" of common law systems is that the task of developing and updating law is best done incrementally by courts that keep in close touch with social, economic, and technological realities than by political organs that, every so often, will attend to legal reforms. Thus legal realism or "relationalism" has been favored in some common law jurisdictions, where the kind of legal [[Codification (law)|codification]] associated with [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] are virtually unknown.

==Justice Scalia and formalism==
The late [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] was noted for his formalist views about a variety of topics, particularly his view that the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted in accord with its [[originalism|original meaning]] and his view that statutes should be read in accord with their [[Plain meaning rule|plain meaning]].

In ''A Matter of Interpretation'', Scalia defended textualism — and, by extension, formalism — saying:
:Of all the criticisms leveled against textualism, the most mindless is that it is formalist. The answer to that is, ''of course it's formalistic!'' The rule of law is ''about'' form . . . A murderer has been caught with blood on his hands, bending over the body of his victim; a neighbor with a video camera has filmed the crime and the murderer has confessed in writing and on videotape. We nonetheless insist that before the state can punish this miscreant, it must conduct a full-dress criminal trial that results in a verdict of guilty. Is that not formalism? Long live formalism! It is what makes us a government of laws and not of men.&lt;ref name="scalia.amoi"&gt;Antonin Scalia, ''A Matter of Interpretation'' 25 (1997) (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia's strongest claim on Formalist credentials can be found in an essay entitled ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules''.&lt;ref name="scalia.rules"&gt;Antonin Scalia, ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules'', 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederick Schauer==

Frederick Schauer, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in 1988 published a law review article titled "Formalism" in ''The Yale Law Journal''. In it he urges scholars to rethink the "contemporary aversion to formalism" and states that his goal is to "rescue formalism from conceptual banishment".&lt;ref name="frederick.schauer"&gt;Frederick Schauer, ''Formalism'', 97 Yale L.J. 509, 511, 539 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in terms of merely whether it is a good or bad thing, but rather in terms of how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process.

==Woleński==
In his essay "Formal and informal in legal logic", [[Jan Woleński]] contends that there are "rhetorical functions of metalogical concepts that are used in legal discourse", and hence the introduction of the informal into otherwise [[imperative logic]]. He reviews Jørgensen’s paradox to introduce [[deontic logic]], and acknowledges this innovation by [[Georg Henrik von Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Woleński]] (2011) "Formal and Informal in Legal Logic", pages 73 to 86 in ''Approaches to Legal Rationality'', edited by D.M Gabbay, P. Canivez, S. Rahman &amp; A. Thierselin, [[Springer books]] {{ISBN| 978-90-481-9587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42956">An [[architectural style]] is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable.  A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character.  Most [[architecture]] can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different.

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.

==Chronology of styles==
{{Expand list|date=March 2011}}

===Prehistoric===
Early [[civilizations]] developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.

===The Dark Ages===
The European "Dark Ages" are generally taken to run from the end of the [[Roman Empire]], around 400 AD, to around 1000 AD. Relatively little is known of this period, but Christianity (spread by the Romans) was already making a significant impact on European culture, and the Romans left a technological and social legacy.

===Medieval Europe===
The dominance of the Church over everyday life was expressed in grand spiritual designs which emphasized piety and sobriety. The Romanesque style was simple and austere. The Gothic style heightened the effect with heavenly spires, pointed arches and religious carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zyHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA75 Robert Stuart (1854), ''Cyclopedia of architecture: historical, descriptive, typographical, decorative, theoretical and mechanical, alphabetically arranged, familiarly explained, and adapted to the comprehension of workmen'', A.

===The Renaissance and its successors===

1425-1660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Leinwand, ''The pageant of world history'', Prentice-Hall, 1990, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7jzT0qcJu1MC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Jackson J.

===Neoclassicism===
1720-1837 and onward. A time often depicted as a rural idyll by the great painters, but in fact was a hive of early industrial activity, with small kilns and workshops springing up wherever materials could be mined or manufactured. After the Renaissance, neoclassical forms were developed and refined into new styles for public buildings and the gentry.

===Revivalism and Orientalism===
Late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Victorian Era was a time of giant leaps forward in technology and society, such as iron bridges, aqueducts, sewer systems, roads, canals, trains, and factories. As engineers, inventors, and businessmen they reshaped much of the British Empire, including the UK, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and influenced Europe and the United States. Architecturally, they were revivalists who modified old styles to suit new purposes.

===Modernism and other styles contemporary with modernism===
1880 onwards. The Industrial Revolution had brought steel, plate glass, and mass-produced components. These enabled a brave new world of bold structural frames, with clean lines and plain or shiny surfaces. In the early stages, a popular motto was "[[Ornament and Crime|decoration is a crime]]". In the [[Eastern Bloc]] the Communists rejected the [[Western Bloc]]'s 'decadent' ways, and modernism developed in a markedly more bureaucratic, sombre, and monumental fashion.

In reasoning to [[argument|argue]] a claim, a [[fallacy]] is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]] of the argument and permits its recognition as [[soundness|unsound]]. Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.

Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006" /&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies.{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=This needs examples, and/or to be broken into different sentences—this is difficult to follow, and "in turn" to what? The previous sentence? Things within this long sentence?}} Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=fallacy |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |publisher= Encyclopedia Brittanica |website= Brittanica.com |accessdate= 13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty inferences in [[deductive reasoning]] are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of [[inductive reasoning]] is based on [[probability]], a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as "weak".

The conscious or habitual use of fallacies as [[rhetorical device]]s are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hornby |first1=A.S. |title= Oxford advanced learner's dictionary of current English |date=2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [England] |isbn= 978-0194799003 |edition=8th |quote= sophist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal fallacies ==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}
A formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the [[argument form|argument's form]].{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067957_ss1-95 "formal fallacy"]}} All formal fallacies are specific types of [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequiturs]].  
* [[Appeal to probability]] – a statement that takes something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might be the case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leon|first1=Joseph|title=Appeal to Probability|url=http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|website=Logical &amp; Critical Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927130844/http://logical-critical-thinking.com/logical-fallacy/appeal-to-probability/|archivedate=27 September 2013|date=23 April 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Simon|title=Appeal to probability|url=http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|website=Toolkit For Thinking|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219013634/http://www.toolkitforthinking.com/critical-thinking/anatomy-of-an-argument/deductive-logic-arguments/appeal-to-probability-1|archivedate=19 February 2015|date=2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from fallacy]] (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – assumption that if an ''argument'' for some conclusion is fallacious, then the ''conclusion'' is false.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/fallfall.html "Fallacy Fallacy"]}}
* [[Base rate fallacy]] – making a probability judgment based on [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]], without taking into account the effect of [[prior probability|prior probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Base%20Rate%20Fallacy |title=Base Rate Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=Psychology Glossary |publisher=AlleyDog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conjunction fallacy]] – assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/conjunction_fallacy.htm |title=Conjunction Fallacy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |work=ChangingMinds.org |last=Straker |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Masked-man fallacy]] (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/illisubs.html "The Masked Man Fallacy"]}}

=== Propositional fallacies ===
A propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: &lt;and&gt;, &lt;or&gt;, &lt;not&gt;, &lt;only if&gt;, &lt;if and only if&gt;). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.
&lt;br /&gt;Types of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] fallacies:
* [[Affirming a disjunct]] – concluding that one disjunct of a [[logical disjunction]] must be false because the other disjunct is true; ''A or B; A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Affirming the consequent]] – the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the [[consequent]] is true; ''if A, then B; B, therefore A''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}
* [[Denying the antecedent]] – the [[consequent]] in an [[indicative conditional]] is claimed to be false because the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is false; ''if A, then B; not A, therefore not B''.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=316}}

=== Quantification fallacies ===
A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.
&lt;br /&gt; Types of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] fallacies:
* [[Existential fallacy]] – an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}

=== Formal syllogistic fallacies ===
[[Syllogistic fallacy|Syllogistic fallacies]] – logical fallacies that occur in [[syllogisms]].
* [[Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise]] (illicit negative) – a categorical [[syllogism]] has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of exclusive premises]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of four terms]] (''quaternio terminorum'') – a categorical syllogism that has four terms.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|pp=133–36}}
* [[Illicit major]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not [[distribution of terms|distributed]] in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Illicit minor]] – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Negative conclusion from affirmative premises]] (illicit affirmative) – a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=317}}
* [[Fallacy of the undistributed middle]] – the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|pp=316–17}}
* [[Modal fallacy]] – confusing possibility with necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/127/Modal_Scope_Fallacy|title=Modal (Scope) Fallacy|last=Bennett|first=Bo|date=|website=Logically Fallacious|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal fallacies ==
{{Main|Informal fallacy}}
Informal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679510_ss1-120 "informal fallacy"]}}
* [[Argument to moderation]] (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad temperantiam}}'') – assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=150}}
* [[Continuum fallacy]] (fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, sorites fallacy, fallacy of the heap, bald man fallacy) – improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise.{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Line-Drawing "Line-Drawing"]}}
* [[Correlative-based fallacies]]
** [[Suppressed correlative]] – a correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethical Theory: An Anthology |chapter=Psychological Egoism |page=193 |first=Joel |last=Feinberg |editor-first=Russ |editor-last=Shafer-Landau |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |series=Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3320-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By9nCkAvS6EC&amp;pg=PT211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Divine fallacy]] (argument from incredulity) – arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Robert T.|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|work=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|url=http://skepdic.com/dvinefal.html|title=divine fallacy (argument from incredulity)|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double counting (fallacy)|Double counting]] – counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding [[unity (number)|unity]].
* [[Equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time).{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=121}}
** [[Ambiguous middle term]] – a common ambiguity in syllogisms in which the [[middle term]] is equivocated.{{sfn|Copi|Cohen|1990|p=206}}
** Definitional retreat – changing the meaning of a word to deal with an objection raised against the original wording.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirie|first=Madsen|authorlink=Madsen Pirie|title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=10 September 2015|year=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-9006-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Motte-and-bailey fallacy – The arguer conflates two similar positions, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial (the "bailey"). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position.&lt;ref name="mott-and-bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackel|first1=Nicholas|title=The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]|date=2005|volume=36|issue=3|quote=For my purposes the desirable but only lightly defensible territory of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|Motte and Bailey castle]], that is to say, the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or position with similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible. The Motte is the defensible but undesired position to which one retreats when hard pressed...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Accent (fallacy)|Fallacy of accent]] – a specific type of ambiguity that arises when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual prosodic stress, or when, in a written passage, it's left unclear which word the emphasis was supposed to fall on.
** {{crossref|printworthy=y|(See also the [[#If-by-whiskey|if-by-whiskey]] fallacy, below.)}}
* [[Ecological fallacy]] – inferences about the nature of specific individuals are based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which those individuals belong.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=119}}
* [[Etymological fallacy]] – reasoning that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=70}}
* [[Fallacy of composition]] – assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=31}}
* [[Fallacy of division]] – assuming that something true of a thing must also be true of all or some of its parts.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=53}}
* [[False attribution]] – an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.
** [[Fallacy of quoting out of context]] (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) – refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=97}}
* [[False authority]] (single authority) – using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to sell a product or idea.  Related to the [[appeal to authority]] (not always fallacious).
* [[False dilemma]] (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) – two alternative statements are held to be the only possible options when in reality there are more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html |title=Fallacy – False Dilemma |accessdate=2011-02-01 |publisher=The Nizkor Project |work=Nizkor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[False equivalence]] – describing a situation of logical and apparent equivalence, when in fact there is none.
* [[Historian's fallacy]] – the assumption that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=209}} (Not to be confused with [[presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], which is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas, such as moral standards, are projected into the past.)
* [[Historical fallacy]] – a set of considerations is thought to hold good only because a completed process is read into the content of the process which conditions this completed result.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology", John Dewey, ''The Psychological Review'', Vol. III. No. 4. July 1896. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homunculus fallacy]] – a "middle-man" is used for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. Explains without actually explaining the real nature of a function or a process. Instead, it explains the concept in terms of the concept itself, without first defining or explaining the original concept. Explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker, a sort of [[homunculus]] inside the head, merely explains it as another kind of thinking (as different but the same).{{sfn|Bunnin|Yu|2004|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120113200604/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?query=homunculus&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;book_id=g9781405106795_9781405106795&amp;from=search&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;type=std&amp;id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067959_ss1-77&amp;slop=1 "Homunculus"]}}
* {{vanchor|Inflation of conflict}} – arguing that if experts of a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point, the experts must know nothing, and therefore no conclusion can be reached, or that the legitimacy of their entire field is put to question.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments"&gt;{{cite web|title=A List Of Fallacious Arguments|url=http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{vanchor|[[If-by-whiskey]]}} – an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are selectively emotionally sensitive.
* [[Incomplete comparison]] – insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison.
* [[Inconsistent comparison]] – different methods of comparison are used, leaving a false impression of the whole comparison.
* [[Intentional Fallacy|Intentionality fallacy]] – the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so.)&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K. Wimsatt|Wimsatt, William K.]] and [[Monroe Beardsley|Monroe C. Beardsley]]. "The Intentional Fallacy." ''[[Sewanee Review]]'', vol. 54 (1946): 468–88. Revised and republished in [https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22William%20Kurtz%20Wimsatt%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry''],  U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kettle logic]] – using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position.{{dubious|Kettle logic|date=August 2016}}
* [[Ludic fallacy]] – the belief that the outcomes of non-regulated random occurrences can be encapsulated by a statistic; a failure to take into account [[there are known knowns|unknown unknowns]] in determining the probability of events taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nassim |last=Taleb |title=The Black Swan |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |isbn=1-4000-6351-5 |page=309 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMuF4A4XF8C&amp;pg=PA127 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[McNamara fallacy]] (quantitative fallacy) – making a decision based only on quantitative observations, discounting all other considerations.
* [[Mind projection fallacy]] – subjective judgments are "projected" to be inherent properties of an object, rather than being related to personal perceptions of that object.
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]. For instance, inferring ''is'' from ''ought'' is an instance of moralistic fallacy. Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy defined below.
* [[Moving the goalposts]] (raising the bar) – argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded.
* [[Nirvana fallacy]] (perfect-solution fallacy) – solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect.
* ''[[Philosophic burden of proof|Onus probandi]]'' – from the Latin ''onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat'' the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions the claim). It is a particular case of the ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad ignorantiam}}'' fallacy, here the burden is shifted on the person defending against the assertion. Also known as "[[shifting the burden of proof]]".
* [[Proof by assertion]] – a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with [[argument from repetition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad infinitum}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad nauseam}}'')
* [[Prosecutor's fallacy]] – a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of {{em|some}} false match being found.
* [[Proving too much]] – using a form of argument that, if it were valid, could be used to reach an additional, invalid conclusion.
* [[Psychologist's fallacy]] – an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.
* [[Direct reference theory|Referential fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics Glossary R, [http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~blue/xhx/books/semiotics/glossaryR/section81/main.html ''Referential fallacy or illusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; – assuming all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object or that the meaning of words often comes from how they are used.
* [[Reification (fallacy)|Reification]] (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) – a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity. In other words, it is the error of treating as a "real thing" something that is not a real thing, but merely an idea.
* [[Retrospective determinism]] – the argument that because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made its occurrence inevitable.
* [[Special pleading]] – a proponent of a position attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption.

=== Improper premise ===
* [[Begging the question]] (''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'') – providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/begging-the-question|title=Your logical fallacy is begging the question|work=Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html|title=Fallacy: Begging the Question|work=nizkor.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/61-begging-the-question|title=Begging the Question|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Begging-the-Question.html|title=Begging the Question|work=txstate.edu|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of [[begging the question]] fallacy.  When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion.  For example, an organic foods advertisement that says "Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives." Use of the term "unhealthy additives" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John D. Ramage|author2=John C. Bean|author3=June Johnson|title=Writing Arguments: A Rhetoric with Readings, Concise Edition, MLA Update Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-HEjwEACAAJ|year=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-458649-6|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in demonstrando}}'') – the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with; sometimes called ''assuming the conclusion''.
* [[Loaded question|Fallacy of many questions]] (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, ''{{lang|la|plurium interrogationum}}'') – someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda.

=== Faulty generalizations ===
[[Faulty generalization]] – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.
* [[Accident (fallacy)|Accident]] – an exception to a generalization is ignored.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=5}}
** [[No true Scotsman]] – makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample.{{sfn|Flew|1984|loc="No-true-Scotsman move"}}
* [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) – act of pointing at individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=155}}
** [[Survivorship bias]] – a small number of successes of a given process are actively promoted while completely ignoring a large number of failures
* [[False analogy]] – an [[argument by analogy]] in which the analogy is poorly suited.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=151}}
* [[Hasty generalization]] (fallacy of insufficient statistics, fallacy of insufficient sample, fallacy of the lonely fact, hasty induction, ''secundum quid'', converse accident, [[jumping to conclusions]]) – basing a broad conclusion on a small sample or the making of a determination without all of the information required to do so.{{sfn|Hurley|2007|p=134}}
* [[Inductive fallacy]] – A more general name to some fallacies, such as hasty generalization. It happens when a conclusion is made of premises that lightly support it.
* [[Misleading vividness]] – involves describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is an exceptional occurrence, to convince someone that it is a problem; this also relies on the [[appeal to emotion]] fallacy.
* [[Overwhelming exception]] – an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume.{{sfn|Fischer|1970|p=127}}
* [[Thought-terminating cliché]] – a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell [[cognitive dissonance]], conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. – but in any case, to end the debate with a cliché rather than a point.

=== Questionable cause ===
[[Questionable cause]] - Is a general type error with many variants.  Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation.  Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect.  
* ''{{lang|la|[[Cum hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "with this, therefore because of this"; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) – a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=41}}
** ''{{lang|la|[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]}}'' (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"; temporal sequence implies causation) – X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=180}}
** [[Wrong direction]] (reverse causation) – cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=135}} The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause.
** [[Ignoring a common cause]]
* [[Fallacy of the single cause]] (causal oversimplification{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=178}}) – it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.&lt;!-- Damer describes this in more general terms. --&gt;
* [[Furtive fallacy]] – outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers.
* [[Gambler's fallacy]] – the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is "due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails" is incorrect.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=186}}
** [[Inverse gambler's fallacy]]
* [[Magical thinking]] – fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In [[anthropology]], it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In [[psychology]], it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.
* [[Regression fallacy]] – ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of ''post hoc'' fallacy.

=== Relevance fallacies ===
* [[Appeal to the stone]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad lapidem}}'') – dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2709600|title=Johnson's Refutation of Berkeley: Kicking the Stone Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Argument from ignorance]] (appeal to ignorance, ''argumentum ad ignorantiam'') – assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false, or vice versa.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=165}}

==== Red herring fallacies ====
A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/redherrf.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Red Herring|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/red-herring/|title=Logical Fallacies|work=logicalfallacies.info|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red herring]] – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=208}} Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. ''See also [[ignoratio elenchi|irrelevant conclusion]].''
* ''{{lang|la|[[Ad hominem]]}}'' – attacking the arguer instead of the argument.
** ''[[Ad hominem#Circumstantial|Circumstantial ad hominem]]'' - stating that the arguers personal situation or perceived benefit from advancing a conclusion means that their conclusion is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/circumstantial-ad-hominem.html |title=Circumstantial Ad Hominem |author=Nizkor |accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[Abusive fallacy]] – verbally abusing the opponent rather than arguing about the originally proposed argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/10-ad-hominem-abusive|title=Ad Hominem (Abusive)|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to motive]] – dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer.
** [[Kafka-trapping]] – A sophistical and unfalsifiable form of argument that attempts to overcome an opponent by inducing a sense of guilt and using the opponent's denial of guilt as further evidence of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/wendy-mcelroy-beware-of-kafkatrapping/ |title= Beware of Kafkatrapping |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |date=14 August 2014 |website=The Daily Bell |access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Tone policing]] – focusing on emotion behind (or resulting from) a message rather than the message itself as a discrediting tactic.
** [[Ergo decedo|Traitorous critic fallacy]] (''{{lang|la|ergo decedo}}'', 'thus leave') – a critic's perceived affiliation is portrayed as the underlying reason for the criticism and the critic is asked to stay away from the issue altogether.  Easily confused with the [[association fallacy]] ("guilt by association"), below.
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it.{{sfn|Clark|Clark|2005|pp=13–16}}{{sfn|Walton|1997|p=28}} The term is also used more broadly to describe arguments that are not always fallacious; {{crossref|printworthy=y|see entry in the [[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]] section}}.
** [[Appeal to accomplishment]] – an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/19-appeal-to-accomplishment|title=Appeal to Accomplishment|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below).
** [[Courtier's reply]] – a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter.
* [[Appeal to consequences]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad consequentiam}}'') – the conclusion is supported by a premise that asserts positive or negative consequences from some course of action in an attempt to distract from the initial discussion.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=27}}
* [[Appeal to emotion]] – an argument is made due to the manipulation of emotions, rather than the use of valid reasoning.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=111}}

** [[Appeal to flattery]] – an argument is made due to the use of flattery to gather support.{{sfn|Gula|2002|p=12}}
** [[Appeal to pity]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad misericordiam}}'') – an argument attempts to induce pity to sway opponents.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=128}}
** [[Appeal to ridicule]] – an argument is made by incorrectly presenting the opponent's argument in a way that makes it appear ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_ridicule.htm|title=Appeal to Ridicule|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/42-appeal-to-ridicule|title=Appeal to Ridicule|author=Bo Bennett|work=logicallyfallacious.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Appeal to spite]] – an argument is made through exploiting people's bitterness or spite towards an opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_spite.htm|title=Appeal to Spite|work=changingminds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Judgmental language]] – insulting or pejorative language to influence the audience's judgment.

** [[Wishful thinking]] – a decision is made according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=146}}
* [[Appeal to nature]] – judgment is based solely on whether the subject of judgment is 'natural' or 'unnatural'.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adnature.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Appeal to Nature|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sometimes also called the "naturalistic fallacy", but is not to be confused with the other fallacies by that name.)
* [[Appeal to novelty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum novitatis}}'', ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatis}}'') – a proposal is claimed to be superior or better solely because it is new or modern.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=116}}
* [[Appeal to poverty]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad Lazarum}}'') – supporting a conclusion because the arguer is poor (or refuting because the arguer is wealthy). (Opposite of [[appeal to wealth]].){{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=104}}
* [[Appeal to tradition]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad antiquitatem}}'') – a conclusion supported solely because it has long been held to be true.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=14}}
* [[Appeal to wealth]] (''{{lang|la|argumentum ad crumenam}}'') – supporting a conclusion because the arguer is wealthy (or refuting because the arguer is poor).{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=39}} (Sometimes taken together with the [[appeal to poverty]] as a general appeal to the arguer's financial situation.)
* ''{{lang|la|[[Argumentum ad baculum]]}}'' (appeal to the stick, appeal to force, appeal to threat) – an argument made through coercion or threats of force to support position.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=106}}

* [[Association fallacy]] (guilt by association and honor by association) – arguing that because two things share (or are implied to share) some property, they are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/guiltbya.html|title=Logical Fallacy: Guilt by Association|author=Gary Curtis|work=fallacyfiles.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* {{lang|la|[[Ipse dixit]]}} (bare assertion fallacy) – a claim that is presented as true without support, as self-evidently true, or as dogmatically true. This fallacy relies on the implied expertise of the speaker or on an unstated truism.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179 "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0I-9gJN9rbwC&amp;pg=PA359 "John Dewey and American Democracy", p. 359].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;VanderMey, Randall ''et al.'' (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=l7I-ykFAC3cC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=bare+assertion+fallacy#v=onepage&amp;q=bare%20assertion%20fallacy ''Comp'', p. 183]; excerpt: "Bare assertion. The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bulverism]] (psychogenetic fallacy) – inferring why an argument is being used, associating it to some psychological reason, then assuming it is invalid as a result. The assumption that if the origin of an idea comes from a biased mind, then the idea itself must also be a falsehood.&lt;ref name="Fallacious Arguments" /&gt;
* [[Chronological snobbery]] – a thesis is deemed incorrect because it was commonly held when something else, known to be false, was also commonly held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidlavery.net/Barfield/Encyclopedia_Barfieldiana/Lexicon/Chronological.html|title=Encyclopedia Barfieldiana|work=davidlavery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021701/http://www.davidbergan.com/Summa/Chronological_snobbery |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{visible anchor|Fallacy of relative privation}} (also known as "appeal to worse problems" or "not as bad as") – dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument. [[First World problem]]s are a subset of this fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZXSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22first+world%22+%22relative+privation%22|title=All about Them: Grow Your Business by Focusing on Others|first=Bruce|last=Turkel|date=6 September 2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genetic fallacy]] – a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context.{{sfn|Damer|2009|p=93}}
* [[Moralistic fallacy]] – inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises, in violation of [[fact–value distinction]]; e.g. making statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. This is the inverse of the naturalistic fallacy.
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Naturalistic "Naturalistic"]}}&lt;ref name="nat-fal"&gt;{{cite web |work=TheFreeDictionary.com |title=Naturalistic fallacy |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/naturalistic+fallacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of [[fact–value distinction]].  ''Naturalistic fallacy'' in the stricter sense defined in the section "[[#Conditional or questionable fallacies|Conditional or questionable fallacies]]" (below) is a variety of this broader sense. Naturalistic fallacy (sometimes confused with [[appeal to nature]]) is the inverse of [[moralistic fallacy]].
** [[Is–ought problem|Is–ought fallacy]]{{sfn|Dowden|2010|loc=[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Is-Ought "Is-Ought"]}} – statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. 
* {{sic|hide=y|reason=This is not a typo; the naturalistic fallacy fallacy and the naturalistic fallacy are different.|''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy}}&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183201 How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is']", ''The Philosophical Review'', '''73''':1 (January 1964), 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; (anti-naturalistic fallacy)&lt;ref&gt;Alex Walter, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209025135/http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep043348.pdf The Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts]", ''Evolutionary Psychology'', '''4''' (2006), 33–48&lt;/ref&gt; – inferring an impossibility to infer any instance of ''ought'' from ''is'' from the general invalidity of ''is-ought fallacy'', mentioned above. For instance, ''is'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; does imply ''ought'' &lt;math&gt;P \lor \neg P&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, although the ''naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy would falsely declare such an inference invalid. ''Naturalistic fallacy'' fallacy is a type of [[argument from fallacy]].
* [[Straw man]] fallacy – an argument based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=22}}
* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]] – improperly asserting a cause to explain a cluster of data.{{sfn|Curtis|loc=[http://www.fallacyfiles.org/texsharp.html "The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy"]}}
* ''[[Tu quoque]]'' ('you too' – appeal to hypocrisy, [[whataboutism]]) – the argument states that a certain position is false or wrong or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with that position.{{sfn|Pirie|2006|p=164}}
* [[Two wrongs make a right]] – occurs when it is assumed that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will rectify it.{{sfn|Johnson|Blair|1994|p=122}}
* [[Vacuous truth]] – a claim that is technically true but meaningless, in the form of claiming that no ''A'' in ''B'' has ''C'', when there is no ''A'' in ''B''. For example, claiming that no mobile phones in the room are on when there are no mobile phones in the room at all.

== Conditional or questionable fallacies ==
* [[Appeal to authority]] (argument from authority, ''{{lang|la|argumentum ad verecundiam}}'') – a form of [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. The argument may actually be cogent when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. {{crossref|See the [[#Red herring fallacies|Red herring fallacies]] section, above, for the fallacious variant.}}
* [[Broken window fallacy]] – an argument that disregards lost opportunity costs (typically non-obvious, difficult to determine or otherwise hidden) associated with destroying property of others, or other ways of externalizing costs onto others. For example, an argument that states breaking a window generates income for a window fitter, but disregards the fact that the money spent on the new window cannot now be spent on new shoes.
* [[Definist fallacy]] – involves the confusion between two notions by defining one in terms of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Naturalistic Fallacy |first=W. K. |last=Frankena |work=Mind |volume=48 |date=October 1939 |pages=464–77 |publisher=Oxford University Press |jstor=2250706 |issue=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ends justify the means – an assertion that may or may not be defensible depending on the ends and means in question. The various approaches to this sort of question are the subject of the normative ethical theories of [[consequentialism]].
* [[Naturalistic fallacy]] – attempts to prove a claim about ethics by appealing to a definition of the term "good" in terms of either one or more claims about natural properties. The naturalistic fallacy also has a more general version, covered in the [[#Informal fallacies|"Red herring fallacies" section]], above.&lt;ref name="fallacyfiles.org" /&gt;
* [[Slippery slope]] (thin edge of the wedge, [[camel's nose]]) – asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact/event that should not happen, thus the first step should not happen. It is, in its essence, an appeal to probability fallacy.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=315}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">'''Marouflage''' is a technique for affixing a [[painting|painted]] canvas to a wall to be used as a [[mural]], using an adhesive that hardens as it dries such as [[plaster]] or [[cement]].

==History==
[[File:Cocarde IMG 2197.jpg|thumb|Interior sign of a Parisian pub, oil on canvas, marouflage on cardboard, ([[Musée de la Révolution française]])]]

A [[French language|French]] word originally referring to sticky, partly hardened scraps of paint, marouflage is a 3,000-year-old technique. Historically, artists used several types of adhesives including a [[rabbit-skin glue]]. [[White lead ore]] was used in the 19th and 20th centuries in the mixture to help it dry.

A thin coat of the [[adhesive]] is applied to both the wall and the [[canvas]]. Once the canvas is mounted to the wall, pressure is exerted with rubber hand rollers to smooth the canvas and remove any bubbles.

==Uses==
===Conservation===
In [[art conservation]], the word can be [[term of art]] meaning the removal of the painted surface from its underlying support, usually a stretched canvas. The process is more typically called transferring and can cause significant damage. Twenty-first century conservators seldom need to resort to this technique.

==Murals==
Intended murals are normally painted on large canvas in the studio and attached to the wall on site, using a starch based glue (applied to the wall only), the murals can then be moved (by a professional) and re-instated elsewhere if required.  The damage caused to the painting if removed using this technique is minimal.

'''Media and gender''' refers to the relationship between [[Media (communication)|media]] and [[gender]], and how gender is represented within [[media platform]]s. These platforms include but are not limited to [[film]], [[television]], [[journalism]], and [[video game]]s.
Initiatives and resources exist to promote [[gender equality]] and reinforce women's [[empowerment]] in the media industry and representations. For example, [[UNESCO]], in cooperation with the [[International Federation of Journalists]], elaborated the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media] contributing to [[gender equality]] and women's [[empowerment]] in all forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/|title=Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media: Framework of indicators to gauge gender sensitivity in media operations and content {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Feminism|Feminist]] writers, largely gaining prominence in the 1960s during [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]], began criticizing the [[Western canon]] for providing and promoting an exclusively white male [[world view]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Have We Got a Theory for You! Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and the Demand for "The Woman's Voice"|last=Lugones|first=Maria C.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists typically perceive gender as a social construct which is not only reflected in artistic work but perpetuated by it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism|last=Treichler|first=Paula|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently, feminists have mainly directed their studies to gender representations in literature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Gender disparity in media careers ==
Numbers of women in media professions, such as journalism, is growing; however, the media is and has been statistically dominated by men, who hold the vast majority of power positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.metiers-presse.org/explore.php#stack/alljournalists/journalistNumber/ageSlice/genderDistribution/none/2014/none|title=La répartition du nombre de journalistes par tranches d’âge et par sexe en 2014|work=Espace Data - Observatoire des métiers de la presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that men are more likely to be quoted than women in the media, and more likely to cover "serious" topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|title=The Problem|publisher=Women's Media Center|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210092107/http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|archivedate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bechdel test]], originally created to evaluate popular fiction's representation of women and subsequently adapted to employment in the media professions, show that a number of women are employed but do not benefit from an equal voice. For example, women's presence on [[radio]] is typically hired to cover topics such as weather and [[culture]].

In the [[video game industry]] about half of the [[gamer]]s are women but their presence is still limited in the production of games. Those who tried to publicly challenge this situation, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian|A. Sarkeesian]], have been subjected to harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=A.|year=2015|title="Everyone Can Make Games!": The post-feminist context of women in digital game production|url=https://zenodo.org/record/849069|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15|issue=4|pages=576–592|doi=10.1080/14680777.2014.958867}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cinema there is concern about the low number of female [[Film director|director]]s and the difficulties of older actresses to find roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|date=November 2, 2015|work=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-women-directors-20150222-story.html|title=Oscars 2015: Female directors scarce at Hollywood's major studios|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=February 22, 2015|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also earn 2.5 times less income than men in the same jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Smith L., Stacy|author2=Choueiti, Marc|author3=Pieper, Katherine|year=2014|title=Gender bias without borders: An investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries|url=https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/gender-bias-without-borders-full-report.pdf|publisher=Media, Diversity, &amp; Social Change Initiative. University of Southern California, Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Stacy Smith]] of the [[University of Southern California]] shows that only 7% of directors, 13% of [[writer]]s and 20% of [[Film producer|producer]]s in film and television are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theairspace.net/insight/gender-equality-in-the-media-the-new-social-movement/|title=Gender Equality in the Media: The New Social Movement|last1=McSweeney|first1=Melissa|website=The AirSpace|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Writers Guild, an estimated 17% of screenplays over the last decade were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Charlotte|date=2000|title=MOVIES; Her Type Is Strong, Not Silent; Susannah Grant is making waves in the male-dominated world of screenwriting with her latest films centering on determined women.: [Home Edition]|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/421663810?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing numbers of women work in the media as journalists or directors. Therefore, they deal with topics tightly related to women's needs and tend to provide a positive role for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender/gender-and-media/|title=Gender and media|author1=Ann Kangas|author2=Huma Haider|date=July 2015|publisher=GSDRC|author3=Erika Fraser|author4=Evie Browne}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer only consumers of media but also contributors to media, they get more involved in decision-making and agenda of activities. This empowerment of women gives them abilities to promote balance in gender representations and avoid stereotypes. Media becomes a suitable ground for expressions and claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender in the Information Society: Emerging Issues|author1=Pavarala, V.|author2=Malik, K. K.|author3=Cheeli, J.

== Representations of women ==

=== Underrepresentation ===
According to the report investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries, 1 woman for 2.24 men appeared on the screen between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2013. In 2009, the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (US)]] also found that men continue to make up the majority of roles, especially [[Supporting Roles|supporting roles]], where they contribute around two roles for every female role, whereas females hold a slightly larger proportion of [[lead role]]s compared to their proportion of supporting roles, but still less than lead roles occupied by male counterparts.

The same is true for [[television programs]]. In general, from the 1950s to the 1970s, television programs had 30-35% female roles in American TV shows.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction|last1=Gauntlett|first1=David|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-39661-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female roles increased in the 1980s, but there were still twice as many roles for men in television.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; However, these disparities change depending on the type of program: in mid-1970s [[sitcom]]s there were "nearly equal proportions", whereas in [[Action-adventure (disambiguation)|action-adventure shows]] "only 15 per cent of the leading characters were women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; In the 1980s, female characters represented 43% of roles in comedy shows and only 29% in action-adventure programs, however, they had outnumbered male characters two to one in dramas.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Since the 1990s, "gender roles on television seemed to become increasingly equal and non-stereotyped ... although the majority of lead characters were still male."&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] is an organisation that has been lobbying the industry for years to expand the roles of women in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as [[Clare Short]], Gaye Tuchman, and [[Angela McRobbie]] denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines.

=== Sexualization ===
The [[Western world|Western]] ideal of female beauty is that of the fit, young and thin woman, and the media spreads this ideal through movies, TV shows, [[fashion show]]s, advertisements, magazines and newspapers, music videos, and children's [[cartoon]]s. For women to be considered attractive, they have to conform to images in advertisements, television, and music portraying the ideal woman as tall, white, thin, with a 'tubular' body and blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=Female Body Image and the Mass Media: Perspectives on How Women Internalize the Ideal Beauty Standard|author=Serdar, K.L.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2016-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that typical female roles fall into cultural stereotypes of women and are often sexualized with minimal clothing and sexualized roles.&lt;ref name="Collins2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rebecca L.|date=2011|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9929-5|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a content analysis of video games found that "41% of female characters wore revealing clothing and an equal number were partially or totally nude", whereas the male characters were not.&lt;ref name="Downs2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|date=2010|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-009-9637-1|journal=Sex Roles|volume=62|issue=11|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[sexualization]] is not the only stereotypical way in which women are represented in the media.

In advertisement, celebrity endorsement of products are thought to be especially effective if the celebrity is a physically attractive woman, as the attractiveness is thought to transfer to the brand's image and studies have shown that audiences respond better to female endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan, Kara; Yu Leung Ng; Luk, Edwin K. Young Consumers; Bradford|first=|date=2013|title=Impact of celebrity endorsement in advertising on brand image among Chinese adolescents|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1365799498?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Emerald Publishing|volume=14|pages=167–179|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[objectification]] of women in the media is transmitted verbally and nonverbally, as well as directly and indirectly, and it is not only visual but can also be expressed subtly by commenting on women's appearance in a humorous way, making jokes and gags, and using double meanings.&lt;ref name="Galdi3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galdi|first1=Silvia|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|date=2014|title=Objectifying Media: Their Effect on Gender Role Norms and Sexual Harassment of Women|url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/38/3/398|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=398–413|doi=10.1177/0361684313515185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shows focused entirely on successful professional women and their "quests for sex, pleasure and romantic love", such as ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002) and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (1998–2004).&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Even if the main character in Ally McBeal was portrayed as desperate to find a husband, the show had other non-stereotypical female characters and "sided with the women".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;  ''Sex and the City'' had assertive female protagonists, especially in matters of sex, and did not punish them for wanting pleasure, knowing how to get it, and being determined to do so, which can be seen especially in the case of [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], played by [[Kim Cattrall]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Another female icon from the 1990s is the title character on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', a teenage girl who starred and became hugely popular in the "typically male-dominated world of [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] fans".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; [[Buffy Summers]], played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], was powerful, heroic, confident, and assertive, characteristics that were generally ascribed to male characters.

In her 1973 article "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]", feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term [[Male gaze|male-gaze]] to describe the way that women in film serve as projections of male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=1 October 1975|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|url=https://academic.oup.com/screen/article-abstract/16/3/6/1603296?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Screen|volume=16|pages=6–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestication ===
On TV, marriage, parenthood, and domesticity have been shown as more important to women than men.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; From the mid-1940s to the 1960s, women (predominantly white, middle-class women) were portrayed mostly as housewives who had seemingly "perfect" lives: their houses were always impeccably clean, their children were always healthy, and they were always beautiful and organized.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism and Pop Culture|last1=Zeisler|first1=Andi|date=2008|publisher=Seal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV didn't portray the reality that by 1960 "40 per cent of women worked outside the home ... [and that] divorce rates spiked twice after World War II".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; According to a study from 1975 conducted by Jean McNeil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Jean|date=1975|title=Feminism, Femininity and the Television Shows: A Content Analysis|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838157509363786|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|volume=19|issue=3|pages=259–269|doi=10.1080/08838157509363786}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 74 per cent of the cases studied women's interactions were "concerned with romance or family problems", whereas men's interactions were concerned with these matters in only 18 per cent of the cases.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; Furthermore, female characters often didn't have jobs, especially if they were wives and mothers, and were not the dominant characters or [[Decision-making|decision-makers]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt; The boss is usually a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.iwmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IWMF-Global-Report-Summary.pdf|title=Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media|author=Byerly, C. M.|publisher=International Women's Media Foundation|location=Washington DC|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are portrayed as more assertive or aggressive, adventurous, active, and victorious, whilst women are shown as passive, weak, ineffectual, victimized, supportive, and laughable.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett2" /&gt;

As one study about gender role portrayals in advertisements from seven countries' shows, women are more likely to play the role of the [[Housekeeping|housekeeper]] and men are more likely to play the roles of professionals.&lt;ref name="Paek2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paek|first1=Hye-Jin|last2=Nelson|first2=Michelle R.|last3=Vilela|first3=Alexandra M.|date=2011|title=Examination of Gender-role Portrayals in Television Advertising across Seven Countries|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-010-9850-y|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=192–207|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9850-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, Souha R. Ezzedeen found that career-driven female characters in film are often portrayed as failing at fulfilling the stereotypical roles of a woman, like sexual attraction, maternal roles, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezzedeen|first=Souha R.|date=2015|title=Portrayals of career women in Hollywood films: implications for the glass ceiling's persistence|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1675843005?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:wcdiscovery&amp;accountid=11411|journal=Gender in Management|volume=30|pages=239–264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age gap ===

Older characters and actors in general tend to be underrepresented in most media; however, this seems to specifically effect female actors who appear less frequently in film and television than their male colleagues and younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/is-2015-the-year-of-the-older-actress-203907/|title=Is 2015 the Year of the Older Actress?|last=Berger|first=Laura|date=April 22, 2015|work=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 40+ male roles are on the rise in both theatrical and television productions, female 40+ roles represent only 28% of female roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/press-releases/october-23-2009/latest-casting-data-follows-historical-trends-and-continues-exclude-p|title=Latest casting data follows historical trends and continues to exclude people with disabilities|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=Screen Actors Guild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors such as [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] continue to undertake major roles as ageless heroes, whereas the normative structure for older women is that their ageing is part of the plot (for example in ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008) and [[Sex and the City (film)|''Sex and the City'']] (2010)).&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairclough|first1=K|year=2012|title=Nothing less than perfect: female celebrity, ageing and hyper-scrutiny in the gossip industry|url=http://doi.org/10.1080/19392397.2012.644723|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=90–103|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644723}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically seen in relation to female roles relying on sexualization and the superficial (apparent) effects of aging on their body are presented as something to be hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Calasanti, Toni|author2=Kathleen F.

This has led to critiques that these representations are first and foremost framed in terms of how well older actresses are managing their aging bodies.&lt;ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /&gt; Midlife women have grown accustomed to seeing their age group portrayed in a seemingly unrealistic way, and this had led to an increase of eating disorders and negative body image among this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hefner|first=Veronica|date=Summer 2014|title=The Influence of Television and Film Viewing on Midlife Women's Body Image, Disordered Eating, and Food Choice|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=65fa7055-cd70-453b-8863-f0b372478d63%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=95678398&amp;db=ufh|journal=Media and Psychology|volume=17|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.838903|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one court case in 2011, English television actress [[Miriam O'Reilly]] successfully sued the [[BBC]] for [[age discrimination]] after being dropped from a show. It was claimed that she had been told to be careful about her wrinkles and to consider [[Botulinum toxin|Botox]] and dyeing her hair.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt;

The commercial potential of older consumers is becoming more significant (an increased 'active [[lifespan]]', the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] generation entering retirement, retirement ages that are raising). A multiplication of images of successful aging are explicitly tied to consumerism by the anti-ageing industry and older female celebrities advertising their products.&lt;ref name="doi.org2" /&gt; Examples abound: [[Sharon Stone]] for [[Christian Dior]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Julianna Margulies]] for [[L'Oreal]], [[Christy Turlington]] for [[Maybelline]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] for [[CoverGirl]], etc. These advertisements are paradoxical in that they allow older celebrities to remain visible while encouraging an ageist and [[Sexism|sexist]] culture in which women are valued for their appearance. Baby boomers are an increasingly important audience group for the cinema industry, resulting in more and new kinds of stories with older [[protagonist]]s. [[Romantic comedy|Romantic comedies]] in which women protagonists take on the [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[hero]]ine role provide one of the few spaces in [[popular culture]] showing appealing representations of older women, such as ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007), ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' (2008), and ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009). They are part of a phenomenon called the "girling" of older women, where the protagonists and celebrities are portrayed as being just as excited and entitled to be going out on dates as younger women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Glorious, glamorous and that old standby, amorous": the late blossoming of Diane Keaton's romantic comedy career|journal=Celebrity Studies|publisher=|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse ===
Heterosexual romantic relationships in media, particularly in film, often romanticize intimate partner violence wherein the woman is the victim. Films like [[Twilight (2008 film)|''Twilight'']] (2008), ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Gray]]'' (2015), and ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'' (1994) are all examples of films in which abusive behavior, such as manipulation, coercion, threats, control and domination, isolation, excessive jealousy, and physical violence, are all exhibited by the male romantic lead.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, Amy E., et al. “The Abuse Litmus Test: A Classroom Tool to Assess Power and Control in On-Screen Relationships.” Family Relations, vol. 66, no. 1, Feb. 2017, pp. 154–165. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/fare.12237.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on women's interpretations of abusive behavior found that many women see the sort of abusive behaviors shown in popular films as romantic or desirable. This conflation of abuse and romance is widely attributed to the prevalence of abusive tropes in popular media. &lt;ref&gt;Papp, Leanna, et al. “The Dark Side of Heterosexual Romance: Endorsement of Romantic Beliefs Relates to Intimate Partner Violence.” Sex Roles, vol. 76, no. 1–2, Jan. 2017, pp. 99–109. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1007/s11199-016-0668-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female characters as plot devices for male characters ===
====Referred Pain====
In media featuring a male protagonist, women’s pain, suffering, or even death are often used as plot devices to further the male protagonist’s narrative arc. This is known as the “referred pain” plot device. It involves a situation wherien a woman undergoes a traumatic event, often (but not always) of a sexual nature, but her pain is referred to a male character. This male character’s grief and anger due to the trauma experienced by the female character are explored in depth.  The female character’s emotional or physical response is only addressed briefly or cursorily. This trope is featured in such films as [[Mission: Impossible 2|''Mission: Impossible 2'' (2000)]], [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'' (2001)]], as well as in the Shakespeare play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and books like ''[[Oroonoko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Åström |first1=Berit |title=Referred pain: privileging male emotions in narrative instances of female physical suffering |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |year=2011 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125-137 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.565193 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09589236.2011.565193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Disposable Woman====
The Disposable Woman trope refers to a trope in which a woman is included in a story for the sole purpose of dying, thus putting the male protagonist through emotional development or inspiring him to embark on a revenge quest. The woman who dies in these situations is referred to as "disposable" because she does not serve a purpose beyond her death. The disposable woman trope in present in many films, including ''[[Braveheart (1995 film)|Braveheart'' (1995)]], [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003)]], ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)]], ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight'' (2008)]], ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)]], ''[[Deadpool 2|Deadpool 2'' (2018)]], and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disposable Woman |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman |website=TVtropes |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== [[Manic Pixie Dream Girl|The Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] ====

== Representations of men ==
Men are proportionally represented by media more often compared to women, but the representations that do exist are often criticized for their portrayal of sexist stereotypes. Most critics discuss the ways male characters in film and television are typically more tough, aggressive, domineering, etc than the average man they are meant to represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender|last=Wood|first=Julia T.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text='[[Masculinity|Masculine]]' means the male who fits in with [[Society of the United States|American society]]'s stereotypical 'manly man', or a handsome (according to current [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]) man with definite muscles, and a conservative style of dress and hairdo. The inadequate male lacks many characteristics of the masculine male. He is weak and fearful, lacking both physical stamina and any significant amount of courage. This was demonstrated in the cartoons analyzed not only through actions but also by body type and bone structure, as well as dress and hairstyle. The delicate female was patterned in the cartoons studied as a woman of delicate physical structure, who is thin and dressed in such a manner as would not allow her to complete tasks traditionally meant for males. The modern female is one who is dressed in a more neutral fashion, such as jeans or pants, and does not have a noticeably tiny waistline.|author=Kelly Eick|source="Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons"&lt;ref name="Eick"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/495/paper1.html|title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons|website=Dr. Rubba's Home Page: English 495 Topics in Applied Language Study|publisher=California Polytechnic State University|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}}}

Media representations of sports and athletes contribute to the construction of a dominant model of [[masculinity]] centered on strength and an ambivalent relationship to [[violence]], encouraging boys and men to take risks and to be aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messner|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Michele|last3=Hunt|first3=Darnell|author-link3=Darnell Hunt|date=November 2000|title=The televised sports manhood formula|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723500244006|journal=[[Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues]]|publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=380&amp;ndash;394|doi=10.1177/0193723500244006|postscript=.|ref=harv|author-link1=Michael Messner}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/manhood-formula.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In advertising, men usually promote alcoholic beverages, banking services, credit cards, or cars. Although women also promote cars, advertisements involving women are usually highly dependent on their [[sexuality]], which is not the case for those with men, who are shown in these ads in an elegant and powerful way. Also, when men are acting on a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]], they are usually performing activities such as playing sports, driving around girls, repairing cars, drinking, relaxing, and having fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Advertising|author=Bartos, R.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2000|editor=J. Jones|location=US|pp=103–117|chapter=Women as advertising target}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when a man is promoting on an advertisement, they usually speak about the product and do not use it.

Film historian [[Miriam Hansen]] argues the way [[female gaze]] came to film during the [[flapper]] films of the 1920s, specifically citing the famous Italian-American actor [[Rudolph Valentino]] as having been used on the screen to draw in a female audience as an embodiment of male beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=November 10, 2016|title=From a faculty seminar with Laura Mulvey: reflections on visual pleasure|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17400309.2017.1377923?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=New Review of Film and Television Studies|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginie Julliard and Nelly Quemener remark that even though the dominant conception of sexuality in media is [[heterosexuality]] with [[construction]] of [[tradition]]al models of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], sexually diverse versions are being used in media which can also be a source of identification by the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/693|title=Le genre dans la communication et les médias : enjeux et perspectives|author1=Virginie Julliard|author2=Nelly Quemener|date=2014-01-15|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a U.S. [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[media monitoring]] organization called [[GLAAD]] was founded by [[Vito Russo]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], and Lauren Hinds with the support of other [[LGBT]] people in the media to combat media discrimination.

Studies have found that exposure to objectifying media can be linked to increased probability of male viewers engaging in sexual harassment, abuse, or acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Galdi3" /&gt;

In the U.S., for example, exposure to TV has been associated with "more stereotypical sexual attitudes [like the idea that men are sex-driven and the notion that women are sexual objects] and evaluation styles". Also popular is the idea that appearance or sexiness is essential for men and women.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt; Additionally, pop music and music videos have been shown to increase stereotypical gender schemas, and promote the ideas that gender relationships are adversarial and that appearance is fundamental.&lt;ref name="Bogt2" /&gt;

The stereotyped portrayals of men and women have been argued to be valued and internalized by younger viewers, especially during puberty and the construction of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raja Mujtaba|date=January 18, 2011|title=Mass media and its influence on society|work=Opinion Maker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body image ===
There are many studies that aim to prove that sexual objectification is the root cause of body image issues. One 1995 study intended to prove that sexual advertising contributes to body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinberg|first=Leslie|date=1995|title=Body Image and Televised Images of Thinness and Attractiveness: A Controlled Laboratory Investigation|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=14|pages=325–338|doi=10.1521/jscp.1995.14.4.325|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred and thirty nine women were involved. They were split into two groups: The first group where the women watched an advert that showed attractive women. The second part where they showed adverts that were non-appearance related. The results showed the group of women that watched the appearance related advertisement experienced feelings of depression and body dissatisfaction.

Relationships between media exposure and personal concepts of body image have also been increasingly explored. ''[[Psychology Today]]'' conducted a survey and observed that "of 3,452 women who responded to this survey, 23% indicated that movie or television celebrities influenced their body image when they were young, and 22% endorsed the influence of fashion magazine models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

A study conducted in 2015 by the Department of Communication at [[University of Missouri]] tested the potential impact of gendered depictions of women in the superhero movie genre on female undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennell|first=Hillary|last2=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Elizabeth|date=2015-03-01|title=The Empowering (Super) Heroine?

Factors involved in the composition of self-image include the emotional, physical, and reasoning aspects of a person, and these aspects affect one another.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legenbauer|first=Tanja|date=May 2008|title=Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=32|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/0145445507309027|pmid=18391052|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main contributors to negative body image is the fact that forms of media like commercials and magazines promotes the "thin ideal".&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; From seeing images of women with extremely thin bodies, some people have an increase of negative emotions, and these individuals tend to take actions like dieting to help relieve the undesirable feelings about their body image.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This act of dieting could lead to dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders if the negative perceptions about one's body image does not improve.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Considering that an average North American will watch about 35,000 commercials a year, it is to be expected that commercials presenting images of skinny and gorgeous women will have a bigger impact on increasing negative body image, than ads in magazines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The author of "Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State", Tanja Legenbauer, conducted a study in order to demonstrate that images presented in commercials can lead to harmful effects in those that watch them. &amp;nbsp;Her study included participants who looked at different silhouettes of differently shaped women, and their response to these images was reviewed. These participants included those with and without eating disorders, and usually those participants with eating disorders reacted more negatively to the images presented to them in the study.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

One explanation for why TV shows could negatively affect body image is the idea of the "third" person. The "third" person idea explains that women can start to develop negative body image because they are constantly seeing images of thin and beautiful women on TV.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonhyeung|date=October 2008|title=Third-Person Effects of Idealized Body Image in Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|pages=147–164|doi=10.1177/0002764208321348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From seeing these images, they realize that men are seeing these same women and thinking that those images are the standards for a perfect or ideal woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Body image can be defined as the perception of how one sees themselves and whether or not they are happy with what they are seeing. This image of oneself can be positively or negatively affected by the opinions of those that matter to the person.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; When a woman thinks about the "third person", the gender and relationship of the "third person" to the woman can change the amount of impact their opinion has on the woman.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; So, an example would be if a woman knows that her boyfriend is seeing these images of lean and beautiful women, her boyfriend's opinion can more negatively affect how she sees herself and her body than if she thinks about a female stranger seeing the same images.

Eating disorders are presumed to mainly affect teenage girls, but they are starting to become more common in middle aged women. When women want to work on bettering their health or when they want to get into shape, they often look to fitness or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willis|first=Laura E.|date=April 2014|title=Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health and Fitness Magazines|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=29|pages=323–331|doi=10.1080/10410236.2012.755602|pmid=23844558|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem with women looking towards health magazines for help is that these magazines are often filled with images of women who are in their 40s and 50s, but are very lean and beautiful.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In order to establish that these health magazines are having a negative impact on body image in the readers of the magazines, Laura E. Willis, the author of "Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health", conducted a study. She looked at issues of five different health and fitness magazines, and realized that these magazines tend to focus more on appearance rather than health, and focused on reducing caloric intake rather than exercise.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The messages presented in these magazines can cause a negative perception of oneself, and instead of motivating people to better themselves, they have the ability to make the reader feel bad about their body.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Growing lack of "strong" male characters ===
Some critics have expressed fears of the growing trend of female protagonists with less important male counterparts used for support and comic relief, and specifically the effects this will have on [[Generation Z]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-media-is-redefining-men-and-how-men-are-redefining_us_59b18166e4b0c50640cd657f|title=How Media is Redefining Men and How Men are Redefining Media|last=Myers|first=Jack|date=Nov 7, 2017|work=Huffington Post|access-date=March 27, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses and movements for change ==
=== Feminist response ===
[[Germaine Greer]], Australian-born author of [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Female-Eunuch-Germaine-Greer/dp/006157953X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458435668&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+female+eunuch+by+germaine+greer|title=The Female Eunuch|last1=Greer|first1=Germaine|date=1970|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=978-0061579530}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, [[Sharon Smith (writer)|Sharon Smith]] wrote on the first issue of ''Women and Film'' that women's roles in film "almost always [revolve] around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters" in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Sharon|title=The Image of Women in Film: Some Suggestions for Future Research|journal=Women and Film|issue=1|pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to [[feminist film theory]], argued that "the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions".&lt;ref name="Rosen2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popcorn Venus|last1=Rosen|first1=Marjorie|date=1973|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of [[symbolic annihilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media|last1=Tuchman|first1=Gaye|last2=Kaplan Daniels|first2=Arlene|last3=Benét|first3=James|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195023527|ref=Tuchman}}&lt;/ref&gt; blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives.

From media representations, feminists paved the way for debates and discussions about gender within the social and political spheres. In 1986, the British MP Clare Short proposed a bill to ban newspapers from printing [[Page 3]] photographs of topless models.&lt;ref name="Biscarrat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/619|title=L'analyse des médias au prisme du genre : formation d'une épistémè|author=Laetitia Biscarrat|date=2013|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue française des sciences de l'information et de la communication|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/clare-short-i-didnt-get-rid-of-page-3-can-leveson-6294455.html|title=I didn't get rid of Page 3 &amp;ndash; Can Levenson?|author=Clare Short|accessdate=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, feminist critics began analyzing film in terms of the Bechdel test. This feminist assessment of cinema was named after [[Alison Bechdel]], feminist cartoonist and creator of the long-running comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. This test determines the level of gender equality present in a film by assessing whether a work of&amp;nbsp;[[fiction]]&amp;nbsp;features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bechdeltest.com/|title=Bechdel Test Movie List|website=bechdeltest.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, TV critics, academics, and women started to point out the way TV shows portrayed female characters.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3"/&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine called out the industry for "refusing to rise above characterizations of women as pretty, skinny, dopey, hapless housewives or housewife wannabes", and a poll conducted by ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine in 1972 showed that "75 per cent of 120,000 women ... agreed that 'the media degrades women by portraying them as mindless dolls'".&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt; In that sense, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' was a television breakthrough because it introduced the first female character whose central relationships were not her husband or boyfriend or her family, but her friends and coworkers. The main character was a sort of stand-in for the "new American female" who put her job before romance and preferred to be alone than with the wrong men, but still had to do stereotypically female office work (like typing and getting coffee) and didn't speak up to her boss and other male coworkers.&lt;ref name="Zeisler3" /&gt;

=== International Organization and NGO response ===
==== UN Women ====
[[UN Women]] is the [[United Nations|UN]] organization dedicated to [[gender equality]] and the [[empowerment]] of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women|title=About UN Women|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes, it's important to give women the right place in media landscape, and their representations must be fair and equal. UN Women supports media monitoring studies on how women are depicted in the media. For instance, the organisation "engage media professionals by raising awareness of gender equality and violence against women, including through special workshops and tool-kits, to encourage gender-sensitive reporting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women/2014/media|title=Women and media|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UNESCO ====
In line with UNESCO's [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/ Global Priority Gender], "[[UNESCO]] is contributing to achieving full [[gender equality]] in the media by 2030".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-pluralism-and-gender-equality|title=Media Diversity and Gender Equality|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach this goal, the Organization developed the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media (GSIM)] to measure gender awareness and portrayal within media organizations (e.g. working conditions), but particularly in editorial content. The Organization has been promoting their application by governments, media organizations, journalists unions and associations, journalism schools and the like. They set the basis for gender equality in media operations and editorial content. In addition, each year, UNESCO organizes a campaign named "[https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews Women Make the News]"; in 2018 the theme was ''Gender Equality and Sports Media'' as "Sports coverage is hugely powerful in shaping norms and [[stereotype]]s about [[gender]]. Media has the ability to challenge these norms, promoting a balanced coverage of men's and women's sports and a fair portrayal of sportspeople irrespective of gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews|title=Women Make the News 2018|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geena Davis Institute ====
The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] advocates for gender equality in media. It is a NGO specialized in researches on gender representation in media. It advocates for equal representation of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-12|title=Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geena_Davis_Institute_on_Gender_in_Media&amp;oldid=830135727|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes

'''Medium theory''' is the name assigned to a variety of approaches used to examine how the means of expression of human communication impact the meaning(s) of human communication(s).

[[Joshua Meyrowitz]] originated the term in his 1985 book, ''No Sense of Place''.  Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1963, 1966, 1988) and [[Neil Postman]] (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German [[media theory]] operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia.

Joshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305).

==McLuhan's message==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is best known for his phrase "the medium is the message". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. "McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit."

==Technological determinism== 
Medium theory has always been criticized by its [[technological determinism]]. [[Raymond Williams]] is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it.
The deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although [[McLuhan]] strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.

The acronym, NAME, originally stood for the ''Nuclear Accident ModEl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The U.K. nuclear accident model| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014919709190043O| journal=[[Progress in Nuclear Energy]]| date=1991|issn=0149-1970|pages=85–104| volume=26|issue=2|doi=10.1016/0149-1970(91)90043-O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met Office has revised and upgraded the model over the years and it is now used as a general purpose dispersion model. The current version is known as the '''NAME III''' (''Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modeling Environment'') model. NAME III is currently{{when|date=May 2018}} operational and it will probably completely replace the original NAME model sometimes in 2006.

==Features and capabilities of NAME==

NAME (in its current NAME III version) is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian]] [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion model]] for short range to global range scales. It employs 3-dimensional meteorological data provided by the Met Office's ''Unified National Weather Prediction Model''. [[Random walk]] techniques using [[empirical]] [[turbulence]] profiles are utilized to represent turbulent mixing. In essence, NAME follows the 3-dimensional trajectories of parcels of the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollution plume]] and computes pollutant concentrations by [[Monte Carlo method]]s — that is, by direct simulation rather than solving equations.&lt;ref name=1996Gazette/&gt;

NAME uses a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|puff]] technique when modelling dispersion over a short range which shortens the time needed to compute the pollutant concentrations at the receptors.

The model has the capability to calculate: the rise of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|buoyant plumes]]; deposition of pollution plume components due to rainfall (i.e., [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet deposition]]); [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dry deposition]]; plume chemistry focusing on sulphate and nitrate chemistry; plume depletion via the decay of radioactive materials; the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|downwash effects]] of buildings.&lt;ref name=MOSAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=1996Gazette/&gt;

The model can also be run 'backwards' to generate maps that locate possible plume originating sources.

==The Met Office's commitments to emergency response service==

The Met Office has international commitments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EMS2006/00567/EMS2006-A-00567.pdf Met Office Emergency Response Capability]&lt;/ref&gt;  to provide emergency response dispersion modelling services for releases of hazardous gases and materials into the atmosphere. Such events include the release of radioactive materials and emissions from erupting volcanoes. Those commitments are met by an operational group known as EMARC who are supported by a Met Office team of dispersion modelling staff. That team is also responsible for the scientific development of NAME III which, combined with the Met Office numerical weather prediction model, is used to provide the  dispersion modelling services needed to implement the listed commitments:

*The [[WMO]] (''World Meteorological Office'') has designated the Met Office to operate one of the worldwide RSMCs (''Regional Specialist Meteorological Centre'')
*The Met Office has also been designated a [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Center|VAAC]] (''Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre'') which is part of the IAVW (''International Airways Volcano Watch'') set up by the [[ICAO]] (''International Civil Aviation Organization'').

Over the years, NAME has been applied to radioactive releases, the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]], major industrial fires and chemical spills, and two [[Volcanism in Iceland|volcanic eruptions in Iceland]].&lt;ref name=2000Gazette/&gt;

The term may also denote a general conception of a post-democratic system that may involve other structures of [[group decision-making]] and [[governance]] than the ones found in contemporary or historical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Joanna|last2=Long|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Moore|first3=Henrietta L.|title=The State We're In: Reflecting on Democracy's Troubles|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781785332258|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zlSNCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Popescu|first1=Delia|title=Political Action in Václav Havel's Thought: The Responsibility of Resistance|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739149577|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ToGGaQ0dabgC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fonte|first1=John|title=Democracy’s Trojan Horse|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/56-4-Democracys%20Trojan%20Horse.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
By Crouch's definition:&lt;ref name="LSEpd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five minutes with Colin Crouch|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/five-minutes-with-colin-crouch/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"A post-democratic society is one that continues to have and to use all the institutions of democracy, but in which they increasingly become a formal shell. The energy and innovative drive pass away from the democratic arena and into small circles of a politico-economic elite."}}

Crouch states that we are not "living in a post-democratic society, but that we were moving towards such a condition".&lt;ref name="LSEpd"/&gt;

== Causes ==
Crouch names the following reasons:
* '''No common goals:''' For people in the [[post-industrial society]] it is increasingly difficult, in particular for the [[underclass]], to identify themselves as a group and therefore difficult to focus on [[Political party|political parties]] that represent them. For instance [[laborer]]s, [[farmer]]s or [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] no longer feel attracted to one political movement and this means that there is no common goal for them as a group to get united.
* '''[[Globalization]]:''' The effect of globalization makes it almost impossible for nations to work out their own economic policy. Therefore, large [[trade agreement]]s and [[supranational union]]s (e.g., the [[European Union]]) are used to make policy but this level of politics is very hard to control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows [[Multinational_corporation|transnational corporations]] with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect domestic economies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Post-Democracy|last = Crouch|first = |publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Non-balanced debates:''' In most democratic countries the positions of the political parties have become very much alike. This means that there is not much to choose from for its voters. The effect is that [[political campaign]]s are looking more like [[advertising]] to make the differences look bigger. Also the private lives of the politicians have become an important item in elections. Sometimes "sensitive" issues stay undiscussed. The English conservative journalist [[Peter Oborne]] presented a documentary of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], arguing that it had become [[Aristocracy (government)|anti-democratic]] because it targeted a number of [[floating voters]] with a narrow agenda.
* '''Entanglement between public and private sector:''' There are large shared interests between politics and business. Through [[lobbying]] companies, [[multinational corporations]] are able to bring about [[legislation]] more effectively than the inhabitants of a country. Corporations and governments are in close relation because states need corporations as they are great employers. But as much of the production is [[outsourcing|outsourced]], and corporations have almost no difficulty in moving to other countries, labor law becomes employee-unfriendly and tax bites are moved from companies to individuals. It becomes more common for politicians and managers to switch jobs (the 'revolving door').
* '''[[Privatization]]:''' Then there is the neoliberal idea of [[new public management]] ([[neoliberalism]]) of privatizing public services. Privatized institutions are difficult to control by democratic means and have no allegiance to human communities, unlike government. Crouch uses the term “phantom firms” to describe the flexibility and elusive nature of firms which bend to the market. He concludes that private firms have incentive to make individual profit rather than better the welfare of the public. For example, he states that there is a problem with pharmaceutical companies funding (and skewing) medical research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
As a consequence:
* Fewer voters use their right to vote, or do vote but don't expect much.
* Politicians can ignore an undesirable outcome of a [[referendum]] or [[opinion poll]]. For instance in 2005 when [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] voted ''No'' at a referendum about the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] these countries still ratified the treaty after only minor modifications were made.
* The rise of [[xenophobic]] and other [[populist]] parties who capitalise on prevailing discontent. 
* Foreign governments can influence the internal politics of a sovereign country. According to Crouch, the way the [[eurozone crisis]] was handled is the best example of how things work in a post-democracy. European leaders managed to bring about a new government taking office in [[Italy]], and in [[Greece]] far-reaching [[austerity]] measures were put in place, contrary to the vote in a popular referendum.
* Private interest becomes increasingly influential in public policy.

== Solutions ==
{{See also|Online participation|LiquidFeedback|Collective problem solving}}
According to Crouch there is an important task for [[social media]] in which voters can participate more actively in [[public debate]]s. In addition, these voters would have to join [[advocacy groups]] for specific interests. The citizens have to reclaim their place in decision making. He calls this post-post-democracy.

The [[Occupy movement]] was a form of more or less disorganized opposition that grew out of the dissatisfaction with to the power of the [[bank]]ing industry.

'''Public awareness of science''' ('''PAwS'''), '''public understanding of science''' ('''PUS'''), or more recently, '''Public Engagement with Science and Technology''' ('''PEST''') are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages [[science]], [[technology]], and [[innovation]] have among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savaget|first1=Paulo|last2=Acero|first2=Liliana|title=Plurality in understandings of innovation, sociotechnical progress and sustainable development: An analysis of OECD expert narratives|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=2017|doi=10.1177/0963662517695056}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the [[information deficit model]] of [[science communication]], the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public [[uses and gratifications theory|chooses to use]] scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between [[expertise|expert]] and [[layperson|lay]] understandings of an issue.{{examples|date=October 2015}}

== Major themes ==
The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as:
* [[Science communication]] in the [[mass media]], [[Internet]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programmes
* [[Science museums]], [[aquarium|aquaria]], [[planetarium|planetaria]], [[zoo|zoological parks]], [[botanical garden]]s, etc.
* Public controversies over science and technology
* Fixed and mobile science exhibits
* [[Science festival]]s
* [[Science fair]]s in schools and social groups
* [[Science education]] for adults
* Science and [[social movement]]s
* Media and science ([[Mediatization (media)|medialisation]] of science)
* [[Consumer education]]
* [[Citizen science]]
* Public tours of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) parks, manufacturing companies, etc.
* [[Science in popular culture]]
* Science in text books and classrooms
* Science and art

How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[bioethics]], etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Divided Expectations: Why We Need a New Dialogue about Science, Inequality, and Society |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18-19 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619185052/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/divided_expectations |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bodmer report==
The publication of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]]' report ''The Public Understanding of Science&lt;ref name=RS-Bodmer-report&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Royal Society|title=The Public Understanding of Science|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/1985/public-understanding-science/|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' (or ''Bodmer Report'') in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report led to the foundation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contextualist model ==
In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of [[Cumbria]]n Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in [[England]], where [[Brian Wynne]] demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wynne|first=Brian|date=1996|chapter=Misunderstood Misunderstandings: Social Identities and the Public Uptake of Science|url=|editors=Alan Irwin and Brian Wynne |title=Misunderstanding Science? The Public Reconstruction of Science and Technology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19–46|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)]]. The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the  bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.

== The deliberative turn ==
The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science  through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like [[Sheila Jasanoff]] argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasanoff|first=Sheila|date=2003|title=Breaking the Waves in Science Studies: Comment on H.M. Collins and Robert Evans, 'The Third Wave of Science Studies'|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=389–400|doi=10.1177/03063127030333004|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lövbrand, Eva, Roger Pielke, Jr. and Silke Beck|first=|date=2011|title=A Democracy Paradox in Studies of Science and Technology|url=|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=474–496|doi=10.1177/0162243910366154|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring public understanding of science ==
Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:

=== 1. Factual knowledge ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list&lt;ref name="Eveland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eveland|first1=William|title=How Web Site Organization Influences Free Recall, Factual Knowledge, and Knowledge Structure Density|journal=Human Communications Research|volume=30|issue=2|pages=208–233|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00731.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Cued Recall]]: Answering a specific question without a list of choices &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Free Recall]]: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== 2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Scaled survey responses to questions such as "How well informed you would say you are about this topic?"&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge? Comparing operationalizations of scientific understanding|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=39|pages=761–774|doi=10.1093/scipol/scs048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one’s knowledge &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;

=== 3. Structural knowledge: ===
The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an “X” in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
* Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as “I tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences” &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key Assumptions: ====
* The use of [[Elaborative interrogation|elaboration]] increases the likelihood of remembering information &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== Mixed use of the three measures ===
* While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they “do not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures." &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt; Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;
* Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

== Project examples ==
Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as [[Dana Foundation]]'s "[[Brain Awareness Week]]," are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science.

The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAWS off science?|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1998|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/33/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vega Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk|title=The Vega Science Trust - Science Video - Homepage|work=vega.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public.

The [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science]] chair at [[The University of Oxford]] was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|title=Professor Richard Dawkins - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025233/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]]. Mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|title=Professor Marcus du Sautoy - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181656/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|archivedate=2010-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including [[Richard Fortey]] and [[Kathy Sykes]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] at [[Manchester University]], [[Tanya Byron]] at [[Edge Hill University]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and [[Alice Roberts]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Reading for the Future''' ('''RFF''') is an international group which encourages [[literacy]] and [[Reading (activity)|reading]] through the use of [[speculative fiction]]. Some regional groups collect new and used books which are then distributed free of charge to schools and libraries. For many rural schools, this is the only way they get new books. 

RFF does not have a central organization but is rather a series of [[grassroots]] groups. Developing the Young Reader (DYR) associated with RFF in April 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">The '''Royal Musical Association''' ('''RMA''') is a British [[learned society|scholarly society]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]]. Founded in 1874, the Association claims to be the second oldest musicological society in the world, after that of the Netherlands. Activities include organizing and sponsoring academic conferences in the UK, and making awards for outstanding scholarship, notably the annual [[Dent Medal]].

==History==
The society was founded by Sir [[John Stainer]] and was originally titled the Musical Association with a subtitle 'the investigation and discussion of subjects connected with the Art and Science of Music'. Sir [[Frederick Ouseley]], Stainer's teacher, was the first president. The Association was registered as a company in 1904 and as a charity in 1965. The Association was renamed the Royal Musical Association in 1944 following the orders of King [[George VI]].

==Publications==
The Association publishes the ''[[Journal of the Royal Musical Association]]'' ([http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=t794546064~tab=issueslist eJournal]). Before 1987 the ''Journal'' was known as the ''Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association'' (often abbreviated PMRA; {{ISSN|0080-4452}} and {{ISSN search link|1471-6933}}), and before 1945 as the ''Proceedings of the Musical Association'' (see {{OCLC|630055862}} for print holdings from 1878 to 1986). The RMA has also published a series of [[monograph]]s and the ''Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle'' that has generally come out yearly since 1961, published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rrmc20 | title=Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]| accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4782">'''Rudi Lissau''', born 26 June 1911 in [[Vienna]] and died 30 January 2004 in [[Brookthorpe]], United Kingdom, was a Steiner school teacher, author, lecturer and anthroposophist.

==Biography==

Rudolf Lissau’s parents were both of Jewish origin but had become students of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and founded, together with an uncle, the Viennese branch of the [[Theosophical Society]] as a forum for his work in Vienna. Rudolf Steiner visited the family in their home from time to time. Rudi was impressed by the obvious awe in which his parents held Steiner and from the age of sixteen began to study [[Anthroposophy]]. From the time he completed school and began his studies at the university, he was a member of the “Vienna Youth Group” of gifted, young people, predominantly from assimilated Jewish backgrounds, who came together to study Rudolf Steiner’s works. The focal point of this group became, after he arrived in Vienna, Dr [[Karl Koenig]], whose drive and idealism led them to agree to set up and work together in some common initiative.&lt;ref&gt;‘’The Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders’’ Edited by Friedwart Bock, Article by Christine Polyblank, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|0863154425}}, 9780863154423&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his PhD, Rudi took a position teaching in a school for the blind. On the day Hitler’s armies occupied Austria in 1938, Rudi Lissau, who, like most of the other members of the group, had laid his plans, left Austria for Britain. One of the few who did not go with them was his sister, who decided to throw in her lot with the Jewish people and did not survive the war. Rudi was the only one of the group that had made it to England who did not join with Dr Koenig in the founding of [[Camphill]], though he remained on terms of intimate friendship with all of them.

In London, Rudi began once again to work in a school for the blind until, like other enemy aliens, he was interned on the Isle of Man. His wife Hedda, also from Vienna, found him a post at the recently founded [[Wynstones School]] in Gloustershire and so obtained his release. He determined to make a success of this although he had never taught seeing children or applied the Steiner methods in his teaching – and he ended up staying for forty years. It was he that built up the high school at Wynstones and taught History, Geography, Latin, Greek, German and Music, being himself an accomplished pianist. He conducted hikes and ski tours with his students and encouraged their love of the countryside.

Though he greatly valued life in Britain, he never lost his love for his home in Austria or his gratitude for the outstanding classical education he had received in Vienna. He met and conferred with [[Viktor Frankl]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] who both made a deep impression on him and stimulated his profound interest for contemporary issues that were the basis of his extraordinary knowledge and ability to address such a variety of subjects in his teaching and lecturing. Vienna had also given him his background in classical music, his love for the mountains and the landscape that he imparted to his own daughters and the many children in his classes.

It was also in Vienna that he had schooled himself in the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, something that turned into a lifelong study and passion. It was this extensive knowledge and understanding of Steiner’s work that led him to his final engagement as the author of several books, a large number of articles and a sought-after lecturer on Anthroposophy all over Europe, North America and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=390 Rudi Lissau – Article by Marjatta van Boeschoten, Biographien Dokumentation der Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls retrieved 2014.09.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions

Notable definitions of software engineering include: 
* "the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software"—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—[[IEEE]] ''Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary''&lt;ref name="IEEE24765"&gt;''Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary'', [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

| isbn=0-321-31379-8 |pages=7 |chapter=1.1.2 What is software engineering?
| quote=Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. In this definition, there are two key phrases:&lt;br&gt; 1. ''Engineering discipline'' Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods and tools where these are appropriate [. . .] Engineers also recognize that they must work to organizational and financial constraints. [. . .]&lt;br&gt; 2. ''All aspects of software production'' Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development but also with activities such as software project management and with the development of tools, methods and theories to support software production.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines"—[[Friedrich L.

Bauer | title= Software Engineering | journal = Information Processing | volume = 71 | publisher = North-Holland Publishing Co.year = 1972 | pages = 530–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used less formally:
* as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called [[computer programming]] and [[systems analysis]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micsymposium.org/mics_2002/SALAH.PDF|publisher=35th Annual Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium|date=2002-04-05|accessdate=2006-09-13|author=Akram I. Salah|title=Engineering an Academic Program in Software Engineering}}: "For some, software engineering is just a glorified name for programming. If you are a programmer, you might put 'software engineer' on your business card—never 'programmer' though."&lt;/ref&gt;
* as the broad term for all aspects of the ''practice'' of computer programming, as opposed to the ''theory'' of computer programming, which is called [[computer science]];&lt;ref name="p. 26"&gt;Mills, Harlan D., J. R. Newman, and C. B.

The Computer Scientist is preparing for further theoretical studies..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* as the term embodying the ''advocacy'' of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an [[engineering]] discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evidence.cs.keele.ac.uk/rebse.html|title=Realizing Evidence-based Software Engineering|accessdate=2006-10-18|date=2004-12-14|author1=David Budgen|author2=Pearl Brereton|author3=Barbara Kitchenham|author4=Stephen Linkman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217013922/http://evidence.cs.keele.ac.uk/rebse.html|archivedate=2006-12-17|df=}}: "We believe that software engineering can only advance as an engineering discipline by moving away from its current dependence upon advocacy and analysis,...."&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first digital [[computer]]s appeared in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leondes |first= Cornelius T. |title= Intelligent Systems: Technology and Applications|year=2002| publisher=CRC Press| ISBN =978-0-8493-1121-5 | quote = 1.4 Computers and a First Glimpse at Al (1940s) | page = I-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the "stored program architecture" or [[von Neumann architecture]]. Thus the division between "hardware" and "software" began with [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] being used to deal with the complexity of computing.

[[Programming language]]s started to appear in the early 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell-Kelly |first1=Martin |title=The Development of Computer Programming in Britain (1945 to 1955) |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=April 1982 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–139 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1982.10016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was also another major step in abstraction. Major languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]], and [[COBOL]] were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively. [[David Parnas]] introduced the key concept of [[modularity]] and [[information hiding]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnas|first=David|authorlink=David Parnas|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1053–1058|url=http://www.acm.org/classics/may96/|title=On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules|date=December 1972|accessdate=2008-12-26|doi=10.1145/361598.361623}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help programmers deal with the ever-increasing complexity of [[software systems]].

The origins of the term "software engineering" have been attributed to various sources. The term "software engineering" appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of [http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/computersAndAutomation/196506.pdf COMPUTERS and AUTOMATION] and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) “letter to the ACM membership” by the ACM President Anthony A. Oettinger;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1984, the [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. [[Watts Humphrey]] founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process.  The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development(CMMI-DEV), which has defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.

Modern, generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by the [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7]] subcommittee and published as the [[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]] (SWEBOK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdisciplines ==
Software engineering can be divided into sub-disciplines.&lt;ref name="swebookv3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Version 3), 2014|url=https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3|website=www.swebok.org|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|accessdate=24 May 2016|ref=swebookv3|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are:
* [[Software requirements]]&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; (or [[Requirements engineering]]): The elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of [[requirements]] for [[software]].
* [[Software design]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. It is also defined as the result of that process.
* [[Software construction]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of [[Computer programming|programming]] (aka coding), verification, [[unit testing]], [[integration testing]], and [[debugging]].
* [[Software testing]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; An empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.
* [[Software maintenance]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The totality of activities required to provide cost-effective support to software.
* [[Software configuration management]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use [[software versioning]].
* [[Software engineering management]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified.
* [[Software development process]]:&lt;ref name="BoDu04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; The definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself.
* Software engineering models and methods&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable, and ultimately more success-oriented
* [[Software quality]]&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Software engineering professional practice&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; is concerned with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible, and ethical manner
* Software engineering economics&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt; is about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context
* Computing foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Mathematical foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;
* Engineering foundations&lt;ref name="swebookv3"/&gt;

== Education ==
Knowledge of [[computer programming]] is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004 the [[IEEE Computer Society]] produced the [[SWEBOK]], which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2004, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Abran |editor1-first= Alain | title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | location = Los Alamitos |year= 2005 | isbn = 0-7695-2330-7 | url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok |accessdate=2010-09-13|origyear= 2004|chapter= Chapter 1: Introduction to the Guide|chapter-url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/html/ch1 |quote= The total volume of cited literature is intended to be suitable for mastery through the completion of an undergraduate education plus four years of experience.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the [[Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula]] of the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], and updated in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/se2014.pdf |title=SE2014 Software Engineering Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, there were 244 Campus [[Bachelor of Software Engineering]] programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/software-engineering] Degree programs in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to interesting real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through [[military service]] in software engineering.

== Profession ==
{{Main|Software engineer|Software engineering professionalism}}

[[Legal]] requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer.  In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = N.S.W. | last = Williams | title = Professional Engineers Ontario's approach to licensing software engineering practitioners | booktitle = Software Engineering Education and Training, 2001 Proceedings. 14th Conference on | pages = 77–78 | publisher = [[IEEE]]| date = 19–21 February 2001 | location = Charlotte, NC | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the [[European Engineer]] (EUR ING) professional title.

The United States, since 2013, has offered an ''[[NCEES]]'' ''[[Professional Engineer]]'' exam for Software Engineering, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cdn1.ncees.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Exam-specifications_PE-Software-Apr-2013.pdf| title = NCEES Software Engineering Exam Specifications| accessdate = 2012-04-01| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130827220334/http://cdn1.ncees.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Exam-specifications_PE-Software-Apr-2013.pdf| archivedate = 2013-08-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NCEES will end the exam after April 2019 due to lack of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NCEES discontinuing PE Software Engineering exam |url=https://ncees.org/ncees-discontinuing-pe-software-engineering-exam/ |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |date=13 March 2018 |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial. In some parts of the US such as Texas, the use of the term [[Engineer]] is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a [[Professional Engineer]] license.

The [[IEEE Computer Society]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's ''Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge - 2004 Version'', or [[SWEBOK]], defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current SWEBOK v3 is an updated version and was released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3|title='SWEBOK Guide Version 3' |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEE also promulgates a "Software Engineering Code of Ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/Publications/code-of-ethics.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Software Engineering Code of Ethics'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===
The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] counted 1,256,200 software Developers (Engineers) holding jobs in the [[United States|U.S.]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 557,100 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet, the BLS also says some employment in these occupations are slowing and computer programmers is projected to decline 7 percent from 2016 to 2026 since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees and have no engineering background whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12|title=Software Engineering|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as [[freelancer]]s. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the [[software development process]]. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations include: in industry ([[Requirements analysis|analysts]], [[Software architecture|architects]], [[Software developer|developers]], [[Software testing|testers]], [[technical support]], [[middleware analyst]]s, [[Project management|managers]]) and in academia ([[educator]]s, [[researcher]]s).

Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Potential injuries in these occupations are possible because like other workers who spend long periods [[Sitting#Health_risks|sitting]] in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#training|title=Computer Software Engineers and Computer Programmers|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Certification ===
The [[Software Engineering Institute]] offers certifications on specific topics like [[IT security|security]], process improvement and [[software architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/certification/ |title=SEI certification page |publisher=Sei.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information Technology Architect Certification|IBM]], [[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft]] and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many [[Information technology|IT]] [[Professional certification (computer technology)|certification]] programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1180991|title=The Top 10 Problems with IT Certification in 2008|last=Wyrostek|first=Warren |date=March 14, 2008|work=InformIT|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. {{As of|2006}}, the [[IEEE]] had certified over 575 software professionals as a [[Certified Software Development Professional]] (CSDP).&lt;ref name="ieee2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.ifip.org/minutes/GA2006/Tab18b-US-IEEE.pdf|format=PDF|title=2006 IEEE computer society report to the IFIP General Assembly|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IEEE|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csda|title=CSDA|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] had a professional certification program in the early 1980s,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.&lt;ref name="acm2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf |title=A Summary of the ACM Position on Software Engineering as a Licensed Engineering Profession |last=ACM |date=July 17, 2000 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) |accessdate=2009-03-03 |quote=At its meeting in May 2000, the Council further concluded that the framework of a licensed professional engineer, originally developed for civil engineers, does not match the professional industrial practice of software engineering. Such licensing practices would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature; and would preclude many of the most qualified software engineers from becoming licensed. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517201804/http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. the [[British Computer Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Chartered IT Professional (CITP)'', available to fully qualified members (''MBCS''). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and so qualify for Chartered Engineer status. In Canada the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Information Systems Professional (ISP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Canadian Information Processing Society|url=http://www.cips.ca/standards/isp|title=I.S.P. Designation|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a ''Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)'' accredited program, successfully complete PEO's (''Professional Engineers Ontario'') Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the ''Professional Engineers Ontario'' and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.on.ca |title=Professional Engineers Ontario: Welcome to PEO's website |publisher=Peo.on.ca |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.

=== Impact of globalization ===
The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the [[developed world]] avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of [[offshore outsourcing]] (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by [[Foreign Worker Visa|foreign visa workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Patrick|last=Thibodaux|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2555175/it-careers/as-outsourcing-gathers-steam--computer-science-interest-wanes.html |title=As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes |publisher=Computerworld.com |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, [[computer programming]] does appear to have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook |title=Computer Programmers |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mullins |first=Robert |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html |title=Software developer growth slows in North America |publisher=InfoWorld |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404033214/http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the [[follow-the-sun]] workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cognizant.com/html/content/news/GartnerMQ_Cognizant.pdf |title=Gartner Magic Quadrant |publisher=Cognizant.com |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.

While global outsourcing has several advantages, global - and generally distributed - development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casey |first=Valentine |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13173-010-0013-3 |title=Virtual software team project management|publisher=Springer |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.

== Related fields ==
Software engineering is a direct sub-field of [[engineering]] and has an overlap with [[computer science]] and [[management science]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dagstuhl.de/Reports/96/9635.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also considered a part of overall [[systems engineering]].

=== Computer Science ===
{{stub section|date=July 2017}}

== Controversy ==

=== Criticism ===
Software engineering sees its practitioners as individuals who follow well-defined engineering approaches to problem-solving. These approaches are specified in various software engineering books and research papers, always with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism. This perspective has led to calls{{By whom|date=October 2018}} for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.

[[Software craftsmanship]] has been proposed by a body of software developers as an alternative that emphasizes the coding skills and accountability of the software developers themselves without professionalism or any prescribed curriculum leading to ad-hoc problem-solving (craftmanship) without engineering (lack of predictability, precision, missing risk mitigation, methods are informal and poorly defined). [http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/ The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto] extends the Agile Software Manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agilemanifesto.org/|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development |year=2001 |publisher=Agile Alliance|author=Beck, Kent |authorlink=Kent Beck|accessdate=14 June 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws a metaphor between modern software development and the apprenticeship model of medieval Europe.

Software engineering extends engineering and draws on the engineering model, i.e. engineering process, engineering project management, engineering requirements, engineering design, engineering construction, and engineering validation. The concept is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.

One of the core issues in software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a "theoretical environment."

[[Edsger Dijkstra]], the founder of many of the concepts used within software development today, rejected the idea of "software engineering" up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what
he called the "radical novelty" of [[computer science]]:

A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name "Software Engineering". As economics is known as "The Miserable Science", software engineering should be known as "The Doomed Discipline", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter "How to program if you cannot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html| title=On the cruelty of really teaching computing science| last = Dijkstra| first = E.

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

[[File:Malevich142.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Kazimir Malevich abstract painting ''Mower'' from 1930|''Mower'' by [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], 1930]]
During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

'''''Supra''''' (Latin for "above") is an [[academic]] and [[legal citation]] signal used when a writer desires to refer a reader to an earlier-cited authority. For example, an author wanting to refer to a source in his or her third footnote would cite: ''See '''supra''''' note 3.  Or for text in that note: ''See '''supra''''' text accompanying note 3.

Supra can also be used to provide a short form citation to an earlier (but not immediately preceding) authority. For example:
* 1. Stephen J. Legatzke, Note, The Equitable Recoupment Doctrine in United States v. Dalm: Where's the Equity, 10 Va. Tax Rev. 861 (1991).
* 2. Legatzke, ''supra'' note 1, at 862.
In this example, the second citation refers the reader to page 862 in the journal in which the article by Legatzke appears.
The use of supra should be done with care and only when the user fully understands its usage as it could be very confusing to readers if not used appropriately.

More generally, the phrase ''[[List_of_Latin_phrases_(V)#vide_supra|vide supra]]'' or ''v.s.'', often enclosed in parentheses, is used simply to refer the reader to preceding text.

'''Temporal lobe epilepsy''' ('''TLE''') is a [[chronic condition|chronic]] disorder of the [[nervous system]] characterized by recurrent, unprovoked [[focal seizure]]s that originate in the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[human brain|brain]] and last about one or two minutes. TLE is the most common form of [[epilepsy]] with [[focal seizure]]s.&lt;ref name="NINDS"&gt;{{cite|title=The Epilepsies and Seizures: Hope Through Research|date=1 February 2016|author=NINDS|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/epilepsy/detail_epilepsy.htm#3109_13|accessdate=8 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727233752/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/epilepsy/detail_epilepsy.htm#3109_13|archivedate=27 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A focal seizure in the temporal lobe may spread to other areas in the brain when it may become a ''focal to bilateral seizure''.

TLE is usually diagnosed in childhood or [[adolescence]]. TLE is diagnosed by taking a [[medical history]], [[blood test]]s, and [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]]. It can have a number of causes such as head injury, stroke, brain infections, structural lesions in the brain, or brain tumors, or it can be of ''unknown onset''. The first line of treatment is through [[anticonvulsant medication|anticonvulsants]]. Surgery may be an option, especially when there is an observable abnormality in the brain. Another treatment option is electrical stimulation of the brain through an implanted device called the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] (VNS).&lt;ref name="NINDS" /&gt;

== Types ==
Over forty types of epilepsy are recognized and these are divided into two main groups: [[focal seizure]]s and [[Generalized epilepsy|generalized seizures]].&lt;ref name="types"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Seizures|url=https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures|website=Epilepsy Foundation|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222162801/https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focal seizure]]s account for approximately sixty percent of all adult cases.&lt;ref name="Engel (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engel J | year = 2001 | title = A proposed diagnostic scheme for people with epileptic seizures and with epilepsy: report of the ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0013-9580&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=796 | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 796–803 | doi =  10.1046/j.1528-1157.2001.10401.x| pmid = 11422340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the single most common form of focal seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10830320 | volume=27 Suppl 1 | title=Epidemiology of temporal lobe epilepsy | date=May 2000 | author=Wiebe S | journal=Can J Neurol Sci | pages=S6–10; discussion S20–1 | doi=10.1017/s0317167100000561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International League Against Epilepsy]] (ILAE) recognizes two main types of temporal lobe epilepsy: mesial&lt;!--not a misspelling--&gt; temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), arising in the [[hippocampus]], the [[parahippocampal gyrus]] and the [[amygdala]] which are located in the inner ([[Lateral and medial|medial]]) aspect of the temporal lobe and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE), the rarer type, arising in the [[neocortex]] at the outer ([[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]]) surface of the temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Engel (2001)"/&gt; The seizures of LTLE are characterized by auditory or visual features. [[Autosomal dominant]] lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTLE) is a rare hereditary condition, often associated with mutations in the [[LGI1]] gene.&lt;ref name="Nobile"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nobile|first1=C|last2=Michelucci|first2=R|last3=Andreazza|first3=S|last4=Pasini|first4=E|last5=Tosatto|first5=SC|last6=Striano|first6=P|title=LGI1 mutations in autosomal dominant and sporadic lateral temporal epilepsy.|journal=Human Mutation|date=April 2009|volume=30|issue=4|pages=530–6|doi=10.1002/humu.20925|pmid=19191227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
When a seizure begins in the temporal lobe, its effects depend on the precise location of its point of origin, its ''locus''. In 1981, the ILAE recognized three types of seizures occurring in temporal lobe epilepsy. The classification was based on [[electroencephalogram|EEG]] findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = ILAE | year = 1981 | title = Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 489–501 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1981.tb06159.x | pmid=6790275}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as of 2017 the general classification of seizures has been revised.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Revised Classification of Seizures|url=https://www.epilepsy.com/article/2016/12/2017-revised-classification-seizures|website=Epilepsy Foundation|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222162826/https://www.epilepsy.com/article/2016/12/2017-revised-classification-seizures|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newer classification uses three key features: where the seizures begin, the level of awareness during a seizure, and other features.&lt;ref name="revision"/&gt;

=== Focal seizures  ===
[[File:MRI Location Amygdala up.png|thumb|MRI Location amygdala]]
[[Focal seizure]]s in the temporal lobe involve small areas of the lobe such as the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]].

The newer classification gives two types of ''focal onset seizures'', as ''focal aware'' and  ''focal impaired awareness''.&lt;ref name="types"/&gt;

====Focal aware seizures====
''Focal aware'' means that the level of consciousness is not altered during the seizure.&lt;ref name="types"/&gt; In temporal lobe epilepsy, a focal seizure usually causes abnormal sensations only.

These may be:
* Sensations such as [[déjà vu]] (a feeling of familiarity), [[jamais vu]] (a feeling of unfamiliarity)
* [[Amnesia]]; or a single memory or set of memories
* A sudden sense of unprovoked fear and anxiety
* Nausea
* Auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile [[hallucination]]s. 
* Visual distortions such as [[macropsia]] and [[micropsia]]
* [[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]] or [[Derealization|derealisation]] 
* [[Synesthesia]] (stimulation of one sense experienced in a second sense) may transpire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synesthetic associations and psychosensory symptoms of temporal epilepsy |author1=Marcel Neckar |author2=Petr Bob |date=11 January 2016 |work= Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |pmc=4714732 |pmid=26811683 |doi=10.2147/NDT.S95464 |volume=12 |pages=109–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Dysphoric or euphoric feelings, fear, anger, and other emotions may also occur. Often, the patient cannot describe the sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hallucinations|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Knopf|year=2012|isbn=0307957241|location=|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Olfactory hallucinations often seem indescribable to patients beyond "pleasant" or "unpleasant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hallucinations|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Knopf|year=2012|isbn=9780307957245|location=|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focal aware seizures are often called "[[aura (symptom)|aura]]s" when they serve as a warning sign of a subsequent seizure. Regardless an ''aura'' is actually a seizure itself, and such a focal seizure may or may not progress to a focal impaired awareness seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/epilepsy/seizures/types/simple-partial-seizures.html "Simple partial seizures."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203163318/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/epilepsy/seizures/types/simple-partial-seizures.html |date=3 February 2014 }} Johns Hopkins Medicine website. Accessed 2 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; People who only experience focal aware seizures may not recognize what they are, nor seek medical care.

====Focal impaired awareness seizures====
Focal impaired awareness seizures are seizures which impair consciousness to some extent:&lt;ref name="types"/&gt; they alter the person's ability to interact normally with their environment. They usually begin with a focal aware seizure, then spread to a larger portion of the temporal lobe, resulting in impaired consciousness. They may include autonomic and psychic features present in focal aware seizures.

Signs may include:&lt;ref name="Mayo (2014)"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/temporal-lobe-seizure/basics/definition/con-20022892 "Temporal lobe epilepsy."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523111044/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/temporal-lobe-seizure/basics/definition/con-20022892 |date=23 May 2016 }} Mayo Clinic patient information website. Accessed 2 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Motionless staring 
* Automatic movements of the hands or mouth
* Confusion and disorientation
* Altered ability to respond to others, unusual speech
* Transient [[aphasia]] (losing ability to speak, read, or comprehend spoken word)
These seizures tend to have a warning or aura before they occur, and when they occur they generally tend to last only 1–2 minutes. It is not uncommon for an individual to be tired or confused for up to 15 minutes after a seizure has occurred, although postictal confusion can last for hours or even days. Though they may not seem harmful, due to the fact that the individual does not normally seize, they can be extremely harmful if the individual is left alone around dangerous objects. For example, if a person with complex partial seizures is driving alone, this can cause them to run into the ditch, or worse, cause an accident involving multiple people. With this type, some people do not even realize they are having a seizure and most of the time their memory from right before or after the seizure is wiped. First-aid is only required if there has been an injury or if this is the first time a person has had a seizure.

====Focal to bilateral seizures====
Seizures which begin in the temporal lobe, and then spread to involve both sides of the brain are termed ''focal to bilateral''. (Where both sides of the brain or the whole brain are involved from the onset the seizures are known as [[generalized seizure]]s and may be [[tonic-clonic seizure|tonic clonic]].&lt;ref name ="revision"/&gt; The arms, trunk, and legs stiffen (the tonic phase), in either a flexed or extended position, and then jerk (the clonic phase). These were previously known as ''grand mal'' seizures.&lt;ref name="Mayo (2014)"/&gt; The word ''grand mal'' comes from the [[French language|French]] term, meaning ''major affliction.''{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Postictal period ===
There is some period of recovery in which neurological function is altered after each of these seizure types. This is the ''[[postictal state]]''. The degree and length of postictal impairment directly correlates with the severity of the seizure type. Focal aware seizures often last less than sixty seconds; focal with impaired awareness seizures may last up to two minutes; and generalized tonic clonic seizures may last up to three minutes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The postictal state in seizures other than ''focal aware'' may last much longer than the seizure itself.

Because a major function of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, a focal with impaired awareness seizure, and a focal to bilateral seizure can cause amnesia for the period of the seizure, meaning that the seizure may not be remembered.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Complications and prognosis ==

=== Depression ===
Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy have a higher prevalence of depression than the general population. Although the psychosocial impacts of epilepsy may be causative, there are also links in the [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] and [[neuroscience|neurobiology]] of TLE and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Cortical thickness abnormalities associated with depressive symptoms in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=Epilepsy Behav|volume=23|issue=1|pages=64–67|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2011.10.001|pmc=3259282|pmid=22099527|vauthors=Butler T, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
[[File:Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]
The temporal lobe and particularly the [[hippocampus#role in memory|hippocampus]] plays an important role in memory processing. [[Declarative memory]] (memories which can be consciously recalled) is formed in the area of the hippocampus called the ''[[dentate gyrus]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with memory disorders and loss of memory. [[Scientific modelling|Animal models]] and clinical studies show that memory loss correlates with temporal lobe [[neuron]]al loss in temporal lobe epilepsy. [[Verbal memory]] deficit correlates with [[pyramidal cell]] loss in TLE. This is more so on the left in verbal memory loss. Neuronal loss on the right is more prominent in non-verbal ([[Spatial memory|visuospatial memory]] loss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=Repeated brief seizures induce progressive hippocampal neuron loss and memory deficits|url=|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=135|issue=|pages=95–110|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(02)35010-6|pmid=12143373|vauthors=Sutula T, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|title=Specificity in the correlation of verbal memory and hippocampal neuron loss: dissociation of memory, language, and verbal intellectual ability|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical &amp; Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=14|issue=5|pages=662–672|doi=10.1080/01688639208402854|pmid=1474137|author=Sass K.

L.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Childhood onset ===
After childhood onset, one third will "grow out" of TLE, finding a lasting remission up to an average of 20 years. The finding of a lesion such as [[hippocampal sclerosis]] (a scar in the hippocampus), tumour, or [[dysplasia]], on [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) predicts the intractability of seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=New-onset temporal lobe epilepsy in children: lesion on MRI predicts poor seizure outcome|url=|journal=Neurology|volume=67|issue=12|pages=2147–2153|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000248189.93630.4f|pmid=17082466|author=Spooner C. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
{{main|Geschwind syndrome}}
The effect of temporal lobe epilepsy on personality is an historical observation dating to the 1800s. Personality and behavioural change in temporal lobe epilepsy is seen as a chronic condition when it persists for more than three months.&lt;ref&gt;Geschwind N. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=9&amp;hid=111&amp;sid=c8086c06-34b1-49d7-8ec0-76937b381df3%40sessionmgr112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2009-12026-006] Registration required to view.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geschwind syndrome]] is a set of behavioural phenomena seen in some people with TLE. Documented by [[Norman Geschwind]], signs include: [[hypergraphia]] (compulsion to write (or draw) excessively), [[hyperreligiosity]] (intense religious or philosophical experiences or interests), [[asexuality|hyposexuality]] (reduced sexual interest or drive), [[circumstantial speech|circumstantiality]] (result of a non-linear thought pattern, talks at length about irrelevant and trivial details).&lt;ref name="David" /&gt; The personality changes generally vary by hemisphere.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohG6I1C_NeAC&amp;pg=PA347|title=Lishman's Organic Psychiatry: A Textbook of Neuropsychiatry|vauthors=Mellers J|veditors=David A, David AS, Fleminger S, Kopelman M, Lovestone S, Mellers J|location=West Sussex, UK|chapter=6 Epilepsy|pages=347–348|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|ISBN=9780470675076|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a "temporal lobe epileptic personality" and Geschwind syndrome has been disputed and research is inconclusive.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[file:Spike-waves.png|thumb|Epileptic spike and wave discharges monitored with EEG]]
The diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy can include the following methods:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1184509-workup#showall|title=Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Workup: Approach Considerations, Computed Tomography Scanning, Magnetic Resonance Imaging|website=emedicine.medscape.com|access-date=2016-08-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823210306/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1184509-workup#showall|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[CT scan]]s, [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[electroencephalography|EEG]], and [[magnetoencephalography]].

===Differential diagnosis===
Other medical conditions with similar symptoms include [[panic attacks]], [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychosis spectrum disorders]], [[tardive dyskinesia]], and [[occipital lobe]] epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patient.info/doctor/temporal-lobe-epilepsy|title=Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; TLE medical Information Page {{!}} Patient|website=Patient|accessdate=24 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829193229/http://patient.info/doctor/temporal-lobe-epilepsy|archivedate=29 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of TLE include [[mesial temporal sclerosis]], [[traumatic brain injury]], brain infections, such as [[encephalitis]] and [[meningitis]], [[Cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic brain injury]], stroke, cerebral tumours, and genetic syndromes. Temporal lobe epilepsy is not the result of psychiatric illness or fragility of the personality.&lt;ref name="Mayo (2014)" /&gt;

=== Febrile seizures ===
Although the theory is controversial, there is a link between [[febrile seizure]]s (seizures coinciding with episodes of fever in young children) and subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy, at least [[epidemiology|epidemiologically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shinnar S, etal | year = 2008 | title = Phenomenology of prolonged febrile seizures: results of the FEBSTAT study | url = http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18525033 | journal = Neurology | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 170–176 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000310774.01185.97 | pmid = 18525033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarkka R, etal | year = 2003 | title = Febrile seizures and mesial temporal sclerosis: no association in a long-term follow-up study | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 215–218 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000037482.55894.B1 | pmid = 12552033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berg A.

=== Human herpes virus 6 ===
[[File:2DDU.png|thumb|150 px|Reelin]]
In the mid 1980s, [[human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV-6) was suggested as a possible causal link between febrile convulsions and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, although the virus is found in temporal lobe tissue at surgery for TLE, it has not been recognised as a major factor in febrile seizures or TLE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-510X(07)00570-9 | pmid=17804017 | doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.08.010 | volume=264 | title=Investigation of HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, HHV-6 and HHV-8 DNA by real-time PCR in surgical resection materials of epilepsy patients with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis | date=January 2008 | vauthors=Karatas H, Gurer G, Pinar A, etal | journal=J.

=== Reelin ===
Dispersion of the granule cell layer in the hippocampal [[dentate gyrus]] is occasionally seen in temporal lobe epilepsy and has been linked to the downregulation of [[reelin]], a protein that normally keeps the layer compact by containing [[neuronal migration]]. It is unknown whether changes in reelin expression play a role in epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haas C. A.| year = 2002 | title = Role for reelin in the development of granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = J.

== Pathophysiology ==

=== Neuronal loss ===
In TLE, there is loss of neurons in region [[Region I of hippocampus proper|CA1]] and [[Region III of hippocampus proper|CA3]] of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name="Jasper (2012)"&gt;de Lanerolle N.

=== Granule cell dispersion in the dentate gyrus ===
Granule cell dispersion is a type of developmental migration and a pathological change found in the TLE brain which was first described in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thom M, etal | year = 2005 | title = Cell proliferation and granule cell dispersion in human hippocampal sclerosis | url = | journal = J Neuropathol Exp Neurol | volume = 64 | issue = 3| pages = 194–201 | pmid = 15804050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houser (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Houser C. R. | year = 1990 | title = Granule cell dispersion in the dentate gyrus of humans with temporal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 535 | issue = 2| pages = 195–204 | pmid = 1705855 | doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)91601-c}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granule cells of the [[dentate gyrus]] are tightly packed forming a uniform, laminated layer with no [[synapse|monosynaptic]] connections.&lt;ref name="Nadler (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nadler J. V. | year = 2003 | title = The recurrent mossy fiber pathway of the epileptic brain | url = | journal = Neurochemical Research | volume = 28 | issue = 11| pages = 1649–1658 | pmid = 14584819 | doi=10.1023/a:1026004904199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure provides a filter for the excitability of neurons.&lt;ref name="Nadler (2003)" /&gt;

In TLE, granule cells are lost, the structure is no longer closely packed and there are changes in the orientation of [[dendrite]]s.&lt;ref name="Houser (1990)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freimanr T.

For instance, if the dendrites of granule cells reconnect, it may be in a way (through the laminar planes) that allows hyperexcitability.&lt;ref name="Sloviter R. S p73-76" /&gt; However, not all patients have granule cell dispersion.&lt;ref name="Jasper (2012)" /&gt;{{rp|page=387–389}}

=== Aberrant mossy fiber sprouting ===
[[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|Mossy fibers]] are the [[axon]]s of [[granule cell]]s. They project into the hilus of the dentate gyrus and [[stratum lucidum]] in the CA3 region giving inputs to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.&lt;ref name="Nadler (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim C, etal | year = 1997 | title = Connections of the hippocampal formation in humans: I. The mossy fiber pathway | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 385 | issue = 3| pages = 325–351 | pmid = 9300763 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(19970901)385:3&lt;325::aid-cne1&gt;3.0.co;2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Henze D.

In the TLE brain, where granule cells are damaged or lost, axons, the ''mossy'' fibres, 'sprout' in order to reconnect to other granule cell dendrites. This is an example of ''synaptic reorganization''. This was noted in human tissue in 1974 and in animal models in 1985. In TLE, the sprouting mossy fibres are larger than in the normal brain and their connections may be aberrant. Mossy fibre sprouting continues from one week to two months after injury.&lt;ref name="Jasper (2012)" /&gt;{{rp|page=416–431}}&lt;ref name="Nadler (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheibel P, etal | year = 1974 | title = The hippocampal-dentate complex in temporal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 55–80 | pmid = 4523024 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1974.tb03997.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1284974| doi = 10.1002/hipo.450020305 | volume=2 | title=Lesion-induced synapse reorganization in the hippocampus of cats: sprouting of entorhinal, commissural/associational, and mossy fiber projections after unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions, with comments on the normal organization of these pathways | year=1992 | author=Steward O | journal=Hippocampus | pages=247–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Babb T.

Aberrant mossy fibre sprouting may create excitatory feedback circuits that lead to temporal lobe seizures. This is evident in intracellular recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckmaster P, etal | year = 2002 | title = Axon sprouting in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy creates a predominantly excitatory feedback circuit | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 22 | issue = 15| pages = 6650–6658 | pmid = 12151544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulation of aberrant mossy fibre areas increases the [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nadler J. V.| year = 1985 | title = Evidence of functional mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampal formation of kainic acid-treated rats | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 1016–1022 | pmid = 3981241 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scharfman H.

However, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting may inhibit excitatory transmission by synapsing with basket cells which are inhibitory neurons and by releasing [[GABA]] and [[neuropeptide Y]] which are [[neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|inhibitory neurotransmitter]]s. Also, in animal models, granule cell hyper-excitability is recorded before aberrant mossy fibre sprouting has occurred.&lt;ref name="Sloviter (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sloviter R.

== Treatments ==

=== Anticonvulsants ===
Many [[anticonvulsant]] oral medications are available for the management of temporal lobe seizures. Most anticonvulsants function by decreasing the excitation of [[neurons]], for example, by blocking fast or slow [[sodium channels]] or by modulating [[calcium channels]]; or by enhancing the inhibition of neurons, for example by potentiating the effects of inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]] like [[GABA]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In TLE, the most commonly used older [[anticonvulsant|medications]] are [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], [[primidone]], [[valproate]], and [[phenobarbital]]. Newer drugs, such as [[gabapentin]], [[topiramate]], [[levetiracetam]], [[lamotrigine]], [[pregabalin]], [[tiagabine]], [[lacosamide]], and [[zonisamide]] promise similar effectiveness, with possibly fewer [[adverse effect|side-effects]]. [[Felbamate]] and [[vigabatrin]] are newer, but can have serious adverse effects so they are not considered as first-line treatments.

Up to one third of patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy will not have adequate seizure control with medication alone. For patients with medial TLE whose seizures remain uncontrolled after trials of several types of anticonvulsants (that is, the epilepsy is ''intractable''), surgical excision of the affected temporal lobe may be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kwan P | year = 2000 | title = Early identification of refractory epilepsy | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 342 | issue = 5| pages = 314–319 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200002033420503 | pmid = 10660394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surgical interventions ===
Epilepsy surgery has been performed since the 1860s and doctors have observed that it is highly effective in producing freedom from seizures. However, it was not until 2001 that a scientifically sound study was carried out to examine the effectiveness of temporal lobectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wiebe S, etal | year = 2001 | title = A randomized, controlled trial of surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 345 | issue = 5| pages = 311–318 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200108023450501 | pmid = 11484687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporal lobe surgery can be complicated by decreased [[cognitive function]]. However, after temporal lobectomy, memory function is supported by the [[contralateral|opposite]] temporal lobe; and recruitment of the frontal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheung| year = 2009 | title = Pre- and postoperative fMRI and clinical memory performance in temporal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | volume = 80 | issue = 10| pages = 1099–1106 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2009.173161 | pmid = 19389718 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maccotta L, etal | year = 2007 | title = Changing frontal contributions to memory before and after medial temporal lobectomy | url = | journal = Cereb Cortex | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 443–456 | pmid = 16547345 | doi=10.1093/cercor/bhj161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|Cognitive rehabilitation]] may also help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Helmstaedter C, etal | year = 2008 | title = The effects of cognitive rehabilitation on memory outcome after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery | url = | journal = Epilepsy Behav | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 402–409 | pmid = 18155965 | doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2007.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other treatments===
Where surgery is not recommended, further management options include new (including experimental) [[anticonvulsant]]s, and [[vagus nerve stimulation]]. The [[ketogenic diet]] is also recommended for children, and some adults.&lt;ref name="JMF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JM|last2=Kossoff|first2=EH|last3=Hartman|first3=AL|title=The ketogenic diet: one decade later.|journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2007|volume=119|issue=3|pages=535–43|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2447|pmid=17332207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other options include brain cortex responsive neural stimulators, [[deep brain stimulation]], [[Stereotactic surgery#Stereotactic radio surgery|stereotactic radiosurgery]], such as the [[gamma knife]], and [[laser ablation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epilepsybehavior.com/article/S1525-5050(12)00362-9/abstract?cc=y=&lt;/ref&gt;

== Link with religiosity ==

The first to record and catalog the abnormal symptoms and signs of TLE was [[Norman Geschwind]]. He found a constellation of symptoms that included [[hypergraphia]], [[hyperreligiosity]], [[Syncope (medicine)|collapse]], and [[pedantic|pedantism]], now called ''[[Geschwind syndrome]]''.

[[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using the [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), which correlates with emotional arousal, to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli. Ramachandran presented two subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR. Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. This study was presented as an abstract at a neuroscience conference and referenced in Ramachandran's book, ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ramachandran, V. and Blakeslee | year=1998 | title=[[Phantoms in the Brain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has never been published in the [[peer-review]]ed scientific press.&lt;ref name="AaenStockdale2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Psychologist | author=Craig Aaen-Stockdale | title=Neuroscience for the Soul | url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-7/neuroscience-soul | year=2012 | volume=25 | issue=7 | pages=520–523 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026234117/http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-7/neuroscience-soul | archivedate=26 October 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporal lobe epilepsy has been suggested as a physical explanation for the [[revelation|revelatory experiences]] of prominent religious figures such as [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], Jesus, [[Mohammed]], [[Saint Paul]], and [[Joseph Smith]]. These experiences are described as complex interactions with their visions, but lacking the stereotypy, amnestic periods, and automatisms or generalized motor events, which are characteristic of TLE. Psychiatric conditions with [[psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] symptoms may be a more plausible physical explanation of these experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25256">The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' ('''TO''')   describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Augusto Boal]] first elaborated in the 1970s, initially in [[Brazil]] and later in [[Europe]]. Boal was influenced by the work of the educator and theorist [[Paulo Freire]]. Boal's techniques use theatre as means of promoting social and political change in alignment originally with [[Far-left politics|radical left]] politics and later with [[center left]] ideology. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the audience becomes active, such that as "spect-actors" they explore, show, analyse and transform the reality in which they are living.

==History==
The Theatre of the Oppressed, a term coined by Augusto Boal, is a series of theatrical analyses and critiques developed in the 1950s. Boal was an avid supporter of utilizing interactive techniques, especially in the context of theatre. Many of his ideas are considered as "a new media perspective", despite the relatively early birth of these ideas. Since then, these ideas have been developed more, giving them meaning in a modern-day context. The creation of the Theatre of the Oppressed is largely based on the idea of dialogue and interaction between audience and performer. Moreover, these ideas have served as a framework for the development and evolution of stronger ideas.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Terminology==

===Joker/facilitator/difficultator===
Much of [[Augusto Boal]]'s theatrical process requires a neutral party to be at the centre of proceedings. This individual is usually called the "facilitator". In Boal's literature this role is referred to as the "joker", in reference to the neutrality of the [[Joker (playing card)|Joker card]] in a deck of playing cards.

This person takes responsibility for the logistics of the process and ensures a fair proceeding, but must never comment upon or intervene in the content of the performance, as that is the province of the "spect-actors". Fairness in this context means making sure that the problem story, which by its nature involves a situation of oppression that must be overcome, is not solved—that is, that the participants (the "{{not a typo|spectactors}}") focus on solving the problem in as realistic and plausible a way as possible, even though it is being played out in a fictional theatrical piece. The result should be something like group "brainstorming" about social problems within the community.

===Spect-actor===
This is a term created by Augusto Boal to describe those engaged in Forum theatre. It refers to the dual role of those involved in the process as both spectator and actor, as they both observe and create dramatic meaning and action in any performance.

Equally, the term "spect-actor" can be attributed to the participants in invisible theatre (who are unaware that they are part of a theatrical production, but nevertheless contribute to the discussion) and image theatre (who, upon viewing the image created, may alter it to reflect their own ideas).

Boal emphasizes the critical need to prevent the isolation of the audience. The term "spectator" brands the participants as less than human; hence, it's necessary to humanize them, to restore to them their capacity for action in all its fullness. They must also be a subject, an actor on equal plane with those accepted as actors, who in turn must also be spectators. This will eliminate any notions of the ruling class and the theatre solely portraying their ideals while the audience members are the passive victims of those images. This way the spectators no longer delegate power to the characters either to think or act in their place. They free themselves; they think and act for themselves. Boal supports the idea that theatre is not revolutionary in itself but is rehearsal of revolution. (Wardrip-Fruin, 352)&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort. "From Theatre of the Oppressed." The NewMediaReader. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}, p. 339-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major branches==

During the development of Theatre of the Oppressed, Boal worked with many populations and tried many techniques. These techniques eventually coalesced into different theatrical styles, each using a different process to achieve a different result. Boal often organized these theatrical systems as a tree, with images, sounds and words as the roots, games, Image Theatre and Forum Theatre ascending up the trunk, and then other techniques represented as limbs stemming from these.&lt;ref name="TO Tree"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theatre of the Oppressed?|url=http://theforumproject.org/whatisto/|work=Tree of the Theatre of the Oppressed|publisher=The Forum Project|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more T.O. systems evolved, Boal and others have made slight modifications to which techniques appear on various limbs, but the Tree of Theatre of the Oppressed has mostly remained consistent:

===Image theatre===
{{main article|Image theatre}}
Image theatre is a performance technique in which one person, acting as a sculptor, moulds one or more people acting as statues, using only touch and resisting the use of words or mirror-image modelling. Boal claims this form of theatre to be one of the most stimulating because of its ease of enactment and its remarkable capacity of portraying thought in a concrete form due to the absence of language idiom. Each word has a denotation common for all as well as a connotation that is unique for each individual. Each will have his own interpretation of "revolution", and to demonstrate such idea provides a clearer understanding of their intention in definition when shown rather than told. (Wardrip-Fruin, 344). For instance, one can "embrace" another in many ways (in a tight, harassing manner or a loose soft manner), however the word has the same definition of clasping another person in the arms.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Forum theatre===
{{main article|Forum theatre}}
[[File:Theatre of the Oppressed1.jpg|thumb|300px| Participants in a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
While practicing in South America earlier in his career, Boal would apply 'simultaneous [[dramaturgy]]'. In this process, the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way (for example, a typically [[chauvinist]] man mistreating a woman or a factory owner mistreating an employee). In early forms of 'simultaneous dramaturgy', the audience could propose any solution, by calling out suggestions to the actors who would improvise the changes on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, Boal (1993). Theater of the Oppressed p. 132-133. New York: Theatre Communications Group. {{ISBN|0-930452-49-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to undo the traditional audience/actor partition and bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching.

Forum Theatre was essentially born from 'simultaneous dramaturgy.' The concept of the 'spect-actor' became a dominant force within and shaped Boal's theater work, gradually helping it shift into what he called Forum Theatre (due to the acting's taking on the character of a public discussion or series of proposals, only in dramatic format). The audience were now encouraged to not only imagine change but to actually practise that change, by coming on stage as 'spect-actors' to replace the protagonist and act out an intervention to "break the oppression." Through this process, the participant is also able to realize and experience the challenges of achieving the improvements he/she suggested (Wardrip-Fruin, 344).&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt; The actors who welcome the spectactor volunteering onto the stage play against the spectactor's attempts to intervene and change the story, offering a strong resistance so that the difficulties in making any change are also acknowledged.

[[File:Augusto Boal nyc2.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Augusto Boal''' presenting a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
Thus, Boal's current manifestation of Forum theatre is as follows: the actors (either professional actors or non professionals drawn from oppressed communities) perform a play with a scripted core, in which an oppression relevant to the audience is played out. After reaching the scripted conclusion, in which the oppressed character(s) fail to overturn their oppression, the actors begin the production again, although often in a condensed form. At any point during this ''second'' performance, any spect-actor may call out "stop!" and take the place of the actor portraying the ''oppressed'' individual (this actor stays on stage but to the side, giving suggestions to the spect-actor who has replaced him/her).

If and when the oppression has been overthrown by the spect-actors, the production changes again: the spect-actors now have the opportunity to replace the ''oppressors'', and find new ways of challenging the oppressed character. In this way a more realistic depiction of the oppression can be made by the audience, who are often victims of the oppression. The whole process is designed to be [[dialectic]], coming to a conclusion through the consideration of opposing arguments, rather than [[Didacticism|didactic]], in which the moral argument is one-sided and pushed from the actors with no chance of reply or counter-argument.

Boal clarifies that this practice is not intended to show the correct path, but rather to discover all possible paths which may be further examined. The theatre itself is not revolutionary; but it offers a chance to rehearse for revolution. The spectators learn much from the enactment even though the acting is fiction, because the fiction simulates real-life situations, problems, and solutions. It stimulates the practice of resistance to oppression in reality, and offers a "safe space" for practicing making change. When faced in reality with a similar situation they've rehearsed in theatre, participants who have experienced Forum Theatre ideally will desire to be proactive, and will have the courage to break oppressive situations in real life, since they feel much more prepared and confident in resolving the conflict. Another way of thinking about it is that rehearsing the actions helps spectactors to develop their own courage and makes them desire action for change in real life. The practice of this form creates an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks fulfillment through real action. (Wardrip-Fruin, 346) &lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Invisible theatre===
{{main article|Invisible theatre}}
Invisible theatre is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one—for example in the street or in a shopping centre. The performers attempt to disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, encouraging the spectators (or rather, unknowing spect-actors) to view it as a real event. The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal &amp; Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during Boal's time in Argentina in the 1970s as part of his Theater of the Oppressed work, which focused on oppression and social issues.

===Newspaper theatre===
A system of techniques devised to give the audience a way to transform daily news articles or any non-dramatic pieces to theatrical scene. The strategies are as follows (Wardrip-Fruin, 346):&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

* ''Simple Reading'': news item read, detached from the context of the newspaper (which makes it false or controversial).
* ''Crossed Reading'': two news item are read in alternating form, complementing or contrasting each other in a new dimension.
* ''Complementary Reading'': information generally omitted by the ruling class are added to the news.
* ''Rhythmical Reading'': article is read to a rhythm (musical), so it acts as a critical "filter" of the news, revealing the true content initially concealed in the newspaper.
* ''Parallel Action'': actors mimic the actions as the news is being read. One hears the news and watches its visual complement.
* ''Improvisation'': news is improvised on stage to exploit all its variants and possibilities.
* ''Historical'': data recurred from historical moments, events in other countries, or in social systems are added to the news.
* ''Reinforcement'': article is read accompanied by songs, slides, or publicity materials.
* ''Concretion of the Abstract'': abstract content in news is made concrete on stage, i.e. hunger, unemployment, etc.
* ''Text out of Context'': news is presented out of context in which it was originally published.

===Rainbow of Desire===
'''Rainbow of Desire''' is a technique and also a family of techniques explained by Boal in his book of the same name. Rainbow techniques stem from Image theatre and tend to focus on forms of internalized oppression played out by a [[protagonist]] in relation to an [[antagonist]]. While in his earlier work Boal eschewed the use of Theatre of the Oppressed as "[[drama therapy]]", he later began to espouse these more introspective techniques as a form of "theatre and therapy."&lt;ref name=ROD&gt;{{cite book|last=Boal|first=Augusto|title=The Rainbow of Desire : the Boal method of theatre and therapy|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-10349-5|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative theatre===
When Boal was a ''Vereador'' ([[Alderman|city councilman]]) in Rio de Janeiro, he created a new form of theatre called "legislative theatre" to give his voters the opportunity to voice their opinions. The objective is to open up a dialogue between citizens and institutional entities so that there is a flow of power between both groups. Boal calls this type of legislative process a "transitive democracy," which lies in between direct democracy (practiced in ancient Greece) and delegate democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://ospiti.peacelink.it/giolli/giolli_gb/node5.html#SECTION02360000000000000000&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to forum theatre; however, the subject of the production is based on a proposed law to be passed. Spect-actors may take the stage and express their opinions, thereby helping with the creation of new laws. Some 13 laws were created through legislative theatre during Boal's time in government. The technique has since been used overseas in countries including [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Other techniques==

===Analytical theatre===
A story is told by one of the participants and immediately the actors improvise it. Afterward each character is broken down into their social roles and the participants are asked to choose a physical object to symbolize each role. For instance for one community the symbol for the head of the family may be a piggy bank, since that individual is the one who controls the finances (power). Having analyzed the characters, a fresh attempt to tell the story is made, however this time removing some of the symbols from each character, and consequently some social roles as well. For example, the story would be perceived differently if the robber had the police uniform and the hostage possessed a revolver. Through this method, the participants will realize that human actions are not the exclusive and primitive result of human psychology; the individual speaks of their class as well. (Wardrip-Fruin, 351)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Breaking repression===
Boal explains that the technique of breaking repression involves asking the participant to remember a particular moment when he or she felt especially repressed, accepted it, and submitted to act in a manner contrary to his or her own desires. It is necessary, he explains, that the choice is a particular incident rather than a general sense of oppression. The participant describes that incident, which is then reconstructed and re-enacted with other participants of his choosing. This performance is repeated, except that this time the repressed is asked to fight to impose his or her will while the others involved are invited to maintain the repression.

The conflict that results helps to measure the possibility one has to resist in situations where one  fails to do so, as well as to measure the true strength of the enemy. Having rehearsed a resistance to oppression prepares the individual to resist effectively in similar situations that may be encountered in the future.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

Boal states that the process to be realized in doing this type of theater is the one that ascends from the phenomenon toward the law; from the phenomena presented in the plot toward the social laws that govern those phenomena.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Photo-romance&lt;!--'Photo-romance' and 'Photoromance' redirect here--&gt;===
{{main|Photo comics}}
'''Photo-romance'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a romantic narrative illustrated with sequential photographs in the style of a comic strip, usually published in magazines and such. The technique involves introducing to the participants the general plot without revealing the source of the photo-romance. Then, the participants are asked to act out the story, which is then compared to the actual story as described in the source. The differences are discussed thereafter.

A particular story interpreted and acted out may be a predictable, pathetic one, however at the same time this result serves as a magnificent example of ideological insight. Boal argues that if they first act out the story themselves then afterwords read the original version, the participants will no longer assume a passive, expectant attitude, but instead a critical, comparative one. They will also be prepared to detect the poison infiltrating the pages of those photo-stories, or the comics and other forms of cultural and ideological domination. This technique is also useful to analyze television programs, a dominant source of poison directed against the people. (Wardrip-Fruin, 349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Rituals and masks===
This technique attempts to reveal the [[Ideology|ideological]] [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of a society in the form of its rituals. "Rituals" in this sense describes the patterns of human relationships and the masks of behaviour that those patterns impose on the participants according to the roles that they play in society. For example: a man goes to a priest to confess his sins; despite the individual identities of the man and priest (i.e. the priest and the parishioner are landlords, the priest is a landlord and the parishioner is a peasant, etc.) the pattern of behavior will remain the same as other examples of this interaction. This will cause different scenarios to play out even though the confession is the same.  Boal argues that this is an extraordinarily rich technique that has many variants: for example, the same ritual may be explored by its participants exchanging masks or it may be enacted by people from different social classes.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Organizations==

===International Theatre of the Oppressed Organisation===
Inspired by Augusto Boal, this Organisation links other Theatre of the Oppressed groups to one another. The idea is that others will help groups organize themselves and create new centers for Theatres of the Oppressed. There are links to other organisations involved with this projects so anyone can contact anyone else involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatreoftheoppressed.org/en/index.php?nodeID=1&lt;/ref&gt; This online Organisation allows others to share information about the Theatre of the Oppressed.

The largest single organisation in the Theatre of the Oppressed network is Jana Sanskriti. Set up by Sanjoy Ganguly in the Sunderbans, a rural area outside Calcutta in the Bay of Bengal, Jana Sanskriti has a membership of over 40,000, 30 theatre teams, and an impressive record of art and activism which has resulted in major improvements in health, infrastructure, welfare benefits, education and social awareness through the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjoy Ganguly, Forum Theatre and Democracy in India, London, Routledge, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Boal's ideas have been widely accepted and used by theatre groups in [[Mozambique]] after the end of the civil war in 1992 to explain the need for reconciliation and to discuss topics such as avoiding landmines, voting in the first democratic elections and the rights of peasants under the new land law.
Grupo de Teatro dos Oprimidos - Maputo was founded in 2001 after Alvim Cossa spent six months studying theater methodology in Rio de Janeiro by a grant from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  It has presented plays such as ''[[O meu marido esta a negar]]'' (My Husband is in Denial), documented as a film by [[Rogério Manjate]], which discusses HIV/AIDS avoidance and treatment. This play is presented in public places - markets, schools and businesses - and the public is invited to attend and present their own solutions to the unequal power relations shown in the play. The result is more effective than a lecture in Portuguese or distribution of written material to a largely illiterate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">'''Unfigured bass''', less commonly known as '''under-figured bass''', is a kind of [[musical notation]] used during the Baroque music era in Western [[Classical music]] (ca. 1600–1750) in which a [[basso continuo]] performer playing a chordal instrument (e.g., [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], or [[lute]]) improvises a chordal accompaniment from a notated [[bass line]] which lacks the guidance of figures indicating which harmonies should be played above the bass note (see [[figured bass]]).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Lester, Joel (1994), ''Compositional Theory in the Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Figured bass parts have numbers or accidentals below the bass line which indicate which intervals above the bass should be played in the chord. However, not all basso continuo parts from the Baroque period were figured.

==History==
From the earliest days of [[thoroughbass]], [[composers]] and copyists have been chastised for providing bass parts without any figures to guide performers. Despite perennial complaints, however, unfigured basses persisted right through the eighteenth century. Though it is speculated that unfigured basses would not have existed if it were not for the suggestion of harmonies in bass lines of the time.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Performance===
In the early [[Baroque music|baroque]] period published parts were as likely to be unfigured as figured, leading to unusual clashes of [[harmony]] on a first reading. In an effort to perform a piece the first time without such harmonic clashes, various methods were devised and used to anticipate the harmonic structure and progression of a piece.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Among these are:

*Specific chords might be placed over a given [[solmization]] syllable, or an easily identified note, such as a sharped note.
*Specific chords might be applied to various patterns of bass intervals.
*Model bass lines with chords might be learned by rote to be used whenever applicable.
*Or specific chords might be placed over particular scale degrees.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Unfigured bass notes in an otherwise figured part===
[[File:Purcell diatonic chromaticism.png|thumb|right|300px|The recitative portion of this Purcell excerpt is mostly figured (i.e., almost every bass note has numbers and/or accidental symbols underneath it to indicate the harmony).  The last three bass notes here (the first three notes of the subsequent aria)  are unfigured. A continuo musician would then revert to deducing harmonies based on the scale function of each note, or not adding any harmonies (playing [[tasto solo]]) through the initial phrase.]]
In a figured bass part, not all bass notes were necessarily figured. By convention, bass notes of root-position chords ({{su|b=3|p=5}}) were often left unfigured. Exceptions to this rule, however, abound, as in the Purcell excerpt shown here.

===Pedagogy===
Many music masters in the [[Baroque]] period educated students in the art of playing unfigured bass accompaniment fluently. Many pieces such as [[partimento |Partimenti]] were written for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Sanguinetti, Giorgio (2012), ''The Art of Partimento: History, Theory, and Practice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin-WZB-2007.jpg|thumb|WZB Berlin Social Science Center]]

The '''WZB Berlin Social Science Center''' ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung}}, '''WZB'''), also known by its German initials WZB, is an internationally renowned [[research institute]] for the [[social sciences]], the largest such institution in Europe not affiliated with a university.

It was founded in 1969 through an all-party initiative of the German ''[[Bundestag]]''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/chronik.en.htm "Brief Timeline of the WZB"], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; Around 140 German and foreign sociologists, political scientists, economists, historians, statisticians, computer scientists and legal scholars work in the WZB conducting [[basic research]] on selected social and political issues, concentrating on the industrialized societies of Japan and the West, as well as the transformations of Central and Eastern Europe and China. The question of globalization is of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/selbstverst.en.htm "Positioning WZB Research in the Scientific Landscape"], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research areas==
The WZB is organized into four research areas:

# [[Education]], [[employment|work]] and life opportunities
# [[Market (economics)|Market]] [[policies]]
# [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic impacts]]
# [[Civil society]], [[War|conflicts]] and [[democracy]]

Constituted as a non-profit [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|limited liability company (GmbH)]], ownership is shared between the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] (75 percent) and the city-state of [[Berlin]] (25 percent).&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; WZB is a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]].

Although not a university body, it collaborates with [[Free University of Berlin]], [[Hertie School of Governance]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], [[Technical University of Berlin]], as well as with research institutions abroad. Many WZB scientists are also university professors or hold teaching assignments.

Recent presidents of the WZB have included [[Meinolf Dierkes]] (1980–1987), [[Wolfgang Zapf]] (1987–1994), [[Friedhelm Neidhardt]] (1994–2000), and historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] (2001–2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/ehemalige.en.htm Former Presidents], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is sociologist [[Jutta Allmendinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wzb.eu/wzb/allmendinger.en.htm Prof. Jutta Allmendinger, curriculum vitae], accessed 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

WZB is said to be the largest such research institution for the social sciences in [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Around 140 social scientists are conducting research on the developmental trends, problems of adaptation, and possibilities for innovation in modern societies.

The [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[Berlin|federal state of Berlin]] have been shareholders and main funders since 1976.

WZB headquarters on [[Landwehrkanal]] in [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Berlin-Tiergarten]] was designed 1979–1988 by the British architects [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Michael Wilford]] integrating the 1894 building of [[:de:Reichsversicherungsamt|Reichsversicherungsamt]].

== A.SK Social Science Award and Fellowships ==
Since 2007 the WZB grants the A.SK Award and Fellowships biannually:&lt;ref name="wzb.eu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A.SK Social Science Award {{!}} WZB|url = https://www.wzb.eu/en/about-the-wzb/ask-award|website = www.wzb.eu|accessdate = 2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The 100,000 Euro A.SK Social Science Award is one of the best-endowed awards in the social sciences.

'''Windham College''' was a [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Putney, Vermont|Putney]], [[Vermont]] on the campus of what is now [[Landmark College]].

==History==
Windham was founded in 1951 by Walter F. Hendricks as the Vermont Institute of Special Studies. The school's initial aim was to help foreign students improve their [[English language]] skills to enable them to meet the requirements for attending U.S. institutions. In 1954, the institution was renamed Windham College and began offering courses in the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, earning accreditation in December, 1967. Eugene Winslow succeeded Hendricks as president in 1964, and served for ten years. Under his tenure the college was relocated to an [[Edward Durell Stone]]-designed campus outside the village. The academic campus consisted of five buildings: Humanities, Library, Sciences on one side, Fine Arts and the Student Union across the green, all connected by a [[colonnade]]. On the hill above stood the five major dormitories, Aiken, Frost, Hendricks, Stone and Dorm Five, as well as two smaller residences, Chumley and Dorm Two.

Under President Winslow, student enrollment grew from 160 to a peak of 935. By 1975, under college president Harrison Symmes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/starnewsonline/obituary.aspx?n=harrison-matthews-symmes&amp;pid=142695472|title=Harrison Matthews Symmes's Obituary on Wilmington Star-News|website=Wilmington Star-News}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite aggressive recruitment and placement of Middle Eastern students, the number of students had fallen to 450, perhaps due to the end of the [[Vietnam War]] and the decreased demand for student deferments.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}} When it closed in 1978, &lt;ref&gt;Putney Historical Society, [http://www.putneyvt.org/history_time.php History Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; there were only 254 students.

In 1978, there were more than 75 international students invited from Middle Eastern countries to help the school sustain its financially problematic existence, but it closed unceremoniously, in the middle of the cold Vermont winter, two weeks prior to the winter holidays.  Stranded international students were forced to leave the school premises by the order of local sheriff, and all of the dormitories were vacated and padlocked. Most international students lost their tuition money (and their boarding costs) that had been paid in advance four weeks prior, and were forced to disperse to other parts of the USA or to return to their countries. Most of the foreign students were guided to another local school{{which|date=July 2015}} that helped them to take shelter during the cold winter for a short period, in hopes of absorbing them as new students or for humanitarian reasons.

Walter Hendricks also founded the still functioning [[Marlboro College]] in [[Marlboro, Vermont]], west of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], as well as Mark Hopkins College whose main (and only) administration and classroom building was in a mansion on [[Vermont Route 9|Route 9]] in Brattleboro. Mark Hopkins College was accredited by the State of Vermont and authorized to grant bachelor's degrees; it closed in 1977.

[[John Irving]] taught at Windham when he wrote his first novel, ''[[Setting Free the Bears]]''. Part of Irving's novel ''[[Last Night in Twisted River]]'' is set around Putney, where a character teaches at Windham. Irving writes in the novel: "Windham College was an architectural eyesore on an otherwise beautiful piece of land."

[[Pearl S. Buck]] was a trustee of the college.
