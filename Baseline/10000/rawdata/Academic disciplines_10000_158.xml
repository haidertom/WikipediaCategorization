&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:air_source_heat_pump_principle.jpg|200px|thumb|A visual representation of the air source heat pump principle|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 23 January 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

An '''air source [[heat pump]]''' (ASHP) is a system which transfers heat from outside to inside a building, or vice versa. Under the principles of [[vapor compression refrigeration]], an ASHP uses a [[refrigerant]] system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called "reverse-cycle air conditioners".

In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply. The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house. When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Description==
[[Air]] at any temperature above [[absolute zero]] contains some energy. An air-source heat pump transfers ('pumps') some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building. This can provide space heating and/or hot water. A single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating.

The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.

The main components of an air-source heat pump are:
* An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air
* An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or  underfloor circuits and/or a domestic hot water tank

Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric heater using the same energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homebuilding.co.uk/2012/05/09/heat-pumps-the-real-cost/ Heat Pumps: The Real Cost]&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison to gas as a primary heat source, however, the lifetime cost of an air source heat pump may be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Use of gas may be associated with higher carbon emissions, depending upon how the electricity is generated.

A "standard" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about {{convert|-15|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air source heat pumps / Choosing a renewable technology |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generating-energy/Choosing-a-renewable-technology/Air-source-heat-pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}--&gt; At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures.

==In cold climates==
An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Mitsubishi model provides heat at −35&amp;nbsp;°C, but the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature. At −30&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitsubishi ZUBA Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps |url=http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |publisher=Encore Heating and Cooling, Kanata, Ontario |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021195035/http://encore-geothermal.ca/sustainable-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps/ |archivedate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to −30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuba-Central|url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|accessdate=15 October 2014|page=5|quote=Zuba-Central’s COP ranges from 1.4 to 3.19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731072149/http://mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac/PDF/zuba-central/Zuba-Central_Catalogue.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed [[ground source heat pump]]s in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Air Source Heat Pumps A Threat To Geothermal Heat Pump Suppliers?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomkonrad/2014/01/15/are-air-source-heat-pumps-a-threat-to-geothermal-heat-pump-suppliers/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Natural Resources Canada]] found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP. (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below −30&amp;nbsp;°C. The record low for Ottawa is −36&amp;nbsp;°C.) The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when considering only energy efficiency in the home. When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories ([[Alberta]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation. (The energy savings in [[Saskatchewan]] were marginal. Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) Despite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of [[Quebec]], which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.) The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system. However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil. The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil. The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating. Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP. (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil. Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) The report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Climate Air Source Heat Pumps: Results from Testing at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology |url=http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |ref=NRC |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020150417/http://www.chba.ca/uploads/TRC/May%202013/Cold%20Climate%20Air%20Source%20Heat%20Pumps%20Presentation%20-%20May%202013.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- unreliable sources: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions by Danfoss Heat Pumps|url=http://www.ecoheatpumps.co.uk/heat_pump_faq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How air source heat pumps work from HomeTips.com|url=http://www.hometips.com/heatpumps-airsource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors. The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years.

==Usage==
Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer, though it is not true air conditioning without a facility to adjust the humidity of the inside air. Though the [[cost]] of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a [[Geothermal heat pump|''ground source'' heat pump]], because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions.

ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. [[Propane]], natural gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces can provide this supplementary heat.

All-electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to [[Forced air|central forced-air systems]] and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric [[fireplace insert]]s can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to [[solar panel]]s as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source.

Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost-effective if time of use electricity rates are available. Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Franklin Energy Services, LLC |title=Air Source Heat Pump Efficiency Gains from  Low Ambient Temperature Operation Using  Supplemental Electric Heating: Thermal Storage Supplemental Heating Systems |url=http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |publisher=Minnesota Division of Energy Resources; Minnesota Department of Commerce |accessdate=15 October 2014 |page=9 |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611123108/http://mn.gov/commerce/energy/images/CIP-AirSource-Pump-Report.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower.

The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is  between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 5&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F to 41&amp;nbsp;°F){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate.  The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less.  As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.

It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat. The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature [[underfloor heating]] system be installed instead. Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained.

==Technology==

[[File:Refrigerator-cycle.svg|thumb|A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor]]
Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a [[refrigerant]] through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils. Like in a refrigerator, a [[gas compressor|compressor]], [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] and [[evaporator]] are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder [[liquid]] and hotter [[gas]] states.

When the liquid refrigerant at a low [[temperature]] and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or [[vapor]]): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as [[latent heat]]. The gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas.

Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure [[valve]] into heat exchanger coils.  There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored [[latent heat]] to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system. The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or [[fan (mechanical)|fan]].

The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle.

Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air.

==Efficiency ratings==
The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the [[Coefficient of performance]] (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of −3&amp;nbsp;°C to 10&amp;nbsp;°C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3–3.5.

In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day.&lt;ref&gt;Efficiency of heat pumps in changing conditions, http://www.icax.co.uk/Air_Source_Heat_Pumps.html&lt;/ref&gt; The heat pump's performance is limited by the [[Carnot cycle]] and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach −18&amp;nbsp;°C / 0&amp;nbsp;°F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to −20&amp;nbsp;°C, pushing the break-even figure downward to −30&amp;nbsp;°C (−22&amp;nbsp;°F). A [[ground source heat pump]] has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air.

The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency. Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as [[air conditioning unit]]s, mainly for use in summer temperatures. Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP ratings and an extended life cycle. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator.

Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the [[heating seasonal performance factor]] (HSPF) and [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER) respectively.

In units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]], the COP rating is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60&amp;nbsp;°C or to heat conventional [[central heating]] systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array).

==Risks and precautions==
*Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as −30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all.
*An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or [[pellet fuel]] furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures.

==Controversy==

Units charged with [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]] [[refrigerants]] are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, as measured in [[global warming potential]] (GWP) and [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP). Recent government mandates{{where?|date=February 2013}} have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Impact on electric utilities==

While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities. The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. A study in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]], where [[diesel generator]]s are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evaluation of Air Source Heat Pump Technology in Yukon|url=http://www.energy.gov.yk.ca/pdf/air_source_heat_pumps_final_may2013_v04.pdf|publisher=Government of Yukon’s Energy Solution Centre and Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost effective heating alternative for Yukon residents.
As [[wind farm]]s are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from [[wind turbine]]s and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

'''Arsenic contamination of groundwater''' is a form of [[groundwater pollution]] which is often due to naturally occurring high concentrations of [[arsenic]] in deeper levels of [[groundwater]]. It is a high-profile problem due to the use of deep [[tubewell]]s for water supply in the [[Ganges Delta]], causing serious [[arsenic poisoning]] to large numbers of people. A 2007 study found that over 137 million people in more than 70 countries are probably affected by arsenic poisoning of drinking water. The problem became serious health concern after mass poisoning of water in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Speciation of arsenic compounds in water==

Arsenic contaminated water typically contains [[arsenous acid]] and [[arsenic acid]] or their derivatives. Their names as "acids" is a formality, these species are not aggressive acids but are merely the soluble forms of arsenic near neutral pH. These compounds are extracted from the underlying rocks that surround the aquifer. Arsenic acid tends to exist as the ions [HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral water, whereas arsenous acid is not ionized.

==Contamination specific nations and regions==

=== Pakistan===

66% of 1200 samples tested contained arsenic above WHO recommended limit, threatening over 60 million residents. 50-60 million residents consume water with arsenic levels greater than 50 micrograms of arsenic per liter, levels far passing acceptable levels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/arsenic-drinking-water-threatens-60-million-pakistan|title=Arsenic in drinking water threatens up to 60 million in Pakistan|date=2017-08-23|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Bangladesh is the most affected country by arsenic poisoning through drinking water. Govt. and other agencies like UNICEF installed wells to provide fresh water in underdeveloped areas of Bangladesh, but later on they found disease related to consumption of this water. About 7-11 million wells or hand pumped wells are providing arsenic polluted water to local people. In 2008, approximately 57 million residents used water contaminated with arsenic from these shallow wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Addy|first1=Susan|title=Electrochemical Arsenic Remediation for Rural Bangladesh|journal=University of California, Berkeley|date=Fall 2008|accessdate=|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20% of the total deaths are related to arsenic related cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uddin|first=Riaz|last2=Huda|first2=Naz Hasan|date=May 2011|title=Arsenic Poisoning in Bangladesh|journal=Oman Medical Journal|volume=26|issue=3|pages=207|doi=10.5001/omj.2011.51|issn=1999-768X|pmc=3191694|pmid=22043419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-the-west-poisoned-bangladesh-1924631.html|title=How the West poisoned Bangladesh|date=2010-03-21|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/06/bangladesh-20-million-drink-arsenic-laced-water|title=Bangladesh: 20 Million Drink Arsenic-Laced Water|date=2016-04-06|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile===

An analysis of water and food consumption in [[Socaire]], a rural village in [[Chile]], found that between November 2008 and September 2009, the total intake of arsenic by the villagers correlated with the amount of water and local produce consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=Oscar Pablo|last2=Arcos|first2=Rafael|last3=Tapia|first3=Yasna|last4=Pastene|first4=Rubén|last5=Velez|first5=Dínoraz|last6=Devesa|first6=Vicenta|last7=Montoro|first7=Rosa|last8=Aguilera|first8=Valeska|last9=Becerra|first9=Miriam|date=2015-05-22|title=Estimation of Arsenic Intake from Drinking Water and Food (Raw and Cooked) in a Rural Village of Northern Chile.

=== India and Bangladesh===

Arsenic contamination of the groundwater in Bangladesh is a serious problem. Prior to the 1970s, Bangladesh had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Ineffective water purification and sewage systems as well as periodic monsoons and flooding exacerbated these problems. As a solution, UNICEF and the World Bank advocated the use of wells to tap into deeper groundwater. Millions of wells were constructed as a result. Because of this action, infant mortality and diarrheal illness were reduced by fifty percent. However, with over 8 million wells constructed, approximately one in five of these wells is now contaminated with arsenic above the government's drinking water standard.

In the [[Ganges Delta]], the affected wells are typically more than 20 meters and less than 100 meters deep.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Groundwater closer to the surface typically has spent a shorter time in the ground, therefore likely absorbing a lower concentration of arsenic; water deeper than 100 m is exposed to much older sediments which have already been depleted of arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted in Bangladesh involved the analysis of thousands of water samples as well as hair, nail, and urine samples. They found 900 villages with arsenic above the government limit.

Criticism has been leveled at the [[Aid agency|aid agencies]], who denied the problem during the 1990s while millions of [[tube well]]s were sunk. The aid agencies later hired foreign experts who recommended treatment plants that were inappropriate to the conditions, were regularly breaking down, or were not removing the arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025450.600-drinking-at-the-wests-toxic-well.html Interview: Drinking at the west's toxic well] 31 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Bengal, India, water is mostly supplied from rivers. Groundwater comes from deep tubewells, which are few in number. Because of the low quantity of deep tubewells, the risk of arsenic poisoning in West Bengal is comparatively less.&lt;ref name=timesofindia&gt;[[The Times of India]], [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/864169.cms 'Use surface water. Stop digging'], interview, 26 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organisation, "In Bangladesh, West Bengal (India), and some other areas most drinking-water used to be collected from open dug wells and ponds with little or no arsenic, but with contaminated water transmitting diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis. Programmes to provide 'safe' drinking-water over the past 30 years have helped to control these diseases, but in some areas they have had the unexpected side-effect of exposing the population to another health problem—arsenic."&lt;ref name=who&gt;[[World Health Organization]], [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs210/en/index.html Arsenic in Drinking Water], accessed 5 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
The acceptable level as defined by WHO for maximum concentrations of arsenic in safe drinking water is 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The Bangladesh government's standard is a fivefold greater rate, with 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L being considered safe. WHO has defined the areas under threat: Seven of the twenty districts of West Bengal have been reported to have ground water arsenic concentrations above 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The total population in these seven districts is over 34 million while the number using arsenic-rich water is more than 1 million (above 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L). That number increases to 1.3 million when the concentration is above 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L. According to a British Geological Survey study in 1998 on shallow tube-wells in 61 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh, 46 percent of the samples were above 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L and 27 percent were above 0.050&amp;nbsp;mg/L. When combined with the estimated 1999 population, it was estimated that the number of people exposed to arsenic concentrations above 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L is 28-35 million and the number of those exposed to more than 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L is 46-57 million (BGS, 2000).&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Throughout Bangladesh, as tube wells get tested for concentrations of arsenic, ones which are found to have arsenic concentrations over the amount considered safe are painted red to warn residents that the water is not safe to drink.

One solution is "By using surface water and instituting effective withdrawal regulation. West Bengal and Bangladesh are flooded with surface water. We should first regulate proper watershed management. Treat and use available surface water, rain-water, and others. The way we're doing [it] at present is not advisable."&lt;ref name=timesofindia/&gt; Another avenue would be looking at the nutrition content which is also seen to be responsible for mitigating the effects of Arsenic. Malnutrition is seen to increase the adverse effects of arsenic.&lt;ref name="Pierce et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Brandon L.|author2=Maria Argos |author3=Yu Chen |author4=Stephanie Melkonian |author5=Faruque Parvez |author6=Tariqul Islam |author7=Alauddin Ahmed |author8=Rabiul Hasan |author9=Paul J.

All these districts are situated close to large rivers like [[Ganga]] and [[Budhi Gandak|Gandak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Groundwater in 13 Districts of Bihar contaminated with Arsenic|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/09/groundwater-in-13-districts-of-bihar-contiminated-with-arsenic/|work=Biharprabha News|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===

The central portion of Argentina is affected by arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Specifically, the La Pampa produces water containing 4-5300 microgram per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smedley P.L., Kinniburgh D.G., Macdonald D.M.J., Nicolli H.B., Barros A.J., Tullio J.O., Pearce J.M., Alonso M.S. | year = 2005 | title = Arsenic associations in sediments from the loess aquifer of La Pampa, Argentina | url = | journal = Applied Geochemistry | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 989–1016 | doi = 10.1016/j.apgeochem.2004.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Regulation====

A drinking water standard of 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L (equal to 50 [[parts per billion]], or ppb) arsenic was originally established in the United States by the Public Health Service in 1942. After the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (SDWA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was given the power to set the maximum containment levels (MCLs) of contaminants in public water supplies. In 1996 Congress amended the SDWA and created a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to provide loans for water supply improvements, which increased the EPA's power to set mandates. This amendment created the 'costs and benefits rule' to determine whether the cost of implementing new MCLs outweighs the health benefits. To maximize the costs and benefits of setting new MLCs, the EPA began allowing more affordable technology to be substituted that did not fully meet MLC standards because it was more affordable.

The EPA studied the pros and cons of lowering the arsenic [[Maximum Contaminant Level]] (MCL) for years in the late 1980s and 1990s. No action was taken until January 2001, when the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration in its final weeks promulgated a new standard of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L (10 ppb) to take effect January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of arsenic regulation'', Southwest Hydrology, May/June 2002, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration suspended the [[midnight regulation]], but after some months of study, the new EPA administrator [[Christine Todd Whitman]] approved the new 10 ppb arsenic standard and its original effective date of January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''EPA announces arsenic standard for drinking water of 10 parts per billion'', EPA press release, 10/31/2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Many locations exceed this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many public water supply systems across the United States obtained their water supply from groundwater that had met the old 50 ppb arsenic standard but exceeded the new 10 ppb MCL. These utilities searched for either an alternative supply or an inexpensive treatment method to remove the arsenic from their water. In Arizona, an estimated 35 percent of water-supply wells were put out of compliance by the new regulation; in California, the percentage was 38 percent .&lt;ref&gt;Alison Bohlen (2002) ''States move forward to meet new arsenic standard'', Southwest Hydrology, May/June 2002, p.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper arsenic MCL continues to be debated. Some have argued that the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others have argued that 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; [[New Jersey]] has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Megan A. Ferguson and others, Lowering the detection limit for arsenic: implications for a future practical quantitation limit, [[American Water Works Association]] Journal, Aug. 2007, p.92-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of private water wells in the Appalachian mountains found that six percent of the wells had arsenic above the U.S. MCL of 0.010&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Shiber, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16437433 "Arsenic in domestic well water and health in Central Appalachia, USA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case studies and incidents====

[[Fallon, Nevada]] has long been known to have groundwater with relatively high arsenic concentrations (in excess of 0.08&amp;nbsp;mg/L).&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Rubel Jr. and Steven W. Hathaway (1985) ''Pilot Study for removal of arsenic from drinking water at the Fallon, Nevada, Naval Air Station'', Environmental Protection Agency, EPA/600/S2-85/094.&lt;/ref&gt; Even some surface waters, such as the [[Verde River]] in [[Arizona]], sometimes exceed 0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/L arsenic, especially during low-flow periods when the river flow is dominated by groundwater discharge.&lt;ref&gt;M. Taqueer A. Qureshi (1995) ''Sources of Arsenic in the Verde River and Salt River Watersheds, Arizona'', M.S. thesis, Arizona State University, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in a contiguous six-county area of southeastern Michigan investigated the relationship between moderate arsenic levels and 23 selected disease outcomes. Disease outcomes included several types of cancer, diseases of the circulatory and respiratory system, diabetes mellitus, and kidney and liver diseases. Elevated mortality rates were observed for all diseases of the circulatory system. The researchers acknowledged a need to replicate their findings.&lt;ref&gt;Jaymie R.

=== Nepal ===

Nepal is subject to a serious problem with arsenic contamination. The problem is most severe in the [[Terai]] region, the worst being near [[Nawalparasi District]], where 26 percent of shallow wells failed to meet WHO standard of 10 ppb. A study by Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Environment in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] showed that 72% of deep wells failed to meet the WHO standard, and 12% failed to meet the Nepali standard of 50 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-filters-to-provide-arsenic-free-drinking-water&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water purification solutions==
Access to clean drinking water is fraught with political, socio-economic, and cultural inequities. In practice, many water treatment strategies tend to be temporary fixes to a larger problem, often prolonging the social issues while treating the scientific ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard Bart|last2=Hanchett|first2=Suzanne|last3=Khan|first3=Mohidul Hoque|date=2010-01-01|title=The socio-economics of arsenic removal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo735|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2–3|doi=10.1038/ngeo735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific studies have shown that interdisciplinary approaches to water purification are especially important to consider, and long-lasting improvements involve larger perspectives than strict scientific approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karr|first=James R.|last2=Dudley|first2=Daniel R.|date=1981-01-01|title=Ecological perspective on water quality goals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01866609|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1007/BF01866609|issn=0364-152X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small-scale water treatment===

A review of methods to remove arsenic from groundwater in Pakistan summarizes the most technically viable inexpensive methods.&lt;ref&gt;Fatima Hashmi and Joshua M. Pearce, "Viability of Small-Scale Arsenic-Contaminated Water Purification Technologies for Sustainable Development in Pakistan", Sustainable Development, 19(4), pp. 223-234, 2011. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122394419/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 pdf][http://hdl.handle.net/1974/6828 Open access full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Most small-scale treatments focus on water after it has left the distribution site, and are thus more focused on quick, temporary fixes.

A simpler and less expensive form of arsenic removal is known as the [[Sono arsenic filter]], using three pitchers containing cast iron turnings and sand in the first pitcher and wood activated carbon and sand in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unu.edu/env/Arsenic/Munir.pdf |title=Evaluation of Performance of Sono 3-Kolshi Filter for Arsenic Removal from Groundwater Using Zero Valent Iron Through Laboratory and Field Studies }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(272&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic buckets can also be used as filter containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://phys4.harvard.edu/~wilson/arsenic/remediation/SONO/As%20filtration%20pictures.pdf |title=SONO ARSENIC FILTER FROM BANGLADESH - 1 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(102&amp;nbsp;KiB)}} - pictures with descriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that thousands of these systems are in use and can last for years while avoiding the toxic waste disposal problem inherent to conventional arsenic removal plants. Although novel, this filter has not been certified by any sanitary standards such as NSF, ANSI, WQA and does not avoid toxic waste disposal similar to any other iron removal process.

In the United States small "under the sink" units have been used to remove arsenic from drinking water. This option is called "point of use" treatment. The most common types of domestic treatment use the technologies of adsorption (using media such as Bayoxide E33, GFH, or titanium dioxide) or [[reverse osmosis]].  [[Ion exchange]] and [[activated alumina]] have been considered but not commonly used.

[[Chaff]]-based filters have been reported to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron Electrocoagulation (Fe-EC)'''
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Iron Electrocoagulation Diagram.gif|thumb|Simplified Diagram of how Fe-EC operates]] --&gt;
In iron electrocoagulation, iron is dissolved nonstop using electricity, and the resulting ferric hydroxides, oxyhydoxides, and oxides form an absorbent readily attracted to arsenic.

===Large-scale water treatment===

In some places, such as the United States, all the water supplied to residences by utilities must meet primary (health-based) drinking water standards. Regulations may need large-scale treatment systems to remove arsenic from the water supply. The effectiveness of any method depends on the chemical makeup of a particular water supply. The aqueous chemistry of arsenic is complex, and may affect the removal rate that can be achieved by a particular process.

Some large utilities with multiple water supply wells could shut down those wells with high arsenic concentrations, and produce only from wells or surface water sources that meet the arsenic standard. Other utilities, however, especially small utilities with only a few wells, may have no available water supply that meets the arsenic standard.
 
'''Coagulation/filtration''' (also known as [[flocculation#Water treatment|flocculation]]) removes arsenic by [[coprecipitation]] and adsorption using iron coagulants. Coagulation/filtration using [[alum]] is already used by some utilities to remove suspended solids and may be adjusted to remove arsenic.

'''[[Iron oxide adsorption]]''' filters the water through a granular medium containing ferric oxide. Ferric oxide has a high affinity for adsorbing dissolved metals such as arsenic. The iron oxide medium eventually becomes saturated, and must be replaced. The sludge disposal is a problem here too.

'''[[Activated alumina]]''' is an adsorbent that effectively removes arsenic. Activated alumina columns connected to shallow tube wells in India and Bangladesh have removed both As(III) and As(V) from groundwater for decades. Long-term column performance has been possible through the efforts of community-elected water committees that collect a local water tax for funding operations and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SARKAR|first=S|author2=GUPTA, A|author3=BISWAS, R|author4=DEB, A|author5=GREENLEAF, J|author6=SENGUPTA, A|title=Well-head arsenic removal units in remote villages of Indian subcontinent: Field results and performance evaluation|journal=Water Research|date=1 May 2005|volume=39|issue=10|pages=2196–2206|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.04.002|pmid=15913703}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to remove undesirably high concentrations of [[fluoride]].

'''[[Ion exchange]]''' has long been used as a [[water softening]] process, although usually on a single-home basis. Traditional anion exchange resins are effective in removing As(V), but not As(III), or [[arsenic trioxide]], which doesn't have a net charge. Effective long-term ion exchange removal of arsenic requires a trained operator to maintain the column.

Both '''[[Reverse osmosis]]''' and '''[[electrodialysis]]''' (also called ''electrodialysis reversal'') can remove arsenic with a net ionic charge. (Note that arsenic oxide, As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a common form of arsenic in groundwater that is soluble, but has no net charge.) Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce [[total dissolved solids]] and therefore improve taste. A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called [[brine]], or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.

'''Subterranean Arsenic Removal (SAR) Technology''' [http://www.insituarsenic.org SAR Technology]

In subterranean arsenic removal (SAR), aerated groundwater is recharged back into the aquifer to create an oxidation zone which can trap iron and arsenic on the soil particles through adsorption process. The oxidation zone created by aerated water boosts the activity of the arsenic-oxidizing microorganisms which can oxidize arsenic from +3 to +5 state [http://www.insituarsenic.org SAR Technology]. No chemicals are used and almost no sludge is produced during operational stage since iron and arsenic compounds are rendered inactive in the aquifer itself. Thus toxic waste disposal and the risk of its future mobilization is prevented. Also, it has very long operational life, similar to the long lasting tube wells drawing water from the shallow aquifers.

Six such SAR plants, funded by the World Bank and constructed by Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, Barrackpore &amp; Queen's University Belfast, UK are operating in West Bengal. Each plant has been delivering more than 3,000 litres of arsenic and iron-free water daily to the rural community. The first community water treatment plant based on SAR technology was set up at Kashimpore near Kolkata in 2004 by a team of European and Indian engineers led by Bhaskar Sen Gupta of Queen's University Belfast for TiPOT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worstpolluted.org/ 12 Cases of Cleanup &amp; Success]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worstpolluted.org/projects_reports/display/76 "World's Worst Polluted Places Report 2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=can-the-worlds-most-polluted-places-09-10-29&amp;SID=mail&amp;sc=emailfriend Scientific American]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE59R4BE20091028?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 Reuters Global]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAR technology had been awarded Dhirubhai Ambani Award, 2010 from IChemE UK for Chemical Innovation. Again, SAR was the winner of the [http://www.thestandrewsprize.com/lists/2010.htm St. Andrews Award for Environment, 2010]. The SAR Project was selected by the Blacksmith Institute - New York &amp; Green Cross- Switzerland as one of the "12 Cases of Cleanup &amp; Success" in the World's Worst Polluted Places Report 2009. (Refer: [http://www.worstpolluted.org/files/FileUpload/files/2009-report/Blacksmith-Institute-Green-Cross-Switzerland-WWPP-Report-2009.pdf www.worstpolluted.org]).

Currently, large scale SAR plants are being installed in US, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

==Dietary intake==

Researchers from Bangladesh and the [[United Kingdom]] have claimed that dietary intake of arsenic adds a significant amount to total intake where contaminated water is used for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2975&amp;language=1 | author = Mustak Hossain | title = Toxic rice harvested in southwestern Bangladesh | publisher = SciDev.Net | date = 2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increase in Rice Grain Arsenic for Regions of Bangladesh Irrigating Paddies with Elevated Arsenic in Groundwaters | journal = Environ.

The '''BTO'''&lt;ref name="Gremse2011"&gt;Gremse, M., Chang, A., Schomburg, I., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Ebeling, C., Schomburg, D. (2011): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/suppl_1/D507.long The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO): the first all-integrating ontology of all organisms for enzyme sources]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 39 (Database issue): D507–D513&lt;/ref&gt; ('''B'''RENDA '''T'''issue '''O'''ntology) represents a comprehensive structured [[encyclopedia]]. It provides terms, classifications, and definitions of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], anatomical structures, plant parts, [[cell culture]]s, [[cell type]]s, and [[cell culture|cell lines]] of organisms from all taxonomic groups ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungis]], [[protozoa|protozoon]]) as enzyme sources. The information is connected to the functional data in the [[BRENDA]] ("BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase“)&lt;ref name="Schomburg20132"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Placzek, S., Söhngen, C., Rother. M., Lang, M., Munaretto, C., Ulas, S., Stelzer, M., Grote, A., Scheer, M., Schomburg, D. (2013): „[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D764.long BRENDA in 2013: integrated reactions, kinetic data, enzyme function data, improved disease classification: new options and contents in BRENDA]“, ''Nucleic Acids Res.'', 41 (Database issue): D764–D772&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzyme]] information system.

BTO is one of the first tissue-specific [[ontology|ontologies]] in [[life sciences]], not restricted to a specific organism or a specific organism group providing a user-friendly access to the wide range of tissue and cell-type information. Databases, such as ''Ontology Lookup Service'' or ses, such as ''[[MIRIAM Registry]]'' or  of the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI-EMBL]], the ''TissueDistributionDB'', including the ''Tissue Synonym Library'' of the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ) in Heidelberg or the ''Bioportal'' plattform of the [[National Center for Biomedical Ontology]] in Stanford, USA rely on BTO and implement the encyclopedia as an essential repository of information into their respective plattform.

BTO enables users from [[medical research]] and [[pharmaceutical sciences]] to search for the occurrence and [[histology|histological]] detection of disease-related enzymes in tissues, which play an important role in [[diagnosis]], therapies, and [[drug development]]. In [[biochemistry]] and [[biotechnology]] the organism-specific tissue terms linked to enzyme functional data are an important resource for the understanding of the metabolism and regulation in life sciences. Ontologies represent classification systems that provide controlled and structured vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Schomburg2014"&gt;Schomburg, I., Chang, A., Schomburg, D. (2014): „[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213020914000032 Standardization in enzymology—Data integration in the world’s enzyme information system BRENDA]“, ''Perspectives in Science'', 1: 15–23&lt;/ref&gt; They are important tools to illustrate and to link evolutionary correlations.

Development of BTO started in 2003, aimed to connect the biochemical and molecular biological enzyme data of BRENDA with a hierarchical and standardized collection of tissue-specific terms. The functional enzyme data and information in BRENDA have been manually annotated and structured by experts from biochemistry, biology, and chemistry. By August 2014, the BTO contained over 5,500 terms, linked to 4,000 synonyms and 4,500 definitions. The terms are classified under generic categories, rules, and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO,&lt;ref name="Roncaglia2013"&gt;Roncaglia, P., Martone, M.E., Hill, D.P., Berardini, T.Z., Foulger, R.E., Imam, F.T., Drabkin, H., Mungall, C.J., Lomax, J. (2013): „[http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/20 The Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular Component Ontology: integration with SAO (Subcellular Anatomy Ontology) and other recent developments]“, ''J. Biomed. Semantics'', 4: 20&lt;/ref&gt;), organized as a [[Directed acyclic graph|directed acyclic graph (DAG)]] created using the [[Open-source software|open-source]] OBO-Edit.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;Smith, B., Ashburner, M., Rosse, C., Bard, J., Bug, W., Ceusters, W., Goldberg, L.J., Eilbeck, K., Ireland, A., Mungall, C.J.; OBI Consortium, Leontis, N., Rocca-Serra, P., Ruttenberg, A., Sansone, S.A., Scheuermann, R.H., Shah, N., Whetzel,P.L,, Lewis, S. (2010): „[http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n11/full/nbt1346.html The OBO Foundry: coordinated evolution of ontologies to support biomedical data integration]“, ''Nat.
Biotechnol.'', 25: 1251–1255&lt;/ref&gt; All terms from each level are directly connected the enzyme data in BRENDA. BTO is a suitable tool to distinguish between different enzymes which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

== Content and Features ==

BTO draws upon the comprehensive enzyme specific data of the BRENDA enzyme information system. Presently (August 2014) 90,500 enzyme-organism-tissue specific data from more than 11,000 proteins are stored in BRENDA. These entries were manually annotated from more thant 135,000 different literature references. All terms in BTO are evaluated and classified according to the OBO-format, and are connected by specific relationships. Each term is a distinct entry within the ontology and is automatically assigned to  a unique BTO-identifier (BTO-ID). The BTO-IDs serve as stable accession numbers in order to create cross-references to further external biochemical databases. Further tissue und cell-type specific terms from external databases (i.e. [[UniProt]]) are integrated into BTO.

The terms are classified in 4 main categories (subgraphs):

* animal
* plant
* fungus
* other sources

Further levels are defined below the main categories (=nodes), classifiying the “parent”, “child”, and “grandchild” all connected via specific relationships (=edges)

* is_a (e.g. skeletal muscle fibre is_a muscle fibre)
* part_of (e.g. muscle fibre part_of muscle)
* develops/derives_from (e.g.myoma cell develops/derives_from muscle fibre)
* related_to (description of more general relationships between terms which are not covered by the other ones)

Most of the terms are clearly associated with specific organisms, organs, tissues, or cell types. However, there are several  identical designations for tissues both in plants and animals, e.g. “epidermis”. To distinguish between those tissue terms and to classify them correctly into BTO for plant tissues the prefix “plant” is placed before the term, e.g. “plant epidermis”.

More than 80% of the tissue terms have definitions that describe the meaning and context. These definitions are obtained from i.e. medical dictionaries and cell line databases ([[Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Dictionary]], [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen|DSMZ]]).

== Availability ==

The entries in BTO are updated bi-annually as part of the major update of BRENDA. It is available via the BRENDA website in the category “Ontology Explorer”. The enzyme source terms can be searched via the BTO query form. As a result, the user receives a list of EC numbers which are directly connected to  the enzyme information of BRENDA. It is also possible to search via the BRENDA “Source Tissue” search form (“Classic View”). The result page displays all enzymes which are isolated or detected in the searched tissue term, directly linked to BTO.

BTO and BRENDA are freely accessible for academic users. It can be freely downloaded via the “Ontology Explorer” of the BRENDA website or in the OBO format from “Obofoundry”. Commercial users require a license distributed by the ''biobase GmbH''.

==Life==
Minor graduated from [[Bucknell University]] in 1981&lt;ref name="Bucknell"&gt;{{cite news |title=Barbara Haviland Minor '81, chemical engineering Keeping Her Cool |url=https://www.bucknell.edu/info-about-attending-bucknell/who-we-are/bucknell-stories/alumni-stories/barbara-haviland-minor-81 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |work=Bucknell University |date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering.&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Influence"/&gt;

==Career==
Minor worked at [[DuPont]] from 1981 to 2015, when she moved to the spinoff company [[Chemours]]&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt; in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref name="Salitsky"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Salitsky |first1=Cynthia |title=The Chemours Company's Barbara  H.

In molecular biology, '''BpuJI''' is a type II [[restriction endonuclease]] which recognises the [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] [[Nucleotide sequence|sequence]] 5'-CCCGT and cuts at multiple sites in the surrounding area of the target sequence. The BpuJI protein consists of two distinct modules; an N-terminal DNA recognition domain, and a C-terminal dimerisation and catalysis domain. The N-terminal domain is composed of two [[winged-helix]] subdomains and a disrupted linker subdomain. Target sequence recognition occurs through major groove contacts of [[amino acid]]s in the winged-helix subdomains.&lt;ref name="pmid18433771"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sukackaite R, Grazulis S, Bochtler M, Siksnys V | title = The recognition domain of the BpuJI restriction endonuclease in complex with cognate DNA at 1.3-A resolution | journal = J.

'''Brackish marshes''' develop by [[salt marsh]]es where a significant [[freshwater]] influx dilutes the [[seawater]] to [[brackish]] levels of [[salinity]].  This commonly happens upstream from salt marshes by [[estuaries]] of coastal rivers or near the mouths of coastal rivers with heavy freshwater discharges in the conditions of low [[tidal range]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Field Guide to Coastal Wetland Plants of the Southeastern United States", by Ralph W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Bradford's law''' is a pattern first described by [[Samuel C. Bradford]] in 1934 that estimates the [[exponential decay|exponentially]] [[diminishing returns]] of searching for references in  [[science journal]]s. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Paul E. 
|title=''Bradford's law'', in Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures 
|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=2004-12-12 |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bradfordsLaw.html |accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of related  formulations of the principle.

In many disciplines this pattern is called a [[Pareto distribution]]. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core [[scientific journal]]s for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.

Different researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like [[Zipf's law]], to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty it is sufficient to identify the "core publications" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.

However its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s famous article ''[[As We May Think]]'', [[Eugene Garfield]] at the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His [[Citation index|Science Citation Index]] (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the  discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were core for all of [[hard science]]. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

The result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of "core journals" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.

Bradford's law is also known as '''Bradford's law of scattering''' and as the '''Bradford distribution'''. This law or distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Don 
|title=Bibliometrics and the World Wide Web 
|publisher=University of Toronto Technical Report |year=1997 |url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~donturn/research/bibweb.html |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scattering==
Hjørland and Nicolaisen (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;103) identified three kinds of scattering:
#Lexical scattering. The scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts.
#Semantic scattering. The scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts.
#Subject scattering. The scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

They found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.

==Law's interpretations==

The interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/3q8305kq4154w846 Yatsko V. A. The Interpretation of Bradford’s Law in Terms of Geometric Progression IN: Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics, 2012, Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 112–117.]&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals.  V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (e.g. successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).

The concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer using [[cinematography]]''' recognizes that films with carefully crafted and verified content, using graphics, animations and live-action video, can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people and healthcare professionals.

==History of medical cinematography==

===Late 19th century===

The use of cinematography to enhance healthcare practice and delivery dates back to the late 19th century in Western Europe. [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] (French scientist and physiologist), [[Eugène-Louis Doyen]] (French surgeon), [[Bolesław Matuszewski]] (Polish cameraman, in France his first name was written as Boleslas), and [[Gheorghe Marinescu]] (Romanian neurologist) are some of the pioneers of medical cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Arthur Van Gehuchten takes neurology to the movies. NEUROLOGY 2002;59:1612–1618&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Doyen had his surgeries captured on film. His films were brought into disrepute by the fact that they were copied and shown on fairgrounds. The resulting social prejudice may explain the slow take-off of medical cinematography.  For example, in 1910 someone said the following regarding Doyen’s videos: ,“These pictures savoured of advertisement, and were never popular, save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession.” &lt;ref&gt;Roentgen Cinematography. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2603 (Nov. 19, 1910), p. 1645&lt;/ref&gt;  Doyen’s work, however, marked the distinction between the concepts of ‘film for entertainment’ versus ‘film for medicine’.

In 1893 Marey used the technique to study human physiology and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lKItGNuiY movement]. In 1898 Boleslas Matuszewski recorded medical films in Paris (at the time, the world’s neurologic capital). At [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière and Pitié hospitals]] he filmed surgeries and cases of persons affected by nervous and mental disorders.

Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) studied under renowned French professor [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and returned to Bucharest as Chief Physician at Pantelimon Hospital. Between 1898–1902 he conducted a cinematographic project, recording and analyzing a series of neurological conditions in patients. He perfected the application of filming techniques to clinical [[neurology]] and published five articles based on cinematographic analysis. Marinescu wrote that the role of cinematography is “to complement and even replace, in whatever measure possible, the descriptive exposition of phenomena by more rigorous, more exact analysis, which consists of recording movement with the help of special procedures” &lt;ref&gt;Barboi A C, Goetz C, Musetoiu R. The origins of scientific cinematography and early medical applications. NEUROLOGY 2004;62:2082–2086&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Arthur Van Gehuchten]] (Belgian anatomist and neurologist) began to film neurologic patients and built up a collection of films for teaching purposes. His collection is exceptional both quantitatively and qualitatively.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Idem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century: medical cinematography as [[propaganda]]===

In 1910 [[Thomas Edison]] produced the first ever public [[health education]] film, raising awareness about the prevention of [[tuberculosis]]. The view at the time was that “propagandists saw education as limited to providing facts. Propaganda was designed to control opinions and actions, without having to use direct force. Propaganda appealed to most progressive health reformers as a way of providing genuine popular democratic support for the trained medical elite.

Dr. H. E. Kleinschmidt of the Tuberculosis Association defined good propaganda as ‘mental inoculation’ whose avowed goal was ‘will-control through education’. The goal of health propagandists was not simply to inform but to persuade, to control individual thoughts and actions.” &lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Thomas Edison's Tuberculosis Films: Mass Media and Health Propaganda. The Hastings Center Report, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jun., 1978), pp. 21-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison’s film came under criticism for “the distortions, exaggerations, and inaccuracies inherent in the [[melodrama]] format. The films clearly exaggerated the power of medicine to deal with tuberculosis; and they greatly over dramatized the effects and symptoms of the disease.” &lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

During World War I, the use of medical propaganda appealed to the US government and private agencies, which worked together “to produce and distribute anti-[[venereal disease]] motion pictures, including the feature-length melodramas [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010131/ Fit to Fight] and The End of the Road and other lesser-known films. These movies, originally made for military trainees and war workers, were revised for showing to civilians, as evidence mounted that many soldiers had been infected prior to induction.” &lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Sex Education Films. Isis, Vol. 84, No. 4 (Dec., 1993), pp. 766-768&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical cinematography employed in healthcare===

The 1930s saw the rise of medical cinematography employed to reach goals of [[public health]]. In 1933, the Journal of Communication published an article regarding [[immunization]] propaganda in the US: “Dr. Nash has enlisted the cinematograph film. He has noticed that American films illustrating immunization never show the instant of puncture, so that spectators are left to infer something disagreeable. But in the 16 mm. film taken by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak Ltd.]] in his own clinic the whole operation is photographed, and although now and then there may be a grimace or a hint of nervousness, there is certainly no crying or resistance. The children in the film, quite unrehearsed, behave perfectly. It is an excellent film and should do much to dispel parental apprehensions.” &lt;ref&gt;Immunization Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3769 (Apr. 1, 1933), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1935 issue of the [[British Medical Journal]], one could read the following advice regarding the use of films in public health: “If the medical profession wanted, for example, to introduce widespread [[Preventive healthcare|prophylaxis]] against [[diphtheria]] it could take a leaf out of Papworth's book and tell a story on the films that would help to wipe out diphtheria in a few years' time. It is no good trying to persuade people of the Tightness of this or that measure of health with the sweet voice of reason. It is the emotional appeal that wins the day; reason follows humbly after. The film, with its forcible assault upon both eye and ear, is a powerful weapon of propaganda. And it could be used with effect for ‘putting across’ to the public the idea of preventive medicine. Perhaps the Minister of Health, [[Sir Kingsley Wood]], a master of propaganda, might enlist the help of the moving picture in his campaign for the improved health of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Papworth and Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3911 (Dec. 21, 1935), pp. 1213-1214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer==

By the 1980s, medical films had become an established vehicle of both medical and patient training. A 1987 issue of the [http://journals.lww.com/AJNOnline/pages/default.aspx American Journal of Nursing] contained a full-page section on Films &amp; Tapes covering broad topics such as Aids to Daily Living for the elderly, working moms, AIDS, alcohol abuse and even emotional fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Film listings. The American Journal of Nursing, Vol. 87, No. 12 (Dec., 1987), p. 1713&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer''' recognizes that film clips (with carefully crafted and verified content, and using graphics, animations and live-action video), can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people (patients, families, and friends), and healthcare professionals.

Traditionally the transfer of generic information (i.e. non patient-specific information) tends to happen on a somewhat ad-hoc, live, one-to-one basis, that is generally less well structured, less comprehensive, and thus less successful (whilst also being more expensive and less time efficient).

However, in order to be efficient and effective, the quality of the film’s content must be very high. A patient’s understanding of conditions and treatments is important to their care and well-being, so it is useful for carefully crafted clips to be available 24/7. It also helps patients when attending the all-important one-to-one consultations that are the bedrock of good healthcare. If patients are better informed and better prepared they can focus on their own case rather than generic issues.

The literature in this area also contains examples of what can happen when the film content is not particularly well crafted and presented. In 2000, a UK cancer study highlights the impact of poor quality video. The authors acknowledge that “not all [[Randomized controlled trials|randomised trials]] of video education, however, have had similarly consistent results. A randomised trial in patients undergoing [[colonoscopy]] reported increased knowledge and satisfaction but failed to demonstrate a reduction in anxiety. A similar study in patients receiving [[genetic counseling]] reported similar benefits but again no reduction in anxiety. Two further randomised trials, the first in patients having breast surgery and the second in patients undergoing [[coronary angioplasty]], failed to show any improvement in satisfaction or anxiety. The variation in these trial results suggests that, like all educational materials, the quality of the content is paramount and how it is used is vital to success. Involving patients in the development and showing patients recounting their personal experience undoubtedly helps. Using respected TV personalities offers the familiar face of respectability and professionalism. Above all, most studies fail to take advantage of the role which video has to play in continuing the educational process at home with their carers and friends, but instead ask patients to watch it in the unfamiliar environment of the clinic.” &lt;ref&gt;Thomas R et al. Forewarned is forearmed - benefits of preparatory information on video-cassette for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy - a randomised controlled trial. European Journal of cancer 36 (2000) 1536-1543).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the widespread use of the internet since the late 1990s, there is a tremendous potential for health-related films to be made available, free at the point of need, over the internet. Moreover, the 21st century sees an expanding integration of [[social media]] and [[mobile devices]] into our lives, thus enabling an even wider adoption of film-based health knowledge transfer.

==Case studies of healthcare knowledge transfer via cinematography==

A recent slate of long-form films includes ‘Outreach’ - a film about the workings of a specialist spinal injury unit, [http://www.spinalinjury.tv The Spinal Injury Patient Film], an award-winning film for new patients with spinal cord injuries, [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a Wheelchair], a film about the correct protocol of wheelchair assessment and procurement for individual patients, and several films on [[cancer survivorship]].

===[http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a wheelchair]: case study in the UK===

The 55 minute production is set to help improve well-being and long-term outcomes for Britain's 1.2 million wheelchair users. Too many people do not understand the importance of getting the right wheelchair; the right set-up and support, and the appropriate pressure relief.  UK provision is patchy, indeed there is - surprisingly - no qualification requirement for a wheelchair services provider/specifier in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

The [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com film] includes leading experts and practitioners in this area, plus case studies, and even an introductory history of the wheelchair. It thus provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of best practice and assessment, and is supported by many voices of experience.
For the NHS the long-term cost benefits of proper provision in an aging population are very considerable.

===[http://www.spinalinjury.tv Spinal injury patient film]===

Newly injured [[Spinal Cord Injury]] (SCI) patients are anxious about what is happening to them and the related long-term implications. When a patient is admitted to hospital with an SCI it is traumatic for their family, friends and loved ones too. One challenge faced by clinicians is communicating with a patient’s ‘advocates’, people who may know little of spinal cord injury, the care process, nor the problems of prognosis. They may be understandably overwhelmed, they want answers… “doctor, will he/she walk again?”.

Inspired by patient feedback, award-winning director [[Marcus Dillistone]], has created the film [http://www.spinalinjury.tv “From Darkness Into Light”], to help explain the core issues with SCI and to provide patient insight. The film is designed not to replace face-to-face discussion, but to complement it.

The [http://www.spinalinjury.tv film] was conceived as a ‘prescriptive’ communications tool in hospitals, with the decision of when (and if) to introduce the film to the patient or their advocates being made by the clinical team.

===Cancer survivorship films===

When a person is diagnosed with cancer, treatment is often the focus of discussion among patients, health care providers and family. However, the next phase of care, [[cancer survivorship]], is much less discussed. The 2005 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report “From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition” &lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine: From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation. 2005, National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; raised the awareness of the issue. Survivors of cancer face unique challenges, while health care providers do not always have the time, resource and training to provide counseling and assistance.

A 2005 randomized controlled study, Moving Beyond Cancer Trial,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, A. L., et al., Outcomes from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational, randomized controlled trial with breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol, 2005. 23(25): p. 6009-18.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a peer-modeling video as a psychoeducation tool is more effective than print materials in recovery of energy/vitality in post-treatment breast cancer patients. This 23-minute film, now available on the [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast/beyond-cancer-video National Cancer Institute website], addressed re-entry challenges in four life domains: physical health, emotional well-being, interpersonal relations, and life perspectives. Designed to promote adaptive peer modeling, the film observes four breast cancer survivors as they describe their experience in each of the four domains, as well as active coping skills they used to meet associated challenges. The film also includes commentary by an oncologist expert in breast cancer on the re-entry experience and on active methods for approaching problems during re-entry.

Since then, many video resources have been made available on the internet to cancer survivors and their care providers. Examples include a general education video on the issues of cancer survivorship produced by the IOM, a  video series by [[Living Beyond Breast Cancer]], a national education and support organization, addressing specific and sometimes sensitive issues during breast cancer survivorship.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=I Am a Young Woman With Breast Cancer|url=http://www.lbbc.org/Audiences/Young-Women/Let-s-Talk-About-It-Video-Series|website=Living Beyond Breast Cancer|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compressed sensing''' (also known as '''compressive sensing''', '''compressive sampling''', or '''sparse sampling''') is a [[signal processing]] technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], by finding solutions to [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined linear systems]]. This is based on the principle that, through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem]]. There are two conditions under which recovery is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2009/09/cs.html CS: Compressed Genotyping, DNA Sudoku - Harnessing high throughput sequencing for multiplexed specimen analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is [[sparsity]] which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is [[Coherence (signal processing)|incoherence]] which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donoho | first1 = David L | year = 2006 | title =  For most large underdetermined systems of linear equations the minimal 1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution| url = | journal = Communications on pure and applied mathematics | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 797–829 | doi = 10.1002/cpa.20132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainshark.com/brainshark/brainshark.net/portal/title.aspx?pid=zCdz10BfTRz0z0 M. Davenport, "The Fundamentals of Compressive Sensing", SigView, April 12, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A common goal of the engineering field of [[signal processing]] is to reconstruct a signal from a series of sampling measurements. In general, this task is impossible because there is no way to reconstruct a signal during the times that the signal is not measured. Nevertheless, with prior knowledge or assumptions about the signal, it turns out to be possible to perfectly reconstruct a signal from a series of measurements (acquiring this series of measurements is called [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]). Over time, engineers have improved their understanding of which assumptions are practical and how they can be generalized.

An early breakthrough in signal processing was the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]]. It states that if a [[Real number|real]] signal's highest frequency is less than half of the sampling rate (or less than the sampling rate, if the signal is [[Complex number|complex]]), then the signal can be reconstructed perfectly by means of [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula|sinc interpolation]]. The main idea is that with prior knowledge about constraints on the signal's frequencies, fewer samples are needed to reconstruct the signal.

Around 2004, [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]], [[Terence Tao]], and [[David Donoho]] proved that given knowledge about a signal's [[sparsity]], the signal may be reconstructed with even fewer samples than the sampling theorem requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cpa.20124|url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/StableRecovery.pdf|title=Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements|year=2006|last1=Candès|first1=Emmanuel J.|last2=Romberg|first2=Justin K.|last3=Tao|first3=Terence|journal=Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1207–1223|arxiv=math/0503066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donoho&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/TIT.2006.871582|title=Compressed sensing|year=2006|last1=Donoho|first1=D.L.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1289–1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is the basis of compressed sensing.

==History==
Compressed sensing relies on [[Lp space|L1]] techniques, which several other scientific fields have used historically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0ZCyAOBrUtA/TTwqLEeLvdI/AAAAAAAAEXI/7S0_SnWoC0E/s1600/l1-minimization.JPG List of L1 regularization ideas] from Vivek Goyal, Alyson Fletcher, Sundeep Rangan, [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/%7Elaugesen/imaha10/goyal_talk.pdf The Optimistic Bayesian: Replica Method Analysis of Compressed Sensing]&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, the [[least squares]] method was complemented by the [[Lp norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm]], which was introduced by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]. Following the introduction of [[linear programming]] and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]]'s [[simplex algorithm]], the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used in [[computational statistics]]. In statistical theory, the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used by [[George W. Brown (academic)|George W. Brown]] and later writers on [[median-unbiased estimator]]s. It was used by Peter J. Huber and others working on [[robust statistics]]. The &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was also used in signal processing, for example, in the 1970s, when seismologists constructed images of reflective layers within the earth based on data that did not seem to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist–Shannon criterion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1511/2009.79.276 |title = The Best Bits |year = 2009 |last1 = Hayes |first1 = Brian |journal = American Scientist |volume = 97 |issue = 4 |pages = 276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used in [[matching pursuit]] in 1993, the [[Lasso regression|LASSO estimator]] by [[Robert Tibshirani]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso.html |first = Robert |last = Tibshirani |title = Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso |journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]] |volume = 58 |issue = 1 |pages = 267–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[basis pursuit]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit", by Scott Shaobing Chen, David L. Donoho, Michael, A. Saunders. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt;  There were theoretical results describing when these algorithms recovered sparse solutions, but the required type and number of measurements were sub-optimal and subsequently greatly improved by compressed sensing.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

At first glance, compressed sensing might seem to violate [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|the sampling theorem]], because compressed sensing depends on the [[Sparse matrix|sparsity]] of the signal in question and not its highest frequency. This is a misconception, because the sampling theorem guarantees perfect reconstruction given sufficient, not necessary, conditions. A sampling method fundamentally different from classical fixed-rate sampling cannot "violate" the sampling theorem. Sparse signals with high frequency components can be highly under-sampled using compressed sensing compared to classical fixed-rate sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/ExactRecovery.pdf |title = Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction from Highly Incomplete Fourier Information |year = 2006 |last1 = Candès |first1 = Emmanuel J. |last2 = Romberg |first2 = Justin K. |last3 = Tao |first3 = Terence |journal = IEEE Trans.

==Method==

===Underdetermined linear system===
An [[underdetermined system]] of linear equations has more unknowns than equations and generally has an infinite number of solutions. The figure below shows such an equation system &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}=D\mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; where we want to find a solution for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Underdetermined equation system.svg|mini|200px|alt=Underdetermined linear equation system|Underdetermined linear equation system]]

In order to choose a solution to such a system, one must impose extra constraints or conditions (such as smoothness) as appropriate. In compressed sensing, one adds the constraint of sparsity, allowing only solutions which have a small number of nonzero coefficients. Not all underdetermined systems of linear equations have a sparse solution. However, if there is a unique sparse solution to the underdetermined system, then the compressed sensing framework allows the recovery of that solution.

===Solution / reconstruction method===
Compressed sensing takes advantage of the redundancy in many interesting signals—they are not pure noise. In particular, many signals are [[sparse matrix|sparse]], that is, they contain many coefficients close to or equal to zero, when represented in some domain.&lt;ref&gt;Candès, E.J., &amp; Wakin, M.B., ''An Introduction To Compressive Sampling'', IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, V.21, March 2008 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4472240&amp;isnumber=4472102]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same insight used in many forms of [[lossy compression]].

Compressed sensing typically starts with taking a weighted linear combination of samples also called compressive measurements in a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] different from the basis in which the signal is known to be sparse. The results found by  [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]],  [[Terence Tao]] and  [[David Donoho]], showed that the number of these compressive measurements can be small and still contain nearly all the useful information. Therefore, the task of converting the image back into the intended domain involves solving an underdetermined [[matrix equation]] since the number of compressive measurements taken is smaller than the number of pixels in the full image. However, adding the constraint that the initial signal is sparse enables one to solve this underdetermined [[system of linear equations]].

The least-squares solution to such problems is to minimize the [[L2 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm]]—that is, minimize the amount of energy in the system. This is usually simple mathematically (involving only a [[matrix multiplication]] by the [[pseudo-inverse]] of the basis sampled in). However, this leads to poor results for many practical applications, for which the unknown coefficients have nonzero energy.

To enforce the sparsity constraint when solving for the underdetermined system of linear equations, one can minimize the number of nonzero components of the solution. The function counting the number of non-zero components of a vector was called the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; "norm"]] by David Donoho{{refn|group=note|The quotation marks served two warnings.  First, the number-of-nonzeros &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt;-"norm" is not a proper [[F-space|F-norm]], because it is not continuous in its scalar argument: ''nnzs''(α''x'') is constant as α approaches zero. Unfortunately, authors now neglect the quotation marks and [[abuse of terminology|abused terminology]]—clashing with the established use of the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm for the space of measurable functions (equipped with an appropriate metric) or for the [[F-space|space]] of sequences with [[F-space|F–norm]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n) \mapsto \sum_n{2^{-n} x_n/(1+x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Rolewicz. ''Metric Linear Spaces''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

[[Emmanuel Candès|Candès]] et al. proved that for many problems it is probable that the [[L1 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm]] is equivalent to the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm]], in a technical sense: This equivalence result allows one to solve the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; problem, which is easier than the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; problem. Finding the candidate with the smallest &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm can be expressed relatively easily as a [[linear program]], for which efficient solution methods already exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.caltech.edu/l1magic/ L1-MAGIC is a collection of MATLAB routines]&lt;/ref&gt;  When measurements may contain a finite amount of noise, [[basis pursuit denoising]] is preferred over linear programming, since it preserves sparsity in the face of noise and can be solved faster than an exact linear program.

=== Total Variation based CS reconstruction ===
{{see also|Total variation denoising}}
{{split section|Total variation reconstruction|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- reason=Longest section in current article. --&gt;

==== Motivation and Applications ====

===== Role of TV regularization =====
[[Total variation]] can be seen as a [[non-negative]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] defined on the space of [[real number|real-valued]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s (for the case of functions of one variable) or on the space of [[integrable function]]s (for the case of functions of several variables). For signals, especially, [[total variation]] refers to the integral of the absolute [[gradient]] of the signal. In signal and image reconstruction, it is applied as [[total variation regularization]] where the underlying principle is that signals with excessive details have high total variation and that removing these details, while retaining important information such as edges, would reduce the total variation of the signal and make the signal subject closer to the original signal in the problem.

For the purpose of signal and image reconstruction, &lt;math&gt;l1&lt;/math&gt; minimization models are used. Other approaches also include the least-squares as has been discussed before in this article. These methods are extremely slow and return a not-so-perfect reconstruction of the signal. The current CS Regularization models attempt to address this problem by incorporating sparsity priors of the original image, one of which is the total variation (TV). Conventional TV approaches are designed to give piece-wise constant solutions. Some of these include (as discussed ahead) - constrained l1-minimization which uses an iterative scheme. This method, though fast, subsequently leads to over-smoothing of edges resulting in blurred image edges.&lt;ref name = "EPTV" /&gt; TV methods with iterative re-weighting have been implemented to reduce the influence of large gradient value magnitudes in the images. This has been used in [[Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT) reconstruction as a method known as edge-preserving total variation. However, as gradient magnitudes are used for estimation of relative penalty weights between the data fidelity and regularization terms, this method is not robust to noise and artifacts and accurate enough for CS image/signal reconstruction and, therefore, fails to preserve smaller structures.

Recent progress on this problem involves using an iteratively directional TV refinement for CS reconstruction.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; This method would have 2 stages: the first stage would estimate and refine the initial orientation field - which is defined as a noisy point-wise initial estimate, through edge-detection, of the given image. In the second stage, the CS reconstruction model is presented by utilizing directional TV regularizer. More details about these TV-based approaches - iteratively reweighted l1 minimization, edge-preserving TV and iterative model using directional orientation field and TV- are provided below.

[[File:IRLS.png|thumb|iteratively reweighted l1 minimization method for CS]]
In the CS reconstruction models using constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization, larger coefficients are penalized heavily in the &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; norm. It was proposed to have a weighted formulation of &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization designed to more democratically penalize nonzero coefficients. An iterative algorithm is used for constructing the appropriate weights.&lt;ref name="Iteration"&gt;Lange, K.: Optimization, Springer Texts in Statistics. Springer, New York (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Each iteration requires solving one &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization problem by finding the local minimum of a concave penalty function that more closely resembles the &lt;math&gt;l_{0}&lt;/math&gt; norm. An additional parameter, usually to avoid any sharp transitions in the penalty function curve, is introduced into the iterative equation to ensure stability and so that a zero estimate in one iteration does not necessarily lead to a zero estimate in the next iteration. The method essentially involves using the current solution for computing the weights to be used in the next iteration.

====== Advantages and disadvantages ======
Early iterations may find inaccurate sample estimates, however this method will down-sample these at a later stage to give more weight to the smaller non-zero signal estimates. One of the disadvantages is the need for defining a valid starting point as a global minimum might not be obtained every time due to the concavity of the function. Another disadvantage is that this method tends to uniformly penalize the image gradient irrespective of the underlying image structures. This causes over-smoothing of edges, especially those of low contrast regions, subsequently leading to loss of low contrast information. The advantages of this method include: reduction of the sampling rate for sparse signals; reconstruction of the image while being robust to the removal of noise and other artifacts; and use of very few iterations. This can also help in recovering images with sparse gradients.

In the figure shown below, '''P1''' refers to the first-step of the iterative reconstruction process, of the projection matrix '''P''' of the fan-beam geometry, which is constrained by the data fidelity term. This may contain noise and artifacts as no regularization is performed. The minimization of '''P1''' is solved through the conjugate gradient least squares method. '''P2''' refers to the second step of the iterative reconstruction process wherein it utilizes the edge-preserving total variation regularization term to remove noise and artifacts, and thus improve the quality of the reconstructed image/signal. The minimization of '''P2''' is done through a simple gradient descent method. Convergence is determined by testing, after each iteration, for image positivity, by checking if &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the case when &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (Note that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; refers to the different x-ray linear attenuation coefficients at different voxels of the patient image).

[[File:Edge preserving TV.png|thumb|Flow diagram figure for edge preserving total variation method for compressed sensing]]
This is an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving TV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data obtained at low dose CT through low current levels (milliampere).  In order to reduce  the imaging dose, one of the approaches used is to reduce the number of x-ray projections acquired by the scanner detectors. However, this insufficient projection data which is used to reconstruct the CT image can cause streaking artifacts. Furthermore, using these insufficient projections in standard TV algorithms end up making the problem under-determined and thus leading to infinitely many possible solutions. In this method, an additional penalty weighted function is assigned to the original TV norm. This allows for easier detection of sharp discontinuities in intensity in the images and thereby adapt the weight to store the recovered edge information during the process of signal/image reconstruction. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; controls the amount of smoothing applied to the pixels at the edges to differentiate them from the non-edge pixels. The value of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is changed adaptively based on the values of the histogram of the gradient magnitude so that a certain percentage of pixels have gradient values larger than &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The edge-preserving total variation term, thus, becomes sparser and this speeds up the implementation. A two-step iteration process known as forward-backward splitting algorithm is used.&lt;ref name = "Forward-Backward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combettes | first1 = P | last2 = Wajs | first2 = V | year = 2005 | title = Signal recovery by proximal forward-backward splitting | url = | journal = Multiscale Model Simul | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1168–200 | doi=10.1137/050626090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization problem is split into two sub-problems which are then solved with the conjugate gradient least squares method&lt;ref name="CGLS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hestenes | first1 = M | last2 = Stiefel | first2 = E | year = 1952 | title = Methods of conjugate gradients for solving linear systems | url = | journal = J Res Natl Bur Stand | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 409–36 | doi=10.6028/jres.049.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the simple gradient descent method respectively. The method is stopped when the desired convergence has been achieved or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.

===== Advantages and disadvantages =====
Some of the disadvantages of this method are the absence of smaller structures in the reconstructed image and degradation of image resolution. This edge preserving TV algorithm, however, requires fewer iterations than the conventional TV algorithm.&lt;ref name ="EPTV" /&gt; Analyzing the horizontal and vertical intensity profiles of the reconstructed images, it can be seen that there are sharp jumps at edge points and negligible, minor fluctuation at non-edge points. Thus, this method leads to low relative error and higher correlation as compared to the TV method. It also effectively suppresses and removes any form of image noise and image artifacts such as streaking.

=====Iterative model using a directional orientation field and directional total variation&lt;ref name="Orientation and directional refinement"&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6588871&lt;/ref&gt;=====
To prevent over-smoothing of edges and texture details and to obtain a reconstructed CS image which is accurate and robust to noise and artifacts, this method is used. First, an initial estimate of the noisy point-wise orientation field of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained. This noisy orientation field is defined so that it can be refined at a later stage to reduce the noise influences in orientation field estimation.A coarse orientation field estimation is then introduced based on structure tensor which is formulated as:&lt;ref name="Structure tensor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brox | first1 = T. | last2 = Weickert | first2 = J. | last3 = Burgeth | first3 = B. | last4 = Mrázek | first4 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Nonlinear structure tensors | url = | journal = Image Vis. Comput | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 41–55 | doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2005.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt; J_\rho(\nabla I_{\sigma}) = G_\rho * (\nabla I_{\sigma} \otimes \nabla I_{\sigma}) = \begin{pmatrix}J_{11} &amp; J_{12}\\J_{12} &amp; J_{22}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt; J_\rho &lt;/math&gt; refers to the structure tensor related with the image pixel point (i,j) having standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; refers to the Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;(0, \rho ^2)&lt;/math&gt; with standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; refers to the manually defined parameter for the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; below which the edge detection is insensitive to noise. &lt;math&gt;\nabla I_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the gradient of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I_{\sigma} \otimes \nabla I_{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt; refers to the tensor product obtained by using this gradient.

The structure tensor obtained is convolved with a Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to improve the accuracy of the orientation estimate with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; being set to high values to account for the unknown noise levels. For every pixel (i,j) in the image, the structure tensor J is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix. Convolving all the pixels in the image with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, gives orthonormal eigen vectors  ω and υ of the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; matrix. ω points in the direction of the dominant orientation having the largest contrast and υ points in the direction of the structure orientation having the smallest contrast.  The orientation field coarse initial estimation &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; = υ.  This estimate is accurate at strong edges. However, at weak edges or on regions with noise, its reliability decreases.

To overcome this drawback, a refined orientation model is defined in which the data term reduces the effect of noise and improves accuracy while the second penalty term with the L2-norm is a fidelity term which ensures accuracy of initial coarse estimation.

This orientation field is introduced into the directional total variation optimization model for CS reconstruction through the equation: &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; is the objective signal which needs to be recovered. Y is the corresponding measurement vector, d is the iterative refined orientation field and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the CS measurement matrix. This method undergoes a few iterations ultimately leading to convergence.&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the orientation field approximate estimation of the reconstructed image &lt;math&gt;X^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; from the previous iteration (in order to check for convergence and the subsequent optical performance, the previous iteration is used). For the two vector fields represented by  &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Chi \bullet d&lt;/math&gt; refers to the multiplication of respective horizontal and vertical vector elements of &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; followed by their subsequent addition. These equations are reduced to a series of convex minimization problems which are then solved with a combination of variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (FFT-based fast solver with a closed form solution) methods.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; It (Augmented Lagrangian) is considered equivalent to the split Bregman iteration which ensures convergence of this method.  The orientation field, d is defined as being equal to &lt;math&gt;(d_{h}, d_{v})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_{h},  d_{v}&lt;/math&gt; define the horizontal and vertical estimates of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Augmented Lagrangian.png|thumb|right|Augmented Lagrangian method for orientation field and iterative directional field refinement models]]

The Augmented Lagrangian method for the orientation field,  &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  involves initializing &lt;math&gt;d_{h}, d_{v}, H, V&lt;/math&gt; and then finding the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to these variables.  The Lagrangian multipliers are then updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved. For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the augmented lagrangian method involves initializing &lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="TV"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldluecke | first1 = B. | last2 = Strekalovskiy | first2 = E. | last3 = Cremers | first3 = D. | last4 = Siims | first4 = P.-T.

Imag Sci | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 537–563 | doi=10.1137/110823766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt; are newly introduced variables where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{h}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla \Chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;P \bullet d&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{H}, \lambda_{V}, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrangian multipliers for &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;. For each iteration, the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to variables (&lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated. And as in the field refinement model, the lagrangian multipliers are updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved.

For the orientation field refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated in the iterative process as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{H})^k = (\lambda_{H})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{H}(H^k - \nabla (d_{h})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{V})^k = (\lambda_{V})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{V}(V^k - \nabla (d_{v})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{P})^k = (\lambda_{P})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{P}(P^k - \nabla (\Chi)^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{Q})^k = (\lambda_{Q})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{Q}(Q^k - P^{k} \bullet d)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{H}, \gamma_{V}, \gamma_{P}, \gamma_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

=====Advantages and disadvantages=====

Based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) metrics and known ground-truth images for testing performance, it is concluded that iterative directional total variation has a better reconstructed performance than the non-iterative methods in preserving edge and texture areas. The orientation field refinement model plays a major role in this improvement in performance as it increases the number of directionless pixels in the flat area while enhancing the orientation field consistency in the regions with edges.

==Applications==
The field of compressive sensing is related to several topics in signal processing and computational mathematics, such as [[underdetermined system|underdetermined linear-system]]s, [[group testing]], heavy hitters, [[sparse coding]], [[multiplexing]], sparse sampling, and finite rate of innovation. Its broad scope and generality has enabled several innovative CS-enhanced approaches in signal processing and compression, solution of inverse problems, design of radiating systems, radar and through-the-wall imaging, and antenna characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Andrea Massa |author2=Paolo Rocca |author3=Giacomo Oliveri |title = Compressive Sensing in Electromagnetics - A Review|journal = IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume = 57|number = 1|year = 2015|pp = 224–238|doi = 10.1109/MAP.2015.2397092|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7046378|bibcode=2015IAPM...57..224M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imaging techniques having a strong affinity with compressive sensing include [[coded aperture]] and [[computational photography]]. Implementations of compressive sensing in hardware at different [[technology readiness level]]s is available.&lt;ref&gt;Compressive Sensing Hardware, http://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/compressedsensinghardware&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional CS reconstruction uses sparse signals (usually sampled at a rate less than the Nyquist sampling rate) for reconstruction through constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization. One of the earliest applications of such an approach was in reflection seismology which used sparse reflected signals from band-limited data for tracking changes between sub-surface layers.&lt;ref name="Seismic sparse signals"&gt;Taylor, H.L., Banks, S.C., McCoy, J.F. "Deconvolution with the 1 norm. ''Geophysics'' 44(1), 39–52 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  When the LASSO model came into prominence in the 1990s as a statistical method for selection of sparse models,&lt;ref name="LASSO"&gt;Tibshirani, R. "Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. ''J. R. Stat. Soc. B'' 58(1), 267–288 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; this method was further used in computational harmonic analysis for sparse signal representation from over-complete dictionaries. Some of the other applications include incoherent sampling of radar pulses. The work by ''Boyd et al.''&lt;ref name = "Original source for IRLS" /&gt; has applied the LASSO model- for selection of sparse models- towards analog to digital converters (the current ones use a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate along with the quantized Shannon representation). This would involve a parallel architecture in which the polarity of the analog signal changes at a high rate followed by digitizing the integral at the end of each time-interval to obtain the converted digital signal.

Compressed sensing is used in a mobile phone camera sensor. The approach allows a reduction in image acquisition energy per image by as much as a factor of 15 at the cost of complex decompression algorithms; the computation may require an off-device implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Camera Chip Captures Only What It Needs|author=David Schneider|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=March 2013|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/camera-chip-makes-alreadycompressed-images|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed sensing addresses the issue of high scan time by enabling faster acquisition by measuring fewer Fourier coefficients. This produces a high-quality image with relatively lower scan time. Another application (also discussed ahead) is for CT reconstruction with fewer X-ray projections. Compressed sensing, in this case, removes the high spatial gradient parts - mainly, image noise and artifacts. This holds tremendous potential as one can obtain high-resolution CT images at low radiation doses (through lower current-mA settings).&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = M. | last2 = Bioucas-Dias | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = R.D. | year = 2007 | title = Majorization–minimization algorithms for wavelet-based image restoration | url = | journal = IEEE Trans.

===Network tomography===
Compressed sensing has showed outstanding results in the application of [[network tomography]] to [[network management]]. [[Network delay]] estimation and [[network congestion]] detection can both be modeled as underdetermined [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] where the coefficient matrix is the network routing matrix. Moreover, in the [[Internet]], network routing matrices usually satisfy the criterion for using compressed sensing.&lt;ref&gt;[Network tomography via compressed sensing|http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/funlab/Publications/2010/CS-Tomo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave-infrared cameras===
Commercial shortwave-infrared cameras based upon compressed sensing are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InView web site|url=http://www.inviewcorp.com/products |website=inviewcorp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras have light sensitivity from 0.9&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] to 1.7&amp;nbsp;µm, which are wavelengths invisible to the human eye.

===Aperture synthesis in radio astronomy===
In the field of [[radio astronomy]], compressed sensing has been proposed for deconvolving an interferometric image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/395/3/1733|Compressed sensing imaging techniques for radio interferometry]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[CLEAN (algorithm)|Högbom CLEAN algorithm]] that has been in use for the deconvolution of radio images since 1974, is similar to compressed sensing's matching pursuit algorithm.

===Transmission electron microscopy===
Compressed sensing combined with a moving aperture has been used to increase the acquisition rate of images in a [[transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Andrew|last2=Kovarik|first2=Libor|last3=Abellan|first3=Patricia|last4=Yuan|first4=Xin|last5=Carin|first5=Lawrence|last6=Browning|first6=Nigel D.|title=Applying compressive sensing to TEM video: a substantial frame rate increase on any camera|journal=Advanced Structural and Chemical Imaging|date=13 August 2015|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s40679-015-0009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scanning transmission electron microscopy|scanning mode]], compressive sensing combined with random scanning of the electron beam has enabled both faster acquisition and less electron dose, which allows for imaging of electron beam sensitive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovarik|first1=L.|last2=Stevens|first2=A.|last3=Liyu|first3=A.|last4=Browning|first4=N.

The '''cosmic age problem''' is a historical problem in astronomy concerning the [[age of the universe]]. The problem was that at various times in the 20th century, some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=Evidence&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#oldstars Evidence for the Big Bang] by Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton. January 25, 2006. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the [[Hubble constant]], denoted H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (This is more correctly called the Hubble parameter, since it generally varies with time).
If so, this would represent a contradiction, since objects such as galaxies, stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the Big Bang.

Since around 1997–2003, the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists: modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the [[age of the universe]] (i.e. time since the Big Bang) of 13.8 billion years, and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this, or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties.

== Early years ==

Following theoretical developments of the [[Friedmann equations]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1920s, and the discovery of the expanding universe by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a finite time in the past. This concept, initially known as the "Primeval Atom" by Lemaitre, was later elaborated into the modern [[Big Bang]] theory. If the universe had expanded at a constant rate in the past, the age of the universe now (i.e. the time since the Big Bang) is simply the inverse of the Hubble constant, often known as the ''Hubble time''. For Big Bang models with zero [[cosmological constant]] and positive matter density, the actual age must be somewhat younger than this Hubble time; typically the age would be between 66% and 90% of the Hubble time, depending on the density of matter.

Hubble's early estimate of his constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubble|first1=E.|title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 1929|volume=15|issue=3|pages=168–173|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|pmid=16577160|pmc=522427|bibcode = 1929PNAS...15..168H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, and the inverse of that is 1.8 billion years. It was believed by many geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] in the 1920s that the Earth was probably over 2 billion years old, but with large uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The possible discrepancy between the ages of the Earth and the universe was probably one motivation for the development of the [[Steady State theory]] in 1948 as an alternative to the Big Bang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kragh|first1=Helge|title=Cosmology and Controversy|date=1999|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the (now obsolete) steady state theory, the universe is infinitely old and on average unchanging with time. The steady state theory postulated spontaneous creation of matter to keep the average density constant as the universe expands, and therefore most galaxies still have an age less than 1/H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; had been 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, our Milky Way galaxy would be exceptionally large compared to most other galaxies, so it could well be much older than an average galaxy, therefore eliminating the age problem.

== 1950–1970 ==

In the 1950s, two substantial errors were discovered in Hubble's extragalactic distance scale: first in 1952, [[Walter Baade]] discovered there were two classes of [[Cepheid]] variable star. Hubble's sample comprised different classes nearby and in other galaxies, and correcting this error made all other galaxies twice as distant as Hubble's values, thus doubling the Hubble time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation of the Cepheids|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=February 1956|volume=68|issue=400|pages=5|doi=10.1086/126870|bibcode = 1956PASP...68....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second error was discovered by [[Allan Sandage]] and coworkers: for galaxies beyond the [[Local Group]], Cepheids were too faint to observe with Hubble's instruments, so Hubble used the brightest stars as distance indicators. Many of Hubble's "brightest stars" were actually HII regions or clusters containing many stars, which caused another underestimation of distances for these more distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Humason |first1=M. L. |last2=Mayall |first2=N. U. |last3=Sandage |first3=A. R. |title=Redshifts and magnitudes of extragalactic nebulae |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=April 1956 |volume=61 |page=97 |doi=10.1086/107297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1958 Sandage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandage|first=Allan|title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1958|volume=127|page=513|doi=10.1086/146483|bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published the first reasonably accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, at 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, which is close to modern estimates of 68–74&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=A.|title=A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble constant with the Hubble Space Telescope|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=730|issue=119|pages=119|arxiv=1103.2976|last2=Macri|first2=Lucas|last3=Casertano|first3=Stefano|last4=Lampeitl|first4=Hubert|last5= Ferguson|first5=Henry C.|last6= Filippenko|first6=Alexei V.|last7= Jha|first7=Saurabh W.|last8=Li|first8=Weidong|last9=Chornock|first9=Ryan|year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...730..119R |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the Earth (actually the Solar System) was first accurately measured around 1955 by [[Clair Patterson]] at 4.55 billion years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=C.|last2=Tilton|first2=G.|last3=Inghram|first3=M.|title=Age of the Earth|journal=Science|date=21 January 1955|volume=121|issue=3134|pages=69–75|doi=10.1126/science.121.3134.69|pmid=17782556|bibcode = 1955Sci...121...69P }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to the modern value. For H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, the inverse of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 13.0 billion years; so after 1958 the Big Bang model age was comfortably older than the Earth.

However, in the 1960s and onwards, new developments in the theory of stellar evolution enabled age estimates for large star clusters called [[globular clusters]]: these generally gave age estimates of around 15 billion years, with substantial scatter.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Further revisions of the Hubble constant by Sandage and [[Gustav Tammann]] in the 1970s gave values around 50–60&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=A.|last2=Tammann|first2=G. A.|title=Steps toward the Hubble constant. VII - Distances to NGC 2403, M101, and the Virgo cluster using 21 centimeter line widths compared with optical methods: The global value of H sub 0|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=210|pages=7|doi=10.1086/154798|bibcode=1976ApJ...210....7S|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inverse of 16-20 billion years, consistent with globular cluster ages.

== 1975–1990 ==

However, in the late 1970s to early 1990s, the age problem re-appeared: new estimates of the Hubble constant gave higher values, with [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]] estimating values 90–100&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=G.|title=Five crucial tests of the cosmic distance scale using the Galaxy as fundamental standard|journal=Nature|date=23 September 1982|volume=299|issue=5881|pages=303–307|doi=10.1038/299303a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.299..303D }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Marc Aaronson]] and co-workers gave values around 80-90 &amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=M.|last2=Bothun|first2=G.|last3=Mould|first3=J.|last4=Huchra|first4=J.|last5=Schommer|first5=R.

== Late 1990s: probable solution ==

The age problem was eventually thought to be resolved by several developments between 1995-2003: firstly, a large program with the [[Hubble space telescope]] measured the Hubble constant at 72&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc with 10 percent uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madore|first1=Barry F.|last2=Freedman|first2=Wendy  L.|last3=Silbermann|first3=N.|last4=Harding|first4=Paul|last5=Huchra|first5=John|last6=Mould|first6=Jeremy R.|last7=Graham|first7=John A.|last8=Ferrarese|first8=Laura|last9=Gibson|first9=Brad K.|last10=Han|first10=Mingsheng|last11=Hoessel|first11=John G.|last12=Hughes|first12=Shaun M.|last13=Illingworth|first13=Garth D.|last14=Phelps|first14=Randy|last15=Sakai|first15=Shoko|last16=Stetson|first16=Peter|title=The Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.

The presence of dark energy implies that the universe was expanding more slowly at around half its present age than today, which makes the universe older for a given value of the Hubble constant.  The combination of the three results above essentially removed the discrepancy between estimated globular cluster ages and the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krauss, Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian |title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology |journal=Science |date=3 January 2003 |volume=299 |issue=5603 |pages=65&amp;ndash;69 |bibcode=2003Sci...299...65K |doi=10.1126/science.1075631 |pmid=12511641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent measurements from [[WMAP]] and the [[Planck spacecraft]] lead to an estimate of the [[age of the universe]] of 13.80 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Planck Collaboration|title=Planck 2013 results XVI: Cosmological Parameters|arxiv=1303.5076|first1=Planck|last2= Ade|first2=P.

A '''''determinatio''''' is an authoritative determination by the legislator concerning the application of practical principles, that is not necessitated by deduction from natural&lt;ref name=Finnis&gt;Finnis, John. ''Aquinas'', 266-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  or divine law&lt;ref name=Hervada33&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; but is based on the contingencies of practical judgement within the possibilities allowed by reason.&lt;ref name="Finnis"/&gt;

In [[natural law]] jurisprudence, ''determinatio'' is the process of making natural law into positive law&lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722308 ''Torture, Suicide, and Determinatio'' main page], Social Science Research Network. Accessed 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], ''determinatio'' is the act by which natural law or divine positive law is made determinate in the canonical legal system as specific norms of law,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; although the content of such law is still essentially that of divine law, which, together with canon law, forms "a single juridical system of law".&lt;ref name=Hervada34&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept derives from the [[legal philosophy]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-law-theories/#PurPosLawDetTheLegMorAutForCitJudFacMadReaForAct Natural Law Theories], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be a part of discussions in natural law theory.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

''Determinatio'' is a legal doctrine in the jurisprudence of the canon law of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; It was imported from the legal philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34 (citing ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm#article3 Ia-IIæ q.95 a.3])&lt;/ref&gt;

The general norms of divine or natural law serve as "shaping factors"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and "a necessary basis"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; for the human-made canon law, but such general norms in themselves cannot have a greater legal effect until they are made into specific human laws, since the norms of divine law are "general and non-specific".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

But in the movement from the general to the concrete, there are sometimes many possibilities;&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; that is, divine or natural law can be made concrete in may different ways,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and all the legitimate alternatives are in line with the requirements of divine law.&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; Wherefore the legislator must make a ''determinatio'' and "opt or choose among them".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

The '''Dioxin Reassessment Report''' refers to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s scientific reassessment of the health effects of exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]]. It began in April 1991, and in 1994 was published for public review. In 1995 the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed it, concluding that three chapters (eight, nine and a new chapter) be subject to independent peer review. This involved a 2003 review of the reassessment by the Interagency Working Group on Dioxin (Dioxin IWG), who recommended a further review by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS). This review by the NAS began in November 2004, and was expected to end by June 2006. As of 2012, the review is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/CFM/nceaQFind.cfm?keyword=Dioxin EPA Environmental Assessment: Dioxin] Retrieved 2012-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moana_tatoo.jpg|thumb|[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]], by Robert Flaherty, the first docufiction in film history (1926)]]

'''Docufiction''' (or '''docu-fiction'''), often confused with [[docudrama]], is the cinematographic combination of [[documentary film|documentary]] and [[fiction]], this term often meaning [[narrative film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://girishshambu.blogspot.com/2006/12/six-types-of-documentary.html Reality and documentary] – at Six Types Of Documentary, article by Girish Shambu (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[film genre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html An Introduction to Genre Theory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185337/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre7.html |date=November 18, 2011 }} by [[Daniel Chandler]] at [http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ Aberystwyth University]&lt;/ref&gt; which attempts to capture reality such as it is (as [[direct cinema]] or [[cinéma vérité]]) and which simultaneously introduces unreal elements or fictional situations in [[narrative]] in order to strengthen the representation of reality using some kind of [[artistic expression]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.videomaker.com/article/c06/18290-a-creative-treatment-of-actuality A creative treatment of actuality] – article by Peter Biesterfeld at [https://www.videomaker.com/ Videomaker], 08/07/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, it is a documentary mixed with fictional elements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesionline.it/default/tesi.asp?idt=18073 Il difficile rapporto tra fiction e non fiction che si concretizza nella docu-fiction] (The difficult relationship between fiction and non-fiction patent in docufiction) – thesis in Italian by Laura Marchesi, Faculty of Communication Sciences (Università degli Studi di Pavia) at [http://www.tesionline.it/default/index.asp Tesionline], 2005/06&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Real time (media)|real time]], filmed when the events take place, and in which the main [[character (arts)|character]] or characters — often portrayed by non-professional or amateur actors — are essentially playing themselves, or slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, in a fictionalized scenario. In this sense, docufiction may overlap to an extent with some aspects of the [[mockumentary]] format, but the terms are not synonymous.

A film genre in expansion, it is adopted by a number of [[experimental]] filmmakers.

The [[neologism]] docufiction&lt;ref&gt;What is docufiction? – See [http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf Section II, pages 37 to 75 (four chapters)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911104733/http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf |date=September 11, 2011 }} of the thesis by Prof. Theo Mäusli&lt;/ref&gt; appeared at the beginning of the 21st century.

==Origins==
The term involves a way of making films already practiced by such authors as [[Robert Flaherty]], one of the fathers of documentary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma01/huffman/frontier/define.html Definition of documentary – New Frontiers in American documentary] (American Studies at The University of Virginia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html The Impulse of Documentary-Fiction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319052930/http://www.transartinstitute.org/Example_Papers.html |date=March 19, 2012 }} – Paper at [http://www.transartinstitute.org/About.html Transart Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101542/http://transartinstitute.org/About.html |date=2011-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Rouch]], later in the 20th century.

Being both [[fiction]] and [[documentary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avila.edu/journal/fall03/StonePaper.htm (NON)FICTION AND THE VIEWER: RE-INTERPRETING THE DOCUMENTARY FILM] – Paper by Tammy Stone, [http://www.avila.edu/ Avila University]&lt;/ref&gt; docufiction is a [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] genre,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf hybrid genre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911104733/http://www.bul.unisi.ch/cerca/bul/memorie/com/pdf/9900Candeloro.pdf |date=September 11, 2011 }} – page 50, thesis on docufiction by Prof. Theo Mäusli&lt;/ref&gt; raising [[ethical]] problems&lt;ref name="latineos1"&gt;[http://latineos.com/en/articles/popular-culture/item/84-open-ended-realities.html Open-ended Realities] – article by Luciana Lang at [http://latineos.com/ Latineos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/french_forum/v035/35.2-3.loftus.pdf The appeal of hybrid documentary forms in West Africa] at [http://muse.jhu.edu/ Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707064104/http://centerforsocialmedia.wikispaces.com/message/view/Ethical+Practices/90224 Ethics and Documentary Filmmaking] – Article by [[Marty Lucas]] at [https://archive.is/20120711010041/http://futureofpublicmedia.wikispaces.com/home Center for Social Media] (American University in Washington, D.C)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communication.usf.edu/faculty/butchart/ethics-documentary.pdf On Ethics and Documentary: A Real and Actual Truth] – Article by [[Garnet C.

In the domain of [[visual anthropology]], the innovating role of Jean Rouch&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rouge.com.au/3/rouch_valediction.html Jean Rouch 1917-2004, A Valediction] – Article by [[Michael Eaton]] at [http://www.rouge.com.au/ Rouge]&lt;/ref&gt; allows one to consider him as the father of a subgenre called [[ethnofiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary] at MAITRES_FOUS.NET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction, thesis by Brian Quist, Long Island University&lt;/ref&gt; This term means: [[ethnographic]] documentary film with natives who play fictional roles. Making them play a role about themselves will help portray reality, which&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnofiction: drama as a creative research practice in ethnographic film." Journal of Media Practice 9, no. 3(2008), eScholarID:1b5648, article by Johannes Sjöberg&lt;/ref&gt; will be reinforced with [[imagery]]. A non-ethnographic [[documentary]] with fictional elements uses the same method and, for the same reasons, may be called docufiction.

==Docudrama and mockumentary==
In contrast, [[docudrama]] is usually a fictional and dramatized recreation&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.sadibey.com/dosyalar/Gerekli_Seyler/Documentary_Genres.doc Docudrama: the real (his)tory Confusion of genres] – Page 2 on the thesis by Çiçek Coşkun (New York University School of Education)&lt;/ref&gt; of factual events in form of a documentary, at a time subsequent to the "real" events it portrays. A docudrama is often confused with ''docufiction'' when [[drama]] is considered interchangeable with [[fiction]] (both words meaning the same). However, "docudrama" refers specifically to [[Television film|telefilms]] or other television media recreations that dramatize certain events often with [[actor]]s.
 	
A [[mockumentary]] is also a film or television show in which fictitious events are presented in documentary format, sometimes a recreation of factual events after they took place or a comment on [[current events]], typically satirical, comedic or even dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;A television programme or film which takes the form of a serious documentary in order to satirize its subject. – definition at The Free Dictionary and Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas mockumentaries are usually fully scripted comedies or dramas that merely adopt some aspects of documentary format as a framing device, docufictions are usually not scripted, instead placing the participants in a fictionalized scenario while portraying their own genuine reactions and their own [[improvisation]]al dialogue and character development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3138">'''EuroNanoForum 2009''' was the fourth conference in a set of [[Europe]]an [[nanotechnology]] conferences organized within the framework of national presidencies and promoted by DG research, Directorate G.

==Previous Conferences==

The EuroNanoForum 2009 conference built up on the success of EuroNanoForum 2003, EuroNanoForum 2005 and EuronanoForum 2007 and addressed “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce [[pollution]], conserve resources and, ultimately, build a "clean" environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology.

The EuroNanoForum 2009 was organized as a four-day conference taking place from June 2–5, 2009 at [[Prague]] Conference Centre (CCP) within the frame of the Czech presidency, which ran from January to June 2009. The conference was conceived as an accompanying event of the presidency, under the auspices of the Czech Ministry for Education Youth and Sports (MEYS) as a support action of NMP programme of FP7. The EuroNanoForum 2009 focused on the “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy” exploring environmental as well as societal impact of the industrial applications of nanotechnology. This issue involves not only very broad and diverse areas of nanotechnology R&amp;D such as nanomaterials, nanoelectronics and [[photonics]], and bionanotechnologies but also energetics, [[environmental engineering]], [[toxicology]] and even [[climatology]]. This created a unique opportunity for researches and industrial experts coming from diverse fields of science and technology to meet each other and get involved in inspiring and fruitful dialogue or start cross-fertilising collaboration.

A '''feedwater heater''' is a [[power plant]] component used to pre-heat water delivered to a [[steam]] generating [[boiler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British Electricity International|title=Modern Power Station Practice: incorporating modern power system practice|edition=3rd Edition (12 volume set)|publisher=Pergamon|year=1991|isbn=0-08-040510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the [[thermodynamic efficiency]] of the system.&lt;ref name=Weston&gt;[http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~kenneth-weston/chapter2.pdf Fundamentals of Steam Power] by Kenneth Weston, [[University of Tulsa]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid [[thermal shock]] to the boiler metal when the feedwater is introduced back into the steam cycle.

In a steam power plant (usually modeled as a modified [[Rankine cycle]]), feedwater heaters allow the feedwater to be brought up to the saturation temperature very gradually.  This minimizes the inevitable irreversibilities associated with heat transfer to the working fluid (water). See the article on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for a further discussion of such [[Irreversible process|irreversibilities]].

==Cycle discussion and explanation ==

The energy used to heat the feedwater is usually derived from steam extracted between the stages of the [[steam turbine]].  Therefore, the steam that ''would be used'' to perform expansion work in the turbine (and therefore generate power) is not utilized for that purpose. The percentage of the total cycle steam mass flow used for the  feedwater heater is termed the [[extraction fraction]]&lt;ref name=Weston/&gt; and must be carefully optimized for maximum power plant [[thermal efficiency]] since increasing this fraction causes a decrease in turbine power output.

Feedwater heaters can also be  ''"open"'' or ''"closed"'' &amp;thinsp;[[heat exchanger]]s. An open heat exchanger is one in which extracted steam is allowed to mix with the feedwater. This kind of heater will normally require a feed pump at both the feed inlet and outlet since the pressure in the heater is between the boiler pressure and the [[Surface condenser|condenser]] pressure. A [[deaerator]] is a special case of the open feedwater heater which is specifically designed to remove non-condensable gases from the feedwater.

Closed feedwater heaters are typically [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s where the feedwater passes throughout the tubes and is heated by turbine extraction steam. These do not require separate pumps before and after the heater to boost the feedwater to the pressure of the extracted steam as with an open heater. However, the extracted steam (which is most likely almost fully condensed after heating the feedwater) must then be throttled to the condenser pressure, an [[isenthalpic]] process that results in some [[entropy]] gain with a slight penalty on overall cycle efficiency:

Many power plants incorporate a number of feedwater heaters and may use both open and closed components. Feedwater heaters are used in both fossil- and nuclear-fueled power plants.

==Economizer==
{{main|Economizer}}
An economizer serves a similar purpose to a feedwater heater, but is technically different as it does not use cycle steam for heating. In fossil-fuel plants, the economizer uses the lowest-temperature [[flue gas]] from the [[furnace]] to heat the water before it enters the boiler proper. This allows for the heat transfer between the furnace and the feedwater to occur across a smaller average temperature gradient (for the steam generator as a whole). System efficiency is therefore further increased when viewed with respect to actual energy content of the fuel. 

Most nuclear power plants do not have an economizer. However, the Combustion Engineering [[System 80]]+ nuclear plant design and its evolutionary successors, (e.g. [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]]'s [[APR-1400]]) incorporate an integral feedwater economizer. This economizer preheats the steam generator feedwater at the steam generator inlet using the lowest-temperature primary coolant.

==Testing==

A widely use Code for the procedures, direction, and guidance for determining the thermo-hydraulic performance of a closed feedwater heater is the ASME PTC 12.1 Feedwater Heater Standard.

The '''French National School of Forestry''' (''École nationale des eaux et forêts'', or National School of Water Resources and Forestry), established in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]], in 1824, was the first national training institute for [[foresters]] in France, and a premier early school of forestry in Europe and globally.

In 1964, it was merged into the National School of Rural Engineering, Water Resources and Forestry (''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'', or ENGREF), which in turn became part of [[AgroParisTech]] (''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l’environnement'', or Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences) in 2006.

'''Genetics''' is a branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of [[gene]]s, [[genetic variation]], and [[heredity]] in living [[organism]]s.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect60&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J.

[[Gregor Mendel]], a scientist and [[Augustinian]] [[friar]], discovered genetics in the late 19th-century. Mendel studied "trait inheritance", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete "units of inheritance". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a [[gene]].

[[Phenotypic trait|Trait]] inheritance and [[Molecular genetics|molecular]] inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the organism (e.g. [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]]), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including [[epigenetics]] and [[population genetics]]. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ([[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[eukarya]]).

Genetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and [[behavioural genetics|behavior]], often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]]. The [[intracellular]] or [[extracellular]] environment of a cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate. While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the [[arid climate]] only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.

==Etymology==
The word ''genetics'' stems from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|γενετικός}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genetikos}}'' meaning "genitive"/"generative", which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|γένεσις}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genesis}}'' meaning "origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321880&amp;redirect=true |title=Genetikos (γενετ-ικός) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&amp;redirect=true |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321873&amp;redirect=true |title=Genesis (γένεσις) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&amp;redirect=true |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&amp;searchmode=none |title=Genetic |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823020616/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&amp;searchmode=none |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of genetics}}

The observation that living things inherit [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref name="Publishing2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=DK Publishing |title=Science: The Definitive Visual Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFiJFuzRVFQC&amp;pg=PA362 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7566-6490-9 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern science of genetics, seeking to understand this process, began with the work of the [[Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=Weiling&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1887835| doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320400103 |year=1991 |last1=Weiling |first1=F |title=Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822–1884. |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=1–25; discussion 26 |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Mendel, [[Imre Festetics]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble, who lived in Kőszeg before Mendel, was the first who used the word "genetics." He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work ''The genetic law of the Nature'' (Die genetische Gesätze der Natur, 1819). His second law is the same as what Mendel published. In his third law, he developed the basic principles of mutation (he can be considered a forerunner of [[Hugo de Vries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2014|title=Imre Festetics and the Sheep Breeders' Society of Moravia: Mendel's Forgotten "Research Network"|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=12|issue=1|page=e1001772|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001772|author1=Poczai P.|author2=Bell N.|author3=Hyvönen J.|pmid=24465180|pmc=3897355|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|[[Blending inheritance]] leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, makes evolution by natural selection impossible.]]

Other theories of inheritance preceded Mendel's work. A popular theory during the 19th century, and implied by [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', was [[blending inheritance]]: the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents.&lt;ref name="Hamilton2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Hamilton |title=Population Genetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ng85sd1UR7EC&amp;pg=PT26 |year=2011 |publisher=Georgetown University |isbn=978-1-4443-6245-9 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendel's work provided examples where traits were definitely not blended after hybridization, showing that traits are produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend. Blending of traits in the progeny is now explained by the action of multiple genes with [[Quantitative genetics|quantitative effects]]. Another theory that had some support at that time was the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]: the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents. This theory (commonly associated with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]) is now known to be wrong—the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children,&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, J-B (2008). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved from [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-273180 Encyclopædia Britannica Online] on 16 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence in the field of [[epigenetics]] has revived some aspects of Lamarck's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Comeback for Lamarckian Evolution? |publisher=''[[Technology Review]]'' |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/411880/a-comeback-for-lamarckian-evolution/ |accessdate=14 March 2013 |date=4 February 2009 |first=Emily |last=Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories included the [[pangenesis]] of [[Charles Darwin]] (which had both acquired and inherited aspects) and [[Francis Galton]]'s reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler]], ''The Mendelian Revolution: The Emergency of Hereditarian Concepts in Modern Science and Society'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989): chapters 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern genetics started with Mendel's studies of the nature of inheritance in plants. In his paper "''Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden''" ("[[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]]"), presented in 1865 to the ''Naturforschender Verein'' (Society for Research in Nature) in [[Brünn]], Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.&lt;ref name="mendel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mendel's Paper in English |url=http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html |first=Roger B. |last=Blumberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113051202/http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html |archivedate=13 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits, Mendel's work suggested that heredity was particulate, not acquired, and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios.

The importance of Mendel's work did not gain wide understanding until 1900, after his death, when [[Hugo de Vries]] and other scientists rediscovered his research. [[William Bateson]], a proponent of Mendel's work, coined the word ''genetics'' in 1905&lt;ref&gt;genetics, ''n.'', [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 3rd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm |title=Letter from William Bateson to Alan Sedgwick in 1905 |publisher=The John Innes Centre |accessdate=15 March 2008 |author=Bateson W |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013020831/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Note that the letter was to an Adam Sedgwick, a zoologist and "Reader in Animal Morphology" at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]&lt;/ref&gt; (the adjective ''genetic'', derived from the Greek word ''genesis''—γένεσις, "origin", predates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860&lt;ref&gt;genetic, ''adj.'', Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;). Bateson both acted as a mentor and was aided significantly by the work of female scientists from Newnham College at Cambridge, specifically the work of [[Becky Saunders]], [[Nora Darwin Barlow]], and [[Muriel Wheldale Onslow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richmond |first1=Marsha L |title=Opportunities for women in early genetics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=November 2007 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=897–902 |url=http://www.nature.com/reviews/genetics |doi=10.1038/nrg2200 |pmid=17893692 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516070928/http://www.nature.com/reviews/genetics/ |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson popularized the usage of the word ''genetics'' to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in [[London]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="bateson_genetics"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Bateson, W |title=The Progress of Genetic Research |editor=Wilks, W |booktitle=Report of the Third 1906 International Conference on Genetics: Hybridization (the cross-breeding of genera or species), the cross-breeding of varieties, and general plant breeding|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |location=London |year=1907}} :Initially titled the "International Conference on Hybridisation and Plant Breeding", the title was changed as a result of Bateson's speech.

After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. In 1911, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] argued that genes are on [[chromosome]]s, based on observations of a sex-linked [[White (mutation)|white eye]] mutation in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icb/23.4.855 |title=Thomas Hunt Morgan—The Geneticist |year=1983 |last1=Moore |first1=John A. |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=23 |pages=855–865 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, his student [[Alfred Sturtevant]] used the phenomenon of [[genetic linkage]] to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sturtevant AH |year=1913 |title=The linear arrangement of six sex-linked factors in Drosophila, as shown by their mode of association |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=14 |pages=43–59 |url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/s/ahs-13.pdf |doi=10.1002/jez.1400140104 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227183131/http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/s/ahs-13.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.37.9595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes, chromosomes are composed of both protein and DNA, and scientists did not know which of the two is responsible for inheritance. In 1928, [[Frederick Griffith]] discovered the phenomenon of [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (see [[Griffith's experiment]]): dead bacteria could transfer [[genetic material]] to "transform" other still-living bacteria. Sixteen years later, in 1944, the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] identified DNA as the molecule responsible for transformation.&lt;ref name=Avery_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1084/jem.79.2.137 |last1=Avery |first1=OT |last2=MacLeod |first2=CM |last3=McCarty |first3=M |title=Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types: Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=137–58 |year=1944 |pmid=19871359 |pmc=2135445}} Reprint: {{cite journal |pmid=33226 |year=1979 |last1=Avery |first1=OT |last2=MacLeod |last3=McCarty |title=Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types.

Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance works, it was still not known how DNA influences the behavior of cells.

==Features of inheritance==

===Discrete inheritance and Mendel's laws===
{{main|Mendelian inheritance}}
[[File:Punnett square mendel flowers.svg|right|thumb|A [[Punnett square]] depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms.]]
At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units, called [[gene]]s, from parents to offspring.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect199&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J. F. |editor-last=Griffiths |editor2-first=Jeffrey H. |editor2-last=Miller |editor3-first=David T. |editor3-last=Suzuki |editor4-first=Richard C. |editor4-last=Lewontin |editor5-last=Gelbart |title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7167-3520-5 |edition=7th |publisher=W.

Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.199 |chapter=Patterns of Inheritance: Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property was first observed by [[Gregor Mendel]], who studied the segregation of heritable traits in [[pea]] plants.&lt;ref name="mendel" /&gt;&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect200&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J.

H. Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.200 |chapter=Mendel's experiments}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his experiments studying the trait for flower color, Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white—but never an intermediate between the two colors. These different, discrete versions of the same gene are called [[allele]]s.

In the case of the pea, which is a [[diploid]] species, each individual plant has two copies of each gene, one copy inherited from each parent.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect484/&gt; Many species, including humans, have this pattern of inheritance. Diploid organisms with two copies of the same allele of a given gene are called [[homozygous]] at that [[Locus (genetics)|gene locus]], while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called [[heterozygous]].

The set of alleles for a given organism is called its [[genotype]], while the observable traits of the organism are called its [[phenotype]]. When organisms are heterozygous at a gene, often one allele is called [[Dominant allele|dominant]] as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other allele is called [[Recessive allele|recessive]] as its qualities recede and are not observed. Some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have [[Dominance relationship#Incomplete and semi-dominance|incomplete dominance]] by expressing an intermediate phenotype, or [[Dominance relationship#Co-dominance|codominance]] by expressing both alleles at once.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect630&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J. F. |editor-last=Griffiths |editor2-first=Jeffrey H. |editor2-last=Miller |editor3-first=David T. |editor3-last=Suzuki |editor4-first=Richard C. |editor4-last=Lewontin |editor5-last=Gelbart |title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7167-3520-5 |edition=7th |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.630 |chapter=Interactions between the alleles of one gene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a pair of organisms [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent. These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Segregation|Mendel's first law]] or the Law of Segregation.

===Notation and diagrams===
[[File:Pedigree-chart-example.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Genetic pedigree charts help track the inheritance patterns of traits.]]
Geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance. A gene is represented by one or a few letters. Often a "+" symbol is used to mark the usual, [[Wild type|non-mutant allele]] for a gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.users.cnu.edu/rcheney/Genetic%20Notation.htm|title=Genetic Notation|last=Cheney|first=Richard W.|date=|website=|publisher=Christopher Newport University|accessdate=18 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103021518/http://faculty.users.cnu.edu/rcheney/Genetic%20Notation.htm|archivedate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fertilization and breeding experiments (and especially when discussing Mendel's laws) the parents are referred to as the "P" generation and the offspring as the "F1" (first filial) generation. When the F1 offspring mate with each other, the offspring are called the "F2" (second filial) generation. One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross-breeding is the [[Punnett square]].

When studying human genetic diseases, geneticists often use [[pedigree chart]]s to represent the inheritance of traits.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect229&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J. F. |editor-last=Griffiths |editor2-first=Jeffrey H. |editor2-last=Miller |editor3-first=David T. |editor3-last=Suzuki |editor4-first=Richard C. |editor4-last=Lewontin |editor5-last=Gelbart |title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7167-3520-5 |edition=7th |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.229 |chapter=Human Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree.

===Multiple gene interactions===
[[File:Galton-height-regress.png|thumb|right|Human height is a trait with complex genetic causes. [[Francis Galton]]'s data from 1889 shows the relationship between offspring height as a function of mean parent height. ]]
Organisms have thousands of genes, and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other. This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers. This phenomenon, known as "[[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment (The "Second Law")|Mendel's second law]]" or the "law of independent assortment," means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations. (Some genes do not assort independently, demonstrating [[genetic linkage]], a topic discussed later in this article.)

Often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait. In the [[Blue-eyed Mary]] (''Omphalodes verna''), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white. When a plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are white—regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles. This interaction between genes is called [[epistasis]], with the second gene epistatic to the first.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect644&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J. F. |editor-last=Griffiths |editor2-first=Jeffrey H. |editor2-last=Miller |editor3-first=David T. |editor3-last=Suzuki |editor4-first=Richard C. |editor4-last=Lewontin |editor5-last=Gelbart |title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7167-3520-5 |edition=7th |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.644 |chapter=Gene interaction and modified dihybrid ratios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traits are not discrete features (e.g. purple or white flowers) but are instead continuous features (e.g. human height and [[Human skin color|skin color]]). These [[complex traits]] are products of many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15931374 |doi=10.1172/JCI25421 |year=2005 |last1=Mayeux |first1=R |title=Mapping the new frontier: complex genetic disorders |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=1404–7 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |pmc=1137013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these genes is mediated, to varying degrees, by the environment an organism has experienced. The degree to which an organism's genes contribute to a complex trait is called [[heritability]].&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect4009&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J.

For example, human height is a trait with complex causes. It has a heritability of 89% in the United States. In Nigeria, however, where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and [[health care]], height has a heritability of only 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Guo|first2=X|last3=Adeyemo|first3=AA|last4=Wilks|first4=R|last5=Forrester|first5=T|last6=Lowe Jr|first6=W|last7=Comuzzie|first7=AG|last8=Martin|first8=LJ|last9=Zhu|first9=X|year=2001|title=Heritability of obesity-related traits among Nigerians, Jamaicans and US black people|journal=International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1034–41|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801650|pmid=11443503|last1=Luke|first1=A|last10=Rotimi|last11=Cooper|first10=CN|first11=RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular basis for inheritance==

===DNA and chromosomes===
{{main|DNA|Chromosome}}
[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|right|The [[molecular structure]] of DNA. Bases pair through the arrangement of [[hydrogen bonding]] between the strands.]]
The [[Molecule|molecular]] basis for genes is [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). DNA is composed of a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, of which there are four types: [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), and [[thymine]] (T). Genetic information exists in the sequence of these nucleotides, and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the DNA chain.&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a |year=2006 |last1=Pearson |first1=H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |journal=Nature |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]]es are the only exception to this rule—sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule [[RNA]] instead of DNA as their genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Microbiology |last=Prescott |first=L |year=1993 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers |isbn=978-0-697-01372-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses cannot reproduce without a [[Host (biology)|host]] and are unaffected by many genetic processes, so tend not to be considered living organisms.

DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule, coiled into the shape of a [[double helix]]. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance: [[DNA replication]] duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand.&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect1523&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J.

Genes are arranged linearly along long chains of DNA base-pair sequences. In [[bacteria]], each cell usually contains a single circular [[Nucleoid|genophore]], while [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms (such as plants and animals) have their DNA arranged in multiple linear chromosomes. These DNA strands are often extremely long; the largest human chromosome, for example, is about 247 million [[base pair]]s in length.&lt;!--

 --&gt;The DNA of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize, compact, and control access to the DNA, forming a material called [[chromatin]]; in eukaryotes, chromatin is usually composed of [[nucleosome]]s, segments of DNA wound around cores of [[histone]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al.

In evolution, this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes, while the [[X chromosome]] is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes. The X and Y chromosomes form a strongly heterogeneous pair.

===Reproduction===
{{main|Asexual reproduction|Sexual reproduction}}
When cells divide, their full genome is copied and each [[Cell division|daughter cell]] inherits one copy. This process, called [[mitosis]], is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for [[asexual reproduction]]. Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms, producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent. Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called [[Cloning|clones]].

[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] organisms often use [[sexual reproduction]] to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome ([[haploid]]) and double copies ([[diploid]]).&lt;ref name=griffiths2000sect484/&gt; Haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell [[gamete]]s such as [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|egg]]s.

Although they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, [[bacteria]] have many methods of acquiring new genetic information. Some bacteria can undergo [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium.&lt;!--

===Recombination and genetic linkage===
{{main|Chromosomal crossover|Genetic linkage}}
[[File:Morgan crossover 2 cropped.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s 1916 illustration of a double crossover between chromosomes.]]
The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to [[independent assortment|assort independently]] or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed. In this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair. Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine. However, they do, via the cellular process of [[chromosomal crossover]]. During crossover, chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA, effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes.&lt;!--

H. Freeman |location=New York |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=iga.section.929 |chapter=Nature of crossing-over}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--
 --&gt;This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during [[meiosis]], a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells.

The first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931. Their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Correlation of Cytological and Genetical Crossing-Over in Zea Mays|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points. For an arbitrarily long distance, the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated.&lt;ref name="Staub1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jack E. Staub |title=Crossover: Concepts and Applications in Genetics, Evolution, and Breeding |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R43qWg5A-GsC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=1994 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-299-13564-5 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; For genes that are closer together, however, the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate [[genetic linkage]]; alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together. The amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear [[Genetic linkage#Linkage map|linkage map]] that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome.&lt;!--

===Genetic code===
{{main|Genetic code}}
[[File:Genetic code.svg|thumb|left|The [[genetic code]]: Using a [[Genetic code#Discovery|triplet code]], DNA, through a [[messenger RNA]] intermediary, specifies a protein.]]
Genes generally [[Gene expression|express]] their functional effect through the production of [[protein]]s, which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each of which is composed of a sequence of [[amino acid]]s, and the DNA sequence of a gene (through an RNA intermediate) is used to produce a specific [[peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]]. This process begins with the production of an [[RNA]] molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

This [[messenger RNA]] molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a [[codon]], corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an [[stop codon|instruction to end the amino acid sequence]]; this correspondence is called the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |vauthors=Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND |edition=5th |year=2002 |publisher=W.

The specific sequence of amino acids [[protein folding|results]] in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.388 I.3. Proteins: The Shape and Structure of Proteins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al.

Proteins: Protein Function] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425162405/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.452 |date=25 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein [[collagen]]. Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as [[enzyme]]s by facilitating [[chemical reaction]]s within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein [[hemoglobin]] bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood.

A [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide difference]] within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules. For example, [[sickle-cell anemia]] is a human [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]] that results from a single base difference within the [[coding region]] for the β-globin section of hemoglobin, causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin's physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Does Sickle Cell Cause Disease? |url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=23 July 2007 |publisher=Brigham and Women's Hospital: Information Center for Sickle Cell and Thalassemic Disorders |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923165921/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sickle-cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves, stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of [[red blood cell]]s carrying the protein. These sickle-shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through [[blood vessel]]s, having a tendency to clog or degrade, causing the medical problems associated with this disease.

Some DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA but are not translated into protein products—such RNA molecules are called [[non-coding RNA]]. In some cases, these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions (e.g. [[ribosomal RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]]). RNA can also have regulatory effects through hybridization interactions with other RNA molecules (e.g. [[microRNA]]).

===Nature and nurture===
{{main|Nature and nurture}}
[[File:Niobe050905-Siamese Cat.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Siamese (cat)|Siamese cat]]s have a temperature-sensitive pigment-production mutation.]]
Although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function, the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotypes an organism displays. The phrase "[[nature and nurture]]"  refers to this complementary relationship. The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment. An interesting example is the coat coloration of the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese cat]]. In this case, the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment. The cat's genes code for dark hair, thus the hair-producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair. But these dark hair-producing proteins are sensitive to temperature (i.e. have a mutation causing temperature-sensitivity) and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] in higher-temperature environments, failing to produce dark-hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature. In a low-temperature environment, however, the protein's structure is stable and produces dark-hair pigment normally. The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder{{emdash}}such as its legs, ears, tail and face{{emdash}}so the cat has dark-hair at its extremities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Geary|first2=LA|last3=Grahn|first3=RA|last4=Lyons|first4=LA|year=2006|title=Albinism in the domestic cat (''Felis catus'') is associated with a tyrosinase (TYR) mutation|journal=Animal Genetics|volume=37|issue=2|pages=175–8|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01409.x|pmc=1464423|pmid=16573534|last1=Imes|first1=DL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |title=MedlinePlus: Phenylketonuria |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=NIH: National Library of Medicine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725183720/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid [[phenylalanine]], causing a toxic build-up of an intermediate molecule that, in turn, causes severe symptoms of progressive intellectual disability and seizures. However, if someone with the phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid, they remain normal and healthy.

A common method for determining how genes and environment ("nature and nurture") contribute to a phenotype involves [[twin study|studying identical and fraternal twins]], or other siblings of [[multiple birth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|title= Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience and What Makes Us Human|first= M.|publisher= Fourth Estate|year= 2003|isbn= 978-1-84115-745-0|location= |page= 73|quote= |via= |author= Ridley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identical siblings are genetically the same since they come from the same zygote. Meanwhile, fraternal twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings. By comparing how often a certain disorder occurs in a pair of identical twins to how often it occurs in a pair of fraternal twins, scientists can determine whether that disorder is caused by genetic or postnatal environmental factors. One famous example involved the study of the [[Genain quadruplets]], who were [[Multiple birth|identical quadruplets]] all diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Genain"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
However, such tests cannot separate genetic factors from environmental factors affecting fetal development.

===Gene regulation===
{{main|Regulation of gene expression}}
The genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes, but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment. A gene is [[Gene expression|expressed]] when it is being transcribed into mRNA and there exist many cellular methods of controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by the cell. [[Transcription factor]]s are regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, either promoting or inhibiting the transcription of a gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11823631 |doi=10.1126/science.1066355 |year=2002 |last1=Brivanlou |first1=AH |last2=Darnell Jr |title=Signal transduction and the control of gene expression |volume=295 |issue=5556 |pages=813–8 |journal=Science |first2=JE |bibcode=2002Sci...295..813B|citeseerx=10.1.1.485.6042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the genome of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria, for example, there exists a series of genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid [[tryptophan]]. However, when tryptophan is already available to the cell, these genes for tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed. The presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes—tryptophan molecules bind to the [[Trp repressor|tryptophan repressor]] (a transcription factor), changing the repressor's structure such that the repressor binds to the genes. The tryptophan repressor blocks the transcription and expression of the genes, thereby creating [[negative feedback]] regulation of the tryptophan synthesis process.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts et al. (2002), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.1269#1270 II.3.

[[File:Zinc finger DNA complex.png|thumb|upright|left|Transcription factors bind to DNA, influencing the transcription of associated genes.]]

Differences in gene expression are especially clear within [[multicellular organism]]s, where cells all contain the same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes. All the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell, differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and [[Cell signaling|intercellular signals]] and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors. As no single gene is responsible for the [[Development (biology)|development]] of structures within multicellular organisms, these patterns arise from the complex interactions between many cells.

Within [[eukaryote]]s, there exist structural features of [[chromatin]] that influence the transcription of genes, often in the form of modifications to DNA and chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng1089 |pmid=12610534 |year=2003 |last1=Jaenisch |first1=R |last2=Bird |title=Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals |volume=33 Suppl |pages=245–54 |journal=Nature Genetics |first2=A |issue=3s |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v33/n3s/pdf/ng1089.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517112119/http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v33/n3s/pdf/ng1089.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features are called "[[epigenetic]]" because they exist "on top" of the DNA sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to the next. Because of epigenetic features, different cell types [[cell culture|grown]] within the same medium can retain very different properties. Although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over the course of development, some, like the phenomenon of [[paramutation]], have multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule of DNA as the basis for inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 |pmid=17320501 |year=2007 |last1=Chandler |first1=VL |title=Paramutation: from maize to mice |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=641–5 |journal=Cell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gene-duplication.png|thumb|upright|Gene duplication allows diversification by providing redundancy: one gene can mutate and lose its original function without harming the organism.]]
During the process of [[DNA replication]], errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors, called [[mutation]]s, can affect the phenotype of an organism, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are usually very low—1 error in every 10–100&amp;nbsp;million bases—due to the "proofreading" ability of [[DNA polymerase]]s.&lt;!--

 --&gt;New species are formed through the process of [[speciation]], often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other.&lt;!--

By comparing the [[Sequence homology|homology]] between different species' genomes, it is possible to calculate the evolutionary distance between them and [[Molecular clock|when they may have diverged]]. Genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method of characterizing the relatedness between species than the comparison of phenotypic characteristics. The evolutionary distances between species can be used to form [[evolutionary tree]]s; these trees represent the [[common descent]] and divergence of species over time, although they do not show the transfer of genetic material between unrelated species (known as [[horizontal gene transfer]] and most common in bacteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12175808 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02744-0 |year=2002 |last1=Wolf |first1=YI |last2=Rogozin |last3=Grishin |last4=Koonin |title=Genome trees and the tree of life |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=472–9 |journal=Trends in Genetics |first2=IB |first3=NV |first4=EV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model organisms===
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|The [[common fruit fly]] (''Drosophila melanogaster'') is a popular [[model organism]] in genetics research.]]
Although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms, researchers began to specialize in studying the genetics of a particular subset of organisms. The fact that significant research already existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for further study, and so eventually a few [[model organism]]s became the basis for most genetics research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loci.wisc.edu/outreach/text/model.html |title=The Use of Model Organisms in Instruction |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=University of Wisconsin: Wisconsin Outreach Research Modules |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313023531/http://www.loci.wisc.edu/outreach/text/model.html |archivedate=13 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of [[gene regulation]] and the involvement of genes in [[morphogenesis|development]] and [[cancer]].

Organisms were chosen, in part, for convenience—short generation times and easy [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] made some organisms popular genetics research tools. Widely used model organisms include the gut bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', baker's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', the common fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), and the common house mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]'').

===Medicine===
[[File:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|Schematic relationship between [[biochemistry]], genetics and [[molecular biology]].]]
[[Medical genetics]] seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=gnd&amp;ref=sidebar |title=NCBI: Genes and Disease |publisher=NIH: National Center for Biotechnology Information |accessdate=15 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220074727/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=gnd&amp;ref=sidebar |archivedate=20 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease, researchers commonly use [[genetic linkage]] and genetic [[pedigree chart]]s to find the location on the genome associated with the disease. At the population level, researchers take advantage of [[Mendelian randomization]] to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases, a method especially useful for [[Quantitative trait locus|multigenic traits]] not clearly defined by a single gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ebrahim|first2=S|year=2003|title='Mendelian randomization': Can genetic epidemiology contribute to understanding environmental determinants of disease?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1093/ije/dyg070|pmid=12689998|last1=Davey Smith|first1=G|authorlink1=George Davey Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a candidate gene is found, further research is often done on the corresponding (or [[Homology (biology)|homologous]]) genes of model organisms. In addition to studying genetic diseases, the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of [[pharmacogenetics]]: the study of how genotype can affect drug responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PGRN/Background/FactSheet.htm |title=Pharmacogenetics Fact Sheet |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=NIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512012316/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PGRN/Background/FactSheet.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=SA |title=Genetic predisposition to cancer – insights from population genetics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=764–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15510167 |doi=10.1038/nrg1450}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cancer is a genetic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Strachan T, Read AP |title=Human Molecular Genetics 2 |year=1999 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. |edition=second}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=hmg.chapter.2342 Chapter 18: Cancer Genetics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050926163641/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=hmg.chapter.2342 |date=26 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events. [[Mutation]]s occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger [[Apoptosis|cell death]], but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of [[natural selection]] occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth, creating a cancerous [[Tumour heterogeneity|tumor]] that grows and invades various tissues of the body.

Normally, a cell divides only in response to signals called [[growth factor]]s and [[Contact inhibition|stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells]] and in response to growth-inhibitory signals. It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies, staying within the [[epithelium]] where it is unable to migrate to other organs. To become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes (three to seven). A cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitory signals. Also, it is immortal and can grow indefinitely, even after it makes contact with neighboring cells. It may escape from the epithelium and ultimately from the [[primary tumor]]. Then, the escaped cell can cross the endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by the bloodstream to colonize a new organ, forming deadly [[metastasis]]. Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ([[somatic mutation]]s). The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of [[p53 protein]], a [[tumor suppressor]], or in the p53 pathway, and gain of function mutations in the [[Ras proteins]], or in other [[oncogene]]s.

===Research methods===
[[File:Ecoli colonies.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' produced by [[Cloning#Unicellular organisms|cellular cloning]]. A similar methodology is often used in [[molecular cloning]].]]
DNA can be manipulated in the laboratory. [[Restriction enzymes]] are commonly used [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA at specific sequences, producing predictable fragments of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al. (2000), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.section.1582 Chapter 7: 7.1. DNA Cloning with Plasmid Vectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527183555/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.section.1582 |date=27 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fragments can be visualized through use of [[gel electrophoresis]], which separates fragments according to their length.

The use of [[DNA ligase|ligation enzymes]] allows DNA fragments to be connected. By binding ("ligating") fragments of DNA together from different sources, researchers can create [[recombinant DNA]], the DNA often associated with [[genetically modified organism]]s. Recombinant DNA is commonly used in the context of [[plasmid]]s: short circular DNA molecules  with a few genes on them. In the process known as [[molecular cloning]], researchers can amplify the DNA fragments by inserting plasmids into bacteria and then culturing them on plates of agar (to isolate [[Cloning#Unicellular organisms|clones of bacteria cell]]s – "cloning" can also refer to the various means of creating cloned ("clonal") organisms).

DNA can also be amplified using a procedure called the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al. (2000), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=PCR&amp;rid=mcb.section.1718 Chapter 7: 7.7. Polymerase Chain Reaction: An Alternative to Cloning]&lt;/ref&gt; By using specific short sequences of DNA, PCR can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of DNA. Because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of DNA, PCR is also often used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences.

===DNA sequencing and genomics===
[[DNA sequencing]], one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics, allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA fragments. The technique of [[Sanger sequencing|chain-termination sequencing]], developed in 1977 by a team led by [[Frederick Sanger]], is still routinely used to sequence DNA fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown TA |title=Genomes 2 |edition=2nd |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-85996-228-2 |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.6452 |chapter=Section 2, Chapter 6: 6.1. The Methodology for DNA Sequencing |publisher=Bios |location=Oxford |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this technology, researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases.

As sequencing has become less expensive, researchers have [[Genome project|sequenced the genome]]s of many organisms using a process called [[genome assembly]], which utilizes computational tools to stitch together sequences from many different fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2002), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.6481 Section 2, Chapter 6: 6.2. Assembly of a Contiguous DNA Sequence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208115742/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.6481 |date=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies were used to sequence the [[human genome]] in the [[Human Genome Project]] completed in 2003.&lt;ref name=human_genome_project&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml |title=Human Genome Project Information |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=Human Genome Project |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315062131/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml |archivedate=15 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; New [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|high-throughput sequencing]] technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of DNA sequencing, with many researchers hoping to bring the cost of resequencing a human genome down to a thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=The race for the $1000 genome|journal=Science|volume=311|issue=5767|pages=1544–6|doi=10.1126/science.311.5767.1544|pmid=16543431|last1=Service|first1=RF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Next-generation sequencing]] (or high-throughput sequencing) came about due to the ever-increasing demand for low-cost sequencing. These sequencing technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently.&lt;ref name=hall2007&gt;{{cite journal

Genomics can also be considered a subfield of [[bioinformatics]], which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of [[biological data]]. A common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and [[personally identifiable information]]. See also [[genomics data sharing]].

== Life ==
Georg Herzog studied at the [[Budapest Music Academy]] from 1917 to 1919, and at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Hochschule für Musik]] in [[Charlottenburg]]. Starting in 1921, he assisted [[Carl Stumpf]] and [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]] in the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]]. In 1925, he emigrated to the United States, where he received a postgraduate degree in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]].  While there, he studied with [[Franz Boas]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. In 1930/31 he went on a research trip to [[Liberia]], where he recorded, on behalf of Sapir, the language and folk music of the [[Jabo people]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jabo language]]&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1935 (and 1947). Through field research, he wrote his doctoral thesis in 1937 ''A comparison of Pueblo and Pima musical styles'' which made him one of the fore-most authoritative scholars for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] music. He taught and conducted research at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Yale University]] and [[Columbia University]]. During [[World War II]], he worked in the [[US Army]] in [[Military Intelligence]].

Herzog was a professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[Indiana University Bloomington]] from 1948 to 1958 where he formally established the [[Archives of Traditional Music]] which he had begun collecting in 1936 while he was at Columbia University. Herzog was a North American pioneer in the field of [[ethnomusicology]] and posed such radical research questions as: ''"do animals have music?"'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the American Musicological Society, Aug. 1941, S. 3f. Note from Rachel Mundy among others: [http://udini.proquest.com/view/natures-music-birds-beasts-and-goid:815405480/ ''Nature's Music: Birds, Beasts, and Evolutionary Listening in the Twentieth Century''.] (Dissertation, abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; His students included [[Bruno Nettl]].

Herzog was a member of the Board of Advisers of the [[Institute of Jazz Studies]] and was briefly president in 1955. He, along with [[David P. McAllester]], [[Alan Merriam]], [[Willard Rhodes]] und [[Charles Seeger]], founded the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ Society for Ethnomusicology], website&lt;/ref&gt; After a serious illness in 1950, he had to give up work in 1958, retired in 1962, and lived for the next twenty years in a sanatorium.

==2016==

The 2016 Google Science Fair closed its entries on May 17, 2016, the Global 16 Finalist were announced on August 11, 2016. The final event took place during 24 to 27 September 2016 at Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Science Fair Awards Show 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSmqjtgkmo|website=You Tube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen finalists competed for top five awards. The first two rounds had two age groups 13-15 and 16-18. However, unlike previous years, top awards during the finalist event did not distinguish between the two age groups of the previous rounds, thus making it particularly challenging event for the contestant compared to all previous years.

The Grand Prize was won by [[Kiara Nirghin]] (16) of South Africa for her project 'Fighting Drought with Fruit'.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web|title= Combatting drought with a Low-Cost, biodegradable Superabsorbent Polymer made out of Orange Peels|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/deb654bce83b15eed364f52fa8685634649014602eca78858c58fec00aa6041a|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lego Education Builder award was won by Anushka Naiknaware (13) of United States, the youngest contestant to win a top award ever, for 'Smart Wound Care for the Future'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/562f25503d252660ac0e8309b7711f3fc2ef084c0fa3598a7a7cf9377fc8adaa|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic Explorer award was won by Mphatso Simbao (18) of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap production of nitrogen pesticides and fertilizers through hydrolysis of plant protein for rural use|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/ae920a381dfc15613b9d8f530d904301ef5b23158fd60c5dc33af8d7a6d98d98|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific American Innovator Award was won by a team of three for 'Fighting Foam Waste with Recycled Filters' from the US [Ashton (14), Luke (14) and Julia (14)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">The '''Hexateuch''' ("six scrolls") is the first six books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:  the [[Torah]] (''[[Pentateuch]]'') and the [[book of Joshua]].&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Hexateuch'' came into scholarly use from the 1870s onwards mainly as the result of work carried out by [[Abraham Kuenen]] and [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{Cite NIE |last=Schmidt |first=Nathaniel |authorlink=Nathaniel Schmidt |wstitle=Hexateuch |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], [[Wilhelm de Wette|de Wette]], [[Karl Heinrich Graf|Graf]], [[Abraham Kuenen|Kuenen]], [[Theodor Nöldeke|Nöldeke]], [[John William Colenso|Colenso]] and others, in his ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' Wellhausen proposed that Joshua represented part of the northern [[Yahwist]] source (''c'' 950 BC), detached from  JE document by the [[Deuteronomist]] (''c'' 650&amp;ndash;621) and incorporated into the [[Deuteronomic history]], with the books of Judges, Kings, and Samuel.

Reasons for this unity, in addition to the presumed presence of the other documentary traditions, are taken from comparisons of the thematic concerns that underlie the narrative surface of the texts. For instance, the ''Book of Joshua'' stresses the continuity of leadership from [[Moses]] to Joshua. Furthermore the theme of ''Joshua'', the fulfillment of God's promise to lead the Israelites to the Promised Land, complements the thematic material of the Pentateuch, which had ended with the Israelites on the border of the Promised Land ready to enter.

The thesis that ''Joshua'' completes the ''Torah'' in a ''Hexateuch'' may be contrasted with the view of scholars following the older rabbinic tradition, as expressed by the compilers of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (compiled between 1901 and 1906), that the ''Pentateuch'' is a complete work in itself.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The thesis may also be contrasted with the view put forward by [[Eduard Meyer]] (1855–1930) that there never was any ''Hexateuch'' per se, but that the ''Law'', ''Joshua'', ''Judges'', ''Samuel'', and ''Kings'' once formed one great historic work.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20411">The '''history of the social sciences''' has origin in the common stock of Western philosophy and shares various precursors, but began most intentionally in the early 19th century with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term "[[social science]]" has come to refer more generally, not just to [[sociology]], but to all those disciplines which analyse society and culture; from [[anthropology]] to [[linguistics]] to [[media studies]].

The idea that society may be studied in a standardized and objective manner, with scholarly rules and methodology, is comparatively recent. While there is evidence of early [[sociology in medieval Islam]], and while philosophers such as [[Confucius]] had long since theorised on topics such as [[social role]]s, the scientific analysis of "Man" is peculiar to the intellectual break away from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and toward the discourses of [[Modernity]]. Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and was influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial revolution]] and the [[French revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper, ''The Social Science Encyclopedia'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of [[Diderot]], with articles from [[Rousseau]] and other pioneers.

Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref name="web-miner.com"&gt;Vessuri, Hebe. (2000). "Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century". ''Current Sociology'' 50, no. 1 (January): 135–150. [http://www.web-miner.com/socsciethics.htm], Social Science Ethics: A Bibliography, Sharon Stoerger MLS, MBA&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[Bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, there continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks. See [[consilience]].

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an influential treatise on [[political philosophy]] and the just life.

[[Aristotle]] published several works on social organization, such as his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', and ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]''.

===Islamic developments===
{{Main|Islamic sociology|Early Muslim sociology}}

Significant contributions to the social sciences were made in Medieval [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. [[Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]] (973–1048) wrote detailed comparative studies on the [[anthropology]] of peoples, religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Walbridge (1998). "Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3), p. 389–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni has also been praised by several scholars for his [[Islam]]ic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;"Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his ''[[Muqaddimah]]''.

===Modern period===

=== Early modern ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
Near the [[Renaissance]], which began around the 14th century, Buridanus and Oresmius wrote on money. In the 15th century St. Atonine of Florence wrote of a comprehensive economic process. In the 16th century Leonard de Leys (Lessius), Juan de Lego, and particularly Luis Molina wrote on economic topics. These writers focused on explaining property as something for "public good".&lt;ref name=Schumpeter1954&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en | title = History of economic analysis | year = 1954 | pages = 70–142 |author = Schumpeter JA. | accessdate = 2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative figures of the 17th century include [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], Hugo Grotius, [[Thomas Hobbes]], John Locke, and Samuel von Putendorf. Thomas Hobbes argued that [[deductive reasoning]] from [[axiom]]s created a scientific framework, and hence his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' was a scientific description of a political [[commonwealth]]. In the 18th century, social science was called moral philosophy, as contrasted from natural philosophy and mathematics, and included the study of natural theology, natural ethics, natural jurisprudence, and policy ("police"), which included economics and finance ("revenue"). Pure philosophy, logic, literature, and history were outside these two categories. [[Adam Smith]] was a professor of moral philosophy, and he was taught by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. Figures of the time included [[François Quesnay]], Rousseau, [[Giambattista Vico]], [[William Godwin]], [[Gabriel Bonnet de Mably]], and [[Andre Morellet]]. The [[Encyclopédie]] of the time contained various works on the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Schumpeter1954/&gt;

=== Late modern ===
This unity of science as descriptive remains, for example, in the time of [[Thomas Hobbes]] who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework, and hence his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. What would happen within decades of his work was a revolution in what constituted "science", particularly the work of [[Isaac Newton]] in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called "natural philosophy", changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific".

While he was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton, the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer, and working by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals was taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets (citation needed).

In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called "Laws" after the usage of the time (see [[philosophy of science]]) became the model which other disciplines would emulate.

==== 19th century ====
{{See also|History of sociology|19th century}}
The term "social science" first appeared in the 1824 book ''An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth'' by [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833). [[Auguste Comte]] (1797–1857) argued that ideas pass through three rising stages, [[theological]], [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]]. He defined the difference as the first being rooted in assumption, the second in [[critical thinking]], and the third in positive observation. This framework, still rejected by many, encapsulates the thinking which was to push [[economic]] study from being a descriptive to a mathematically based discipline. [[Karl Marx]] was one of the first writers to claim that his methods of research represented a [[science|scientific]] view of history in this model. With the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about [[human behavior]] became increasingly common. Among the first were the "Laws" of [[philology]], which attempted to map the change over time of sounds in a [[language]].

Sociology was established by Comte in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology,'' Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier used the term "social physics", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the [[French Revolution]], he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Comte believed a [[Law of three stages|positivist stage]] would mark the final era, after conjectural [[theological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;

It was with the work of [[Charles Darwin]] that the descriptive version of [[social theory]] received another shock. [[Biology]] had, seemingly, resisted mathematical study, and yet the [[Natural Selection|theory of natural selection]] and the implied idea of [[genetic inheritance]]—later found to have been enunciated by [[Gregor Mendel]], seemed to point in the direction of a scientific biology based, like [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], on mathematical relationships. In the first half of the 20th century, [[statistics]] became a free-standing discipline of [[applied mathematics]]. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of [[biology]]. The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, evolutionary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were [[Freud]] in Austria and [[William James]] in the United States. Freud's theory of the functioning of the mind, and James' work on experimental psychology would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well.

Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology",&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism in greater detail. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]]. It also marked a major contribution to the concept of [[structural functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Durkheim, Marx and [[Max Weber]] are typically cited as the three principal architects of social science in the ''science of society'' sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ "Max Weber". ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; "Social science", however, has since become an umbrella term to describe all those disciplines, outside of physical science and art, which analyse human societies.

==== 20th century ====
{{See also|20th century}}
In the first half of the 20th century, [[statistics]] became a free-standing discipline of [[applied mathematics]]. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of biology.

The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, [[evolution]]ary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were [[Freud]] in Austria and [[William James]] in the [[United States]]. Freud's theory of the functioning of the [[mind]], and James' work on experimental [[psychology]] would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well.

One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy would be [[John Dewey]] (1859–1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and [[logic]] to experimental science, for example in his ''Psychology'' of 1887. However, he abandoned Hegelian constructs. Influenced by both [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], he joined the movement in America called [[pragmatism]]. He then formulated his basic doctrine, enunciated in essays such as "The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy" (1910).

This idea, based on his theory of how [[organism]]s respond, states that there are three phases to the process of inquiry:
# Problematic Situation, where the typical response is inadequate.
# Isolation of Data or subject matter.
# Reflective, which is tested empirically.

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences, for example [[Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically "is a poor sort of knowledge", the stage was set for the conception of the humanities as being precursors to "social science."

This change was not, and is not, without its detractors, both inside of academia and outside. The range of critiques begin from those who believe that the [[physical sciences]] are qualitatively different from social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} through those who do not believe in statistical science of any kind,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} through those who disagree with the [[methodology]] and kinds of conclusion of social science,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to those who believe the entire framework of scientificizing these disciplines is mostly from a desire for prestige.

In 1924, prominent social scientists established the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] honor society for the social sciences. Among its key objectives were to promote interdisciplinary cooperation and develop an integrated theory of human personality and organization. Toward these ends, a journal for interdisciplinary scholarship in the various social sciences and lectureship grants were established.

==== Interwar period ====
[[Theodore Porter]] argued in ''The Rise of Statistical Thinking'' that the effort to provide a synthetic social science is a matter of both administration and discovery combined, and that the rise of social science was, therefore, marked by both pragmatic needs as much as by theoretical purity. An example of this is the rise of the concept of [[IQ|Intelligence Quotient]], or IQ. It is unclear precisely what is being measured by IQ, but the measurement is useful in that it predicts success in various endeavors.

The rise of [[industrialism]] had created a series of [[social]], [[economic]], and [[political]] problems, particularly in managing supply and demand in their political economy, the [[Resource management|management of resources]] for [[military]] and developmental use, the creation of mass [[education system]]s to train individuals in symbolic reasoning and problems in managing the effects of [[industrialization]] itself. The perceived senselessness of the "Great War" as it was then called, of 1914–18, now called [[World War I]], based in what were perceived to be "emotional" and "irrational" decisions, provided an immediate impetus for a form of decision making that was more "scientific" and easier to manage. Simply put, to manage the new multi-national enterprises, private and governmental, required more data. More data required a means of reducing it to information upon which to make decisions. Numbers and charts could be interpreted more quickly and moved more efficiently than long texts. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the so-called hard sciences dependent on social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of [[medicine]], [[neuropsychology]], [[Bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences.

In the 1930s this new model of managing decision making became cemented with the [[New Deal]] in the US, and in Europe with the increasing need to manage industrial production and governmental affairs. Institutions such as [[The New School for Social Research]], [[International Institute of Social History]], and departments of "social research" at prestigious universities were meant to fill the growing demand for individuals who could quantify human interactions and produce models for decision making on this basis.

Coupled with this pragmatic need was the belief that the clarity and simplicity of mathematical expression avoided systematic errors of holistic thinking and logic rooted in traditional argument. This trend, part of the larger movement known as [[modernism]] provided the rhetorical edge for the expansion of social sciences.

=== Contemporary developments ===
There continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories which, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks (see [[consilience]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwp.uni-linz.ac.at/lxe/sektktf/gg/GeertzTexts/Empowering_Aristotle.htm Clifford Geertz, "Empowering Aristotle", ''Science'', vol. 293, July 6, 2001, p. 53.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531195118/http://www.iwp.uni-linz.ac.at/lxe/sektktf/gg/GeertzTexts/Empowering_Aristotle.htm |date=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16892">[[File:Igapo.jpg|thumb|right| Igapó in [[Brazil]]]]
'''Igapó''' ({{IPA-pt|igaˈpɔ}}, from [[Tupi language|Old Tupi]]: "root forest") is a word used in [[Brazil]] for [[Blackwater river|blackwater]]-flooded forests in the [[Amazon biome]]. These forests and similar swamp forests are seasonally inundated with freshwater. They typically occur along the lower reaches of [[rivers]] and around freshwater lakes. [[Freshwater swamp forests]] are found in a range of [[climate]] zones, from [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] through [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[subtropical]] to [[tropical]].
In the [[Amazon Basin]] of Brazil, a seasonally [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater]]-flooded forest is known as a [[várzea forest|várzea]], which is similar to igapó in many regards; the key difference between the two habitats is in the type of water that floods the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789361/Rain-Water-Harvesting-by-Freshwater-Flooded-Forests Fresh water flooded forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Igapó is primarily characterized by seasonal inundation caused by abundant rainfall; in some areas, trees can be submerged for up to 6 months of the year.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen"&gt;Haugaasen, Torbjørn  and  Peres, Carlos Augusto. Floristic, edaphic and structural characteristics of flooded and unflooded forests in the lower Rio Purús region of central Amazonia, Brazil. Acta Amaz. [online]. 2006, vol.36, n.1, pp. 25-35 &lt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0044-59672006000100005&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These ecosystems are relatively open and feature over 30% [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover with an average canopy height ranging from 20–25 m; sparse measurements of trees can reach 33–36 m. Tree composition includes a varied mixture of leaf types and seasonality. Development of tree communities within the freshwater swamp forests rely heavily on microtopography and flooding intensity. Swamp forests can have harsh environments, in which only a few adapted species are able to sustain life or dominate over other tree species. One of the tree species mostly found in freshwater swamp forests are [[Fabaceae|legume]] trees, in which most swamp forests have high single legume species populations. Legume trees in these forests are thought to be abundant in [[nitrogen fixation]], which is most common in waterlogged locations and is thought to be a favorable trait when experiencing seasonal and/or constant waterlogging.&lt;ref name="Koponen"&gt;Koponen, Piia, Pekka Nygren, et al. "Tree Species Diversity and Forest Structure in Relation to Microtopography in a Tropical Freshwater Swamp Forest in French Guiana." Plant Ecology. 173.1 (2004): 17-32. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/20146617.&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freshwater swamp forests can be classified into two categories of forested [[wetland]]s, which are permanently and periodically flooded forests. It is possible to find these two types because of the high microtopographic variation. Due to these topographic differences, tree communities are delimited and have a distribution over small continuous areas.&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt;

These forests may be able to sustain a large amount of [[bird]], [[mammal]], [[reptile]], [[amphibian]], [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]] species, however, [[biodiversity]] varies between wetland ecosystems and the [[species richness]] of the freshwater swamp forests is not entirely known. As for plant species, these forests have a lower diversity compared to other types of forests, such as the terra firme, in South America.&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt;
[[File:IgapoRiverGuide.jpg|thumb|left| A young guide in Óbidos, Para, Brazil]]

==Soil chemistry==

Igapó forests are characterized by sandy [[acidic soil]]s that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water is due to the acidic organic [[Humic acid|humic]] substances (e.g. [[tannins]]) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen"/&gt; Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal [[biomass]]. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest [[phosphorus]] concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions which limits plant growth.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen" /&gt;

==Flora==

Igapó and other flooded forests typically display a lower diversity of plants than that seen in terra firme forests. Similar to other forests found throughout the tropics, it is common to observe only a few dominant tree species&lt;ref name="Koponen" /&gt; Distribution of trees and other plants is highly dependent on inundation tolerances of species causing a non-random distribution of plants where more flood-tolerant species are found at lower elevations and less flood-tolerant species are found on higher ground.
[[Fabaceae]] (or Leguminosae) and [[Euphorbiaceae]] are the dominant families of plants observed in igapó forest.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parolin"&gt;Parolin, P., J. Adis, et al. "Floristic study of an igapó floodplain forest in Central Amazonia, Brazil (Tarumã-Mirim, Rio Negro)." Amazoniana. XVII.1/2 (2004): 29-47. &lt;http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/amazoniana/18_03Parolin.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seed dispersal===
[[File:Colossoma macropomum ostergaard.jpg|thumb|[[Tambaqui|Pacu]] (''Colossoma macropomum''), an important food fish and seed predator common in igapó]]

Tree species adapted to seasonal inundation have adapted to maximize [[fruit]] production during periods of flooding in order to take advantage of newly available [[seed dispersal]] methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and [[monkey]]s is secondary to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of [[seed predator]]s. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in [[characin]]s, such as [[catfish]], digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are [[bottom-feeder]]s, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.&lt;ref name="Kubitzki"&gt;Kubitzki, Klaus, and Albrecht Ziburski. "Seed Dispersal in Flood Plain Forests of Amazonia." Biotropica. 26.1 (1994): 30-43. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2389108&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
[[File:GiantRiverOtterEating.jpg|thumb|[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')]]
[[File:Tapirus terrestris.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian tapir]] (''Tapirus terrestrus'')]]
Diversity of terrestrial wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding. During periods of inundation, vast numbers of aquatic species migrate into the flooded forest in search of food. Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and [[Amazon dolphin|river dolphins]] and [[giant otter]]s move in to prey upon them.&lt;ref name="Kubitzki" /&gt; Compared to terra firme forests, Igapó features lower nutrients and favors slow-growing plants with low fleshy fruit production, which has resulted in a lower diversity and abundance of animals.&lt;ref name="Fleagle"&gt;Fleagle, J. G.; Janson, Charles; and Reed, Kaye. Primate Communities. Cambridge University Press, 1999. Cambridge Books Online. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511542381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Larger terrestrial mammals have varied strategies of dealing with flooding: [[red brocket deer]] and [[Collared peccary|collared peccaries]] move into islands and shift diet from fruit to browsing woody plants. [[White-lipped peccary|White-lipped peccaries]] and [[Brazilian Tapir|tapirs]] are largely unaffected by seasonal inundation; both species take advantage of the greater abundance of fruit during these times. White-lipped peccaries migrate between flooded and dry areas and tapirs are highly capable swimmers.&lt;ref name="Bodmer"&gt;Bodmer, Richard E. "Responses of Ungulates to Seasonal Inundations in the Amazon Floodplain." Journal of Tropical Ecology. 6.2 (1990): 191-201. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2559266&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arboreal]] mammals such as monkeys tend to be lower in species richness compared to terra firme forests due to the decrease in tree diversity and the resulting lack of variety of suitable food types.&lt;ref name="Parolin" /&gt; A lower population density of birds also reflects the lack of nutrients found in igapo forests.&lt;ref name="Haugaasen 2008"&gt;Haugaasen, Torbjørn, and Carlos A. Peres. "Population abundance and biomass of large-bodied birds in Amazonian flooded and unflooded forests."

Within neighboring igapó forests, 194 species of birds are found; of those, just 58 are restricted to igapó.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme-World Conservation M. "Jaú National Park, Brazil." Jaú National Park, Brazil. The Encyclopedia of Earth, 17 Nov. 2008. &lt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ja%C3%BA_National_Park,_Brazil&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human occupation and use==

Native Amazonians have been using and modifying the forests in which they have lived for thousands of years. Several studies suggest that the presence of nutrient-rich "[[terra preta|black earth]]" in typically nutrient-poor igapó environments indicates intense fertilization and burning of these areas. Black earth is a modified soil characterized by high nutrient content from highly stable organic matter and high levels of phosphorus.
The highly fertile soils and the openness of these areas confirm that the native Amazonians have been using these fields for agriculture.&lt;ref name="Praxis &amp; Blackwater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = German | first1 = Laura A | year = 2004 | title = Ecological Praxis and Blackwater Ecosystems: A Case Study From the Brazilian Amazon | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10745-004-6831-1 | journal = Human Ecology | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 653–83 | doi=10.1007/s10745-004-6831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Amazonians have not only used these areas for crops; they have used their agricultural lands as a place to hunt as well. Many animals (rodents, tapirs and deer) are attracted to these areas for food. The Amazonians produce a surplus so that the animals do not over-consume their food resource. Though, if the animals do start to deplete their crops, they will then harvest higher numbers of animals. Additionally, Amazonians consume fish as a main source of protein. Indigenous peoples understand that, while flooded, the forest serves as an essential feeding ground that increases fish abundance. Because of this, many protect igapó forests from deforestation.&lt;ref name="Use of Forests"&gt;Dufour, Darna L. "Use of Tropical Rain Forests by Native Amazonians." BioScience 40.9 (1990): 652–59. JSTOR. University California Press, Oct. 1990.&lt;https://www.jstor.org.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/stable/pdfplus/1311432.pdf?acceptTC=true&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

The greatest threat to igapó forests is the construction of [[hydroelectric dam]]s on [[tributaries]] of the Amazon river; when constructed, the dams will divert huge amounts of water and dramatically change the [[hydrology]] of the Amazon basin and its ecosystems. Because many flora within seasonally inundated forests are highly adapted to a particular flooding schedule, alterations in flood patterns and the creation of permanently flooded areas will induce higher rates of tree mortality. The loss of these trees will likely affect populations of [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] [[understory]] birds, such as the [[blue-throated piping guan]] and some ''[[Amazon parrot|Amazona]]'' parrots that are restricted to igapó. Loss of habitat will cause migrations of species that will inevitably lead to higher [[Competition (biology)|competition]] in unaffected habitats and possibly local [[extinction]]s.&lt;ref name="Borges"&gt;Borges, Sergio Henrique, and Andre Carvalhaes. "Bird species of black water inundation forests in the Jaú National Park (Amazonas state, Brazil): their contribution to regional species richness." Biodiversity and Conservation. 9. (2000): 201-214. &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/t4j15m7157521657/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pipile cumanensis (Denver Zoo)2.jpg|thumb|[[Blue-throated piping guan]] (''Pipile cumanensis''), one of the species likely to be affected by hydroelectric dams]]

[[Deforestation]] is also a large conservation concern because Igapó forests are characterized by slow tree growth due to low soil nutrient content and high soil acidity. Despite low nutrient availability, Igapó and other floodplain forests can be biodiverse with some partially [[endemic]] species. Due to soil chemistry and seasonal inundation, trees and other resources tend to grow back more slowly after harvest by humans than in other types of Amazonian forests, . Accordingly, igapó forests cannot sustain [[Timber harvesting|timber harvest]]. For the future, igapó forests should be fully protected from logging and deforestation because of the low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] found in them.&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;Ferreira Da Fonseca Júnior, Sinomar, Maria Teresa Fernandez Piedade, and Jochen Schöngart. "Wood Growth of Tabebuia Barbata (E. Mey.) Sandwith (Bignoniaceae) and Vatairea Guianensis Aubl. (Fabaceae) in Central Amazonian Black-water (igapó) and White-water (várzea) Floodplain Forests." Trees 23.1 (2009): 127-34. &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/4001k74g64np0721/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In protected areas, such as [[Jaú National Park]], the lack of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants and a low population of rural families limits the potential for [[Over harvesting|over-harvest]] of fish and [[turtle]] species. However, enforcement of harvest regulation is problematic when there are only three park rangers at the entrance to the park. In other unprotected areas that lack rangers, unregulated harvest of fauna by peoples that move into igapó forests to hunt and fish may adversely affect future stocks.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt; Approximately 3% of the Amazon's seasonally inundated forests are under protection within [[National park (Brazil)|national park]]s or [[Biological reserve (Brazil)|biological reserve]]s.&lt;ref name="Borges" /&gt;

==Notable areas==
[[File:NEO lake jau big.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaú National Park]] as seen from [[Landsat 7]]]]
Freshwater swamp forests are distributed in multiple climate zones throughout the world, such as boreal, temperate, tropical and subtropic zones. They are found in the [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropics]], [[Australasia]], [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalaya]], and the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropics]]. However, they are most notably found in Amazonian areas.

* [[Cantão]]

Igapó forests are one of the distinct natural communities found in the [[Cantão State Park]]. They offer a rich bird fauna that includes some habitat specialists due to the unique ecosystem the blackwater inundation provides. The trees in the igapó bloom once the inundation season begins. They do this so they can drop their fruit into the water to be dispersed by the different fish taxa.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;

* [[Jaú National Park]]

The Jaú National Park was designated in 1980 and is the largest national park in the Amazon Basin and the second largest protected tropical forest. It is known for its high level of biodiversity and varying ecosystems within. The park protects the entire watershed of the Jaú River, which happens to be one of the best examples of a blackwater ecosystem where the water is colored by acidic decomposing organic matter.&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">The concept of imagined (also referred as imaginative) geographies originated from [[Edward Said]], particularly his work on [[Orientalism (book)|critique on Orientalism]]. In this context, "imagined" does not mean to be “false” or “made-up”, but rather is used synonymous with “perceived”. Imagined geographies refers to the perception of a space created through certain imagery, texts, and/or [[discourse]]s&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Imagined geographies can be seen as a form of [[social constructionism]] on par with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s concept of [[imagined communities]]. Edward Said's notion of [[Orientalism]] is tied to the tumultuous dynamics of contemporary history. [[Orientalism]] is often referred to as the West's patronizing perceptions and depictions of the East, but more specifically towards [[Islamic]] and [[Confucian]] states. [[Orientalism]] has also been labeled to as the cornerstone of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Nash, C., 2014. Postcolonial geographies: spatial narratives of inequality and interconnection. In Envisioning human geographies (pp. 110-133). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite often being constructed on a national level, imagined geographies also occur domestically in nations and locally within regions, cities, etc.

==Orientalism==
{{main|Orientalism (book)}}

In his book ''Orientalism'', Edward Said argued that Western culture had produced a view of the "[[Orient]]" based on a particular imagination, popularized through [[academic]] [[Orientalism|Oriental studies]], [[travel writing]], [[anthropology]] and a [[Colonialism|colonial]] view of the Orient. This imagination included painting the orient as feminine- however, Said's view on the gendered nature has been criticized by other scholars due to a limited exploration of the construct.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne P. "Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch. 1, Imagining the World." London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1993 lecture located at York University, Toronto, Canada, Said stressed the role culture plays in Orientalism-based imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=ESaid&gt;Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; By differentiating and elevating a national culture over another a validating process of "othering" is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other". 328-329.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process underlies imagined geographies such as orientalism as it creates a set of preconceived notions for self-serving purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Mountz, Key Concepts in Political Geography, Ch. 28 "The Other"; Edward Said. "Culture and Imperialism" (Lecture): York University, Toronto, February 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In constructing itself as superior, the imperial force or colonizing agent is able to justify its actions as somehow necessary or beneficial to the "other".&lt;ref name=ESaid/&gt;

Despite the broad scope and affect of orientalism as an imagined geography, it and the underlying process of "othering" are discursive and thereby normalized within dominant, Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne P. Sharp. Geographies of Postcolonialism: Ch.1 "Imagining the World". 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this sense that Orientalism may be reinforced in cultural texts such as art, film, literature, music, etc. where one-dimensional and often backwards constructions prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime source of cinematic examples is the documentary-film ''Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People''.&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt;Sut Jhally. Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.&lt;/ref&gt; The film demonstrates the process of orientalism centric "othering" within Western films from the silent era to modern classics such as Disney's ''Aladdin''.&lt;ref name=Jhally/&gt; Inferior, backwards, and culturally stagnate constructions of Oriental "others" become normalized in the minds of Western consumers of cultural texts; reinforcing racist or insensitive beliefs and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Gregory The Colonial Present. Ch. 1. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Orientalism'', Said says that Orientalism is an imagined geography because a) Europeans created one culture for the entirety of the 'Orient', and b) the 'Orient' was defined by text and not by the 'Orient'.

==Theory==
Said was heavily influenced by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], and those who have developed the theory of imagined geographies have linked these together. Foucault states that power and knowledge are always intertwined. Said then developed an idea of a relationship between power and descriptions. Imagined geographies are thus seen as a tool of [[power (sociology)|power]], of a means of controlling and subordinating areas. Power is seen as being in the hands of those who have the right to [[Objectification|objectify]] those that they are imagining. Imagined geographies were mostly based on myth and legend, often depicting monstrous "others". [[Edward Said]] elaborates that: “Europe is powerful and articulate; Asia is defeated and distant." &lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.  “Imaginative Geography and Its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental.”  Orientalism.  New York: Vintage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further writers to have been heavily influenced by the concept of imagined geographies including [[Derek Gregory]] and [[Gerard Toal|Gearóid Ó Tuathail]]. Gregory argues that the [[War on Terror]] shows a continuation of the same imagined geographies that Said uncovered. He claims that the [[Islamic]] world is portrayed as uncivilized; it is labeled as backward and failing. This justifies, in the view of those imagining, the military intervention that has been seen in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. [[Edward Said]] mentions that when [[Islam]] appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, the response was conservative and defensive. Ó' Tuathail has argued that [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] knowledges are forms of imagined geography. Using the example of [[Halford Mackinder]]'s [[Heartland Theory]], he has shown how the presentation of Eastern Europe/Western Russia as a key geopolitical region after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] influenced actions such as the recreation of [[Poland]] and the [[Polish Corridor]] in the 1918 [[Treaty of Versailles]].

This theory has also been used to critique several geographies created; both historically and contemporarily—an example is [[Maria Todorova]]'s work ''[[Imagining the Balkans]]''. [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' has also been criticized as showing a whole set of imagined geographies.{{by whom|date=December 2012}} Halford Mackinder's "imperial gaze" has also been argued to be an important imagined geography [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rcjo/2000/00000011/00000001/art00005] that emphasised the importance of the [[British Empire]] over colonial peoples, and asserted the view of the geographical "expert" with the "[[God's eye view]]".

The principle of '''individuation''', or '''''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}''''',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |pages=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[David Bohm]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manuel De Landa]].

==Usage==
The word ''individuation'' occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===
Philosophically, "individuation" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===
In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], also called [[analytical psychology]], individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] – seen as a developmental [[Psyche (psychology)|psychic process]] during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], and the [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]]s of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Analytical psychology#Self-realization and neuroticism}}

===In the media industry===
The media industry has begun using the term ''individuation'' to denote new printing and online technologies that permit [[mass customization]] of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional [[mass-media]] practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.

Communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] alluded to this trend{{qn|date=June 2015}} when discussing{{when|date=June 2015}} the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=2C5ZRF6d1W&amp;dq=mcluhan%20packaged%20information%20services&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false alluded to this trend], books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Two [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in [[quantum superposition]], e.g., as in [[Schrödinger's cat]] being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] says that [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A ''natural criterion of individuality'' has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=Individuation in Quantum Mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=299–304|doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|bibcode=2011FoPh...41..299J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. 

This view influenced [[Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ... Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states. This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. For Schopenhauer, the mutual independence of spatially separated systems was a necessary a priori truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schrödinger]] put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|last=John Earman, John D. Norton|first=|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Pr|year=1997|isbn=0822939304|location=|pages=131|quote=Schrödinger's biographer, Walter Moore, details the lifelong influence of Schopenhauer on Schrödinger ... or the Schopenhauerian label that Schrödinger put on one folder of papers in his files: "Sammlung der Gedanken über das physikalische Principium individuationis".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carl Jung==
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
According to [[Jungian psychology]], individuation ({{lang-de|Individuation}}) is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G.  ''Psychological Types''.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, [[active imagination]], or [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1962). ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia'' (vol. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation has a [[Holistic health|holistic healing]] effect on the person, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="jung1"/&gt;

In addition to [[Complex (psychology)|Jung's theory of complexes]], his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] filled with mythic images, a non-sexual [[libido]], the general types of [[extraversion and introversion]], the compensatory and prospective functions of [[dream]]s, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). ''The Red Book'', p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], the [[wise old man]] . . . and lastly [[Anima and animus|the anima in man and the animus]] in woman."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] at the start . . . to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] at the second stage, to the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the [[Self]] as the final stage. Some would interpose the [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman]] as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the [[Self]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John, ''Subpersonalities'' (London 1990) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Simondon==
{{Main|Gilbert Simondon}}
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==
{{Main|Bernard Stiegler}}
The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. During a talk given at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The ''I'' is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to ''become one'', that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a [[Metastability|metastable equilibrium]]. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian [[Drive theory#Psychoanalysis|theory of drives]] and to the thinking of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Empedocles]].)
*The ''we'' is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the ''I'' is always inscribed in that of the ''we'', whereas the individuation of the ''we'' takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that  belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the ''I'' and the ''we'' — the individuation of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what [[Gilbert Simondon]] calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of [[Grammar|grammatization]] growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the ''I'' and the individuation of the ''we'' in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as
**the vital individuation of natural organs,
**the technological individuation of artificial organs,
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together.
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, ''qua'' specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

The '''International Food Policy Research Institute''' ('''IFPRI''') is an international agricultural research center founded in the early 1970s to improve the understanding of national agricultural and food policies to promote the adoption of innovations in agricultural technology. Additionally, IFPRI was meant to shed more light on the role of agricultural and rural development in the broader development pathway of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partner: International Food Policy Research Institute |publisher=WorldFish |url=http://www.worldfishcenter.org/international-food-policy-research-institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IFPRI, Washington DC, United States, Bjorn Van Campenhout, Research Fellow |date=2016-07-01 |publisher=BioHorizon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPMR4"&gt;CGIAR Science Council Secretariat. 2006.

==Scope==
IFPRI's institutional strategy rests on three pillars: research, capacity strengthening, and policy communication.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/book-763/ourwork/division/communications Communications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616110654/http://www.ifpri.org/book-763/ourwork/division/communications |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research areas===
Research topics have included low crop and animal productivity, and [[environmental degradation]], [[water management]], fragile lands, [[property rights]], [[collective action]], sustainable intensification of agricultural production, the impact of [[climate change]] on poor farmers, the problems and opportunities of [[biotechnology]],&lt;ref name="ept"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/environment-and-production-technology-eptd Environment and Production Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[food security]], [[micronutrient]] [[malnutrition]], [[microfinance]] programs, urban food security, resource allocation within households,&lt;ref name="phn"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/poverty-health-and-nutrition-phnd Poverty, Health, and Nutrition]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[school feeding in low-income countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Sarah|title=How Effective Are Food for Education Programs?

====Gender and development====
One major area of research is [[gender and development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vyawahare |first=Malavika |title=Are Men Useless? (Government Says Yes) |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 9, 2012 |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/are-men-useless-government-says-yes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, conducted in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], looked at the relative productivity of plots of farm land controlled by men compared to plots controlled by women. They found that the majority of resources are devoted to plots controlled by men, but if resources were diverted to plots controlled by women productivity could increase by as much as 20%. In another study in [[Kenya]], where women get almost no education, they determined that if women farmers were provided one year of primary education, maize production could increase by as much as 24%.&lt;ref name="wkfs"&gt;{{cite web |author=|title="Women, the Key to Food Security" |publisher=IFPRI |date=June 2000 |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/125453/filename/125454.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Studies conducted in [[Egypt]] and [[Mozambique]] found that the education level of adult females in a household is more important than the education level of adult males to bring a household out of poverty. Increasing the education of mothers to completion of primary school decreased the percentage of households below the poverty line by 33.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Datt |first=Gaurav |last2=Jolliffe |first2=Dean |date=October 1999 |title=Determinants of Poverty in Egypt: 1997 |publisher=IFPRI |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/dp75.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}{{failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=Search for 33.7, nothing found}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Datt |first=Guarav |author2=Kenneth R.

The funds were more likely to be spent on children's clothes, education and general well being for both girls and boys.&lt;ref name="wkfs" /&gt;

====Climate change====
One of the areas of research for the IFPRI is the effects of [[climate change]] on developing countries. Climate change describes a global change in the climate, but this does not mean that all areas of the globe will be affected equally or that they will all experience the same type of climate change. Some areas may become warmer while others may become colder. The IFPRI has conducted studies to model the effects of climate change on developing populations.

In 2011, IFPRI published the results of a study in The Republic of [[Yemen]] predicting the economic outcome of climate change in [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] Yemeni communities. The study predicted that the country's [[GDP]] would drop, but that agricultural GDP would increase. It predicted that flooding would cause farmers to lose some crops, but agriculture in general would benefit. The group expected to suffer the most would be rural non-farmers. In the long term, climate change was predicted to damage [[food security]] and cause a decrease in household GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wiebelt |first=Manfred |author2=Clemens Breisinger |author3=Olivier Ecker |author4=Perrihan Al-Riffai |author5=Richard D.

In December 2011, the IFPRI published a report sent to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) highlighting the need for research into agricultural systems likely to be affected by climate change. They highlighted 12 that they suggested should be high research priority:&lt;ref name= unfccc&gt;Beachy, Roger, et al. "Fighting Hunger in a Changing Climate: How Can Agriculture Respond?"

====Malnutrition====
IFPRI has done extensive research into areas related to [[malnutrition]]. They have conducted research all over the world on various issues that arise from or cause malnutrition. They have looked at [[HIV]] and [[Malaria]] and how malnutrition affects the [[epidemiology]] of these diseases. They have looked at the effects of childhood malnutrition on adult health. They have looked at the potential benefits of [[biotech]] crops on childhood nutrition, and the effects of vitamin supplements in general.

A study in [[Ethiopia]] to test cost effectiveness of two different methods of treating malnutrition in children was done by Tekeste Asayehegn. In the study the compared two different methods of long term care for the malnourished children. In the first method children were brought to Therapeutic Feeding Centers where they remained as in-patients. The alternative method involved the supplies to treat malnourished children being sent to local clinics and healthcare facilities where the children were brought on a weekly or fortnight basis for treatment. The nutritional supplements were then sent home with the children. Volunteers checked on the patients at home and brought them to the facilities for treatment. This localized treatment program was found to cut the cost of treating a malnourished child in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tekeste |first=Asayehegn |author2=Mekitie Wondafrash |author3=Girma Azene |author4=Kebede Deribe |title=Cost effectiveness of community-based and in-patient therapeutic feeding programs to treat severe acute malnutrition in Ethiopia |journal=Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation |date=March 19, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1478-7547-10-4 |pmc=3323427 |pmid=22429892 |volume=10 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Uganda the IFPRI conducted a study on the relationship between malnutrition and the incidences of malaria. There were two variables in the study the first was evidence of [[malnutrition]] in the child and the second was whether or not the child was infected with [[HIV]]. The study indicated that there may be a correlation between malnutrition and increased risk of malaria. Both the HIV-negative and positive patients that were malnourished showed higher rates of [[malaria]] than the groups with better nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arinaitwe |first=Emmanuel |author2=''et al.'' |title=The association between malnutrition and the incidence of malaria among young HIV-infected and -uninfected Ugandan children: a prospective study |journal=[[Malaria Journal]] |date=March 27, 2012 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-90 |pmc=3337276 |pmid=22453048 |volume=11 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transgenic crops====
IFPRI neither supports nor opposes [[genetically modified foods]]; however, they have released many publications on the potential impact of using [[transgenic crops]]. There are many types of transgenic crops. Some modify the plant's ability to produce natural pesticides while others affect the nutritional value of the crops themselves. In 2009 IFPRI released a publication that was an overview of the use of [[biotech]] crops between 1997 and 2007. Since the institute maintains a neutral standpoint on the subject, they chose the term "biotech" as being less inflammatory than "genetically modified" or "transgenic".&lt;ref name="meitc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smale |first=Melinda |author2=''et al.'' |title=Measuring the economic impacts of transgenic crops in developing agriculture during the first decade |publisher=IFPRI |year=2009 |url=https://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/26575/filename/26576.pdf |pages=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was a review of many studies conducted during the ten-year time period in several countries around the world.

They observed that many of the studies were inconclusive in terms of the economic value of a crop. For instance, the studies showed conclusively that the use of [[Bt cotton]] reduced the need for pesticide treatment and increased crop yield, but they did not show whether it increased profits for the small farms involved.&lt;ref name="meitc" /&gt; They determined that the information provided to the consumer was important in these studies. Negative messages were very effective at dissuading use.

Overall, the researchers determined that some strains of biotech crops were economically promising especially in countries like [[India]] and [[China]]. They were unwilling to make too strong a judgment on the data provided recommending better studies be conducted over the following ten years to obtain a more complete understanding of the economic effects of biotech crops in developing countries.&lt;ref name="meitc" /&gt; This publication made no observations about potential environmental or health related issues involved with the crops. It simply dealt with potential profits and economic impact.

IFPRI also analyzes agricultural market reforms, trade policy, [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations in the context of agriculture, institutional effectiveness, crop and income diversification, postharvest activity, and [[Intensive farming|agroindustry]].&lt;ref name="mti"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/markets-trade-and-institutions-mtid "Markets, Trade, and Institutions (MTID)"], IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute is involved in measuring the [[Millennium Development Goals]] project and supports governments in the formulation and implementation of development strategies.&lt;ref name="dsg"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/division/development-strategy-and-governance-dsgd "Development Strategy and Governance (DSGD)"], IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further work includes research on agricultural [[innovation system]]s and the role of capacity strengthening in agricultural development.&lt;ref name="kci"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation Knowledge, Capacity, and Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626075634/http://www.ifpri.org/book-36/ourwork/division/knowledge-capacity-and-innovation |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products and publications===
IFPRI targets its policy and research products to many audiences, including developing-country policymakers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil-society organizations, "opinion leaders", donors, advisers, and media.

Publications by IFPRI include books, research reports, but also newsletters, briefs, and fact sheets,&lt;ref&gt;IFPRI's [http://www.ifpri.org/publications Publications &amp; Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} which are also available from IFPRI's Knowledge Repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebrary.ifpri.org/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/IFPRI&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ifpri.org/topic/global-food-policy-report Global Food Policy Report] is one of IFPRI's flagship publications. To meet the needs of policy makers and researchers interested in food security and nutrition, this annual report offers an overview of recent food policy developments that have contributed to or hindered progress in reducing hunger and improving nutrition. It reviews what happened in food policy and why, examines key challenges and opportunities, shares new evidence and knowledge, updates key food policy indicators, and highlights emerging issues. The 2017 Report takes an in-depth look at how rapid urbanization is reshaping food systems and its impact on food security and nutrition for rural and urban populations, focusing on policies to improve rural-urban linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpri.org/book-9464/ourwork/researcharea/global-food-policy-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080825/http://www.ifpri.org/book-9464/ourwork/researcharea/global-food-policy-report |archivedate=February 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 IFPRI introduced the [[2020 Vision Initiative]],&lt;ref name="2020 Vision Initiative"&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/program/2020-vision 2020 Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=Doesn't say when introduced}} which aims at coordinating and supporting a debate among national governments, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, international development institutions, and other elements of civil society to reach food security for all by 2020.

As of 2006 IFPRI produces the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI)&lt;ref name="Global Hunger Index"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/search?keyword=%22Global+Hunger+Index%22 Search IFPRI Web:Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt; yearly measuring the progress and failure of individual countries and regions in the fight against hunger. The GHI is a collaboration of IFPRI, the [[Welthungerhilfe]], and [[Concern Worldwide]].&lt;ref name="Millions Fed Book"&gt;David J.

==Impact==
The evaluation of policy-oriented research poses a lot of challenges including the difficulty to quantify the impact of knowledge and ideas in terms of reduced poverty and or increased income or the attribution of a change in these numbers to a specific study or research project.&lt;ref name="CGImpact"&gt;Mitch Renkow and Derek Byerlee. 2010. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.04.006 The impacts of CGIAR research: A review of recent evidence], Food Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these challenges, studies find that IFPRI research had spill-over effects for specific country-level research, but also in setting the global policy agenda, for example in the areas biodiversity (influencing the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources]]) and trade (with respect to the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiations).&lt;ref name="CGImpact" /&gt;

Another example of IFPRI's impact on policy formulation was the [[2007–2008 world food price crisis]]. IFPRI was able to quickly pull together relevant research and its resulting recommendations were included in the United Nations' Comprehensive Framework for Action on food security.&lt;ref name="foodcrises"&gt;Klaus von Grebmer and Ingeborg Hovland. 2009. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1332/174426409X463910 "Using 'systems awareness': a proposed mechanism for monitoring communications"], ''Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice''.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFPRI leads a number of partnerships that engage different stakeholders to influence policies with an impact on poverty, hunger and food situation of poor people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/topic/ifpri-programs IFPRI-led Policy Programs and Partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt; The newest of these initiatives is [http://www.compact2025.org/ Compact2025], a partnership that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition "Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition"]], 2015. Project Paper. IFPRI: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[CGIAR]] and its agencies, including IFPRI, have been criticized for their connections to Western governments and [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[agribusiness]]. Its research publications have also been cited by critics of [[genetically modified organism]]s in agriculture. IFPRI describes itself as "neither an advocate nor an opponent of [[genetically modified crops]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/ourwork/about/biotech-biosafety?print Note from the Director General] Biotech and Biosafety Policy, Balancing Biotechnology and Biosafety (n.d.){{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many sources recognize CGIAR as having support of smallholders and poor farmers central to its mission.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist''. (February 18, 2012) [http://www.economist.com/node/21547771/ "The nutrition puzzle: Why do so many people in poor countries eat so badly—and what can be done about it?"] "Marie Ruel, of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., ticks off some of the tasks: focus on the first 1,000 days of life (including pregnancy); scale up maternal-health programmes and the teaching of good feeding practices; concentrate on the poor; measure and monitor the problem."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Mark. (2011-09-02) [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/sep/02/east-africa-crisis-investment-pastoralists? "Investment in pastoralists could help combat east Africa food crisis"] ''The Guardian''. "The ILRI, based in Nairobi, is a proponent of pastoralism and asserts that herding in dry areas makes better economic sense than irrigation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' (April 23, 2000) [http://www.economist.com/node/295708 "Biting the silver bullet"] "CGIAR ... help poor farmers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Agriculturist'' (January 2007) [http://www.new-ag.info/en/view/point.php?a=1 "Confronting the Challenges of Change"] "The CGIAR has a very long and successful history of providing agricultural science for the benefit of poor people across the world, and that remains our core mission."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Agriculturist'' (January 2005) [http://www.new-ag.info/en/pov/views.php?a=1268 "The CGIAR: A Bridge to the Future?"] "Tropical agriculture has benefited very significantly from the work of the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research).... the CGIAR's impact, since its founding in the 1970s, is an estimated US$9 return on every US$1 invested."&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''involuntary narrative''' occurs as a personal reading of symbolic content transmitted by media-saturated environments. Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.
The '''involuntary narrative''' has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.

Illusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum.  
When a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called [[vireal]] (Gramelsberger, Klein).

The '''involuntary narrative,''' [[hypnagogia]] and the [[Dreamachine]], trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The '''involuntary narrative''' is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.

Auditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.
Anamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work ''Lexicon:'' ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of “sound phenomena noted in various contexts with acoustic or psychoacoustic connotations”, published in: Palais de Tokyo/Magazine 09, Summer 2009, Spy Numbers, and available online at this address: http://www.pascalbroccolichi.com/index.php?/projets/lexicon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Influences==
As the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of '''involuntary narratives''' emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.
Applying the [[cut-up technique]], invented in the 1960s by [[Bryon Gysin]], to text, [[William Burroughs]]&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, W. S. (1970). The Electronic Revolution. Ubuweb, 2005 edition. http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf (accessed 30-09-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. 
The [[dérive]] (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the [[Situationists]] is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.
Misreadings of common everyday objects, as used in [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]], some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and related fields, a '''kinetic scheme''' is a network of states and connections between them representing the scheme of a dynamical process. Usually a kinetic scheme represents a [[Markovian process]], while for non-Markovian processes generalized kinetic schemes are used. Figure 1 shows an illustration of a kinetic scheme.

==A Markovian kinetic scheme==

===Mathematical description===
A '''kinetic scheme''' is a network (a [[directed graph]]) of distinct states (although repetition of states may occur and this depends on the system), where each pair of states ''i'' and ''j'' are associated with directional rates, &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;). It is described with a [[master equation]]: a first-order [[differential equation]] for the [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; of a system to occupy each one its states at time ''t'' (element ''i'' represents state ''i''). Written in a matrix form, this states: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of connections (rates) &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a '''Markovian kinetic scheme''' the connections are constant with respect to time (and any jumping time probability density function for state ''i'' is an exponential, with a rate equal the value of all the exiting connections). 

When [[detailed balance]] exists in a system, the relation &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}P_{i}(t\rightarrow\infty)=A_{ij}P_{j}(t\rightarrow\infty)&lt;/math&gt; holds for every connected states ''i'' and ''j''. The result represents the fact that any closed loop in a Markovian network in equilibrium does not have a net flow.

Matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; can also represent birth and death, meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, where then, the process is not in equilibrium. These terms are different than a [[birth-death process]], where there is simply a '''linear kinetic scheme'''.

===Specific Markovian kinetic schemes===
* A [[birth-death process]] is a linear one-dimensional Markovian kinetic scheme.
* [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]] are a type of a Markovian kinetic scheme when solved with the steady state assumption for the creation of intermediates in the reaction pathway.

==Generalizations of Markovian kinetic schemes==

* '''A kinetic scheme with time dependent rates''': When the connections depend on the actual time (i.e. matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the time, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ), the process is not Markovian, and the master equation obeys, &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}(t)\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;.  The reason for a time dependent rates is, for example, a time dependent external field applied on a Markovian kinetic scheme (thus making the process a not Markovian one).
* '''A semi-Markovian kinetic scheme''': When the connections represent multi exponential jumping time probability density functions, the process is [[Semi-Markov process|semi-Markovian]], and the equation of motion is an [[integro-differential equation]] termed the generalized master equation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}= \int^t_0 \mathbf{A}(t- \tau )\vec{P}( \tau )d \tau &lt;/math&gt;.
An example for such a process is a [[reduced dimensions form]]. 
* '''The Fokker Planck equation''': when expanding the master equation of the kinetic scheme in a continuous space coordinate, one finds the [[Fokker Planck equation]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
This technique has been used for years in the management and disposal of [[drill cuttings]], oily sludge and other [[gasoline|petroleum]] refinery wastes. The equipment employed in land farming is typical of that used in [[agriculture|agricultural]] operations. These land farming activities cultivate and enhance [[Microorganism|microbial]] degradation of hazardous compounds. As a rule of thumb, the higher the [[molecular weight]] (i.e., the more rings within a [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]), the slower the degradation rate. Also, the more [[chlorine|chlorinated]] or [[nitration|nitrated]] the compound, the more difficult it is to degrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Theodore|first=L|title=Introduction to Hazardous Waste Incineration|year=1987|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|author2=Reynolds, J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Factors that may limit the applicability and effectiveness of the process include:

#large space requirements
#the conditions advantageous for biological degradation of contaminants are largely uncontrolled, which increases the required length of time until complete degradation, particularly for recalcitrant compounds
#inorganic contaminants are not biodegraded
#the potential of large amounts of [[particulates|particulate matter]] released by operations
#the presence of metal ions may be toxic to microbes and may leach from the contaminated soil into the ground.

Hydrocarbon compounds that have been identified as being not readily degraded by land farming include [[creosote]], [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), and [[fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker C oil]].

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

'''Central Europe''' contains several '''life zones''', depending on location and elevation.

Geographically, Central Europe lies between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Apennine peninsula|Apennine]] and [[Balkan peninsula]]s. It includes the plains of [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]; the [[Alps]]; and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The Central European Flora region stretches from Central [[France]]  to Central [[Romania]]  and Southern [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Frey|author1-link=:de:Wolfgang Frey|first2=Rainer|last2=Lösch|author2-link=:de:Rainer Lösch|title=Lehrbuch der Geobotanik|chapter=Pflanze und Vegetation in Raum und Zeit|publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag|location=München|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowlands of Central Europe contain the [[Central European mixed forests]] ecoregion,&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0412|name=Central European mixed forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the mountains host the [[Alps conifer and mixed forests]]&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0501|name=Alps conifer and mixed forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carpathian montane conifer forests]] ecoregions.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0504|name=Carpathian montane conifer forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important factor in the local climate and ecology of Central Europe is the elevation: an increase of elevation by {{convert|1000|m|ft}} causes the average air temperature to drop by {{convert|5|C|F}} and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into [[life zones]] of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

'''Maya Widmaier-Picasso''' (Boulogne-Billancourt, France, 1935) is the daughter of Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Ruiz Picasso]] and [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]]. She has devoted part of her life to the study and preservation of the legacy of her father.

Maya is notably represented in the series of Picasso paintings ''Maya à la poupée.''

She was married to Pierre Widmaier and has had three children: Olivier, Richard, and [[Diana Widmaier Picasso|Diana]]. Diana is an art historian specialized in the work of her grandfather Pablo Picasso.

In 2017, [[Gagosian Gallery]] presented in Paris the exhibition ''Picasso and Maya: Father and Daughter'', curated by [[Diana Widmaier Picasso]]. It was the first exhibition devoted to Picasso's portraits of his eldest daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/10285/the-show-exploring-picassos-relationship-with-his-daughter|title=The Show Exploring Picasso’s Relationship with His Daughter|last=AnOther|date=2017-10-20|work=AnOther|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monte Cristi Pipe Wreck''' is a submerged [[archaeological]] site located off the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] near the border of [[Haiti]], part of the [[Greater Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The site is one of the hundreds of historic shipwrecks that lie on the ocean floor between [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]] and [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence indicates that the shipwreck is one of a merchant trader, probably sinking in the second half of the 17th century. Hispanola, together with [[Jamaica]], was originally settled by adventurous men seeking the life of a [[buccaneer]], and until the 18th century, these islands thrived through [[piracy]] rather than through growing sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This wreck is known as the "Pipe Wreck" because of the large number of [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)#Clay|clay smoking pipes]] it carried as [[cargo]], the type of long pipe the indigenous inhabitants used to smoke tobacco that was a shaped cane and called ''tobago''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Five large masses are visible, covered by a layer of [[calcium carbonate]]. Three of the objects seem to be combinations of iron and copper-alloy, and two appear to be solid slabs of iron. The calcium carbonate furnishes ample material for the [[reef]] [[ecosystem]] that covers the existing [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].&lt;ref name="shipwreck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=J.

[[Image:Omni art performance 1984.jpg|thumb|300px|Jeffrey Milburn's first Omni Art performance installation Denver, Colorado (1984).]]
'''Omni art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in 1988 in [[New York City]] ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Village Voice, 1988. Village Voice Media Group&lt;/ref&gt; Omni art followed [[Pop art]] and [[Postmodernism]] by shifting attention from social and political issues focusing on the emerging convergence of science, consciousness and art in the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Consciousness 2008, Embracing The Journey Podcast with Karen Humphries Sallick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Weekly, Interview for performance installation "Khymera" benefit for The Boulder County AIDS Project.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It draws from ancient [[Sanskrit]] mysticism, [[sacred geometry]], and [[Quantum field theory|theoretical quantum physics]], and its premise maintains that sentient experience is immersed in a multidimensional [[quantum field]] that can be distilled into 5 distinct yet connected planes or dimensions that together weave a Universal fabric or “cosmic soup” of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Creating an Art Style", The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1,2,3. Omni Art Salon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soul artwork 1981 detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Milburn's "Soul" artwork (1981) in detail..]]

==The Omni art Perspective==
Within the Omni art paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;see OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. 2007, Voice One Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; there is an ascending series of vibrational fields ranging from the most coarse in vibratory rate (the physical dimension) to the most subtle and sublime (the etheric dimension). Each of the 5 dimensions (described below) maintain environmental vibrational fields that correlate with universal particle and wave energy signatures with qualities that can be ascertained through both [[empirical]] and subjective methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Observer'', September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey 2007, Voice One Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4276-1589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Colorado Daily,University of Colorado 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Omni art is concerned with exploring and expressing sentient life experiences of and within these 5-dimensional fields that exhibit powerful influences within and upon sentient and other life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Weekly Interview, Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum physicist postulates that a wave/particle model of energy and matter substructs universal cosmology and in this way quantum physicists and Omni artists are concerned with the same observable and intuited phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of an Art Movement,Episodes 1-3. The Omni Art Salon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] postulates that these 5-dimensional vibrational particle and wave fields are experienced in the human consciousness through light and sound waves forming a 5-dimensional matrix that sustains the fabric of existence for all life in the visible and invisible universe.&lt;ref&gt;Omni Art - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. Voice One Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Dimensions of Human Experience==
[[Image:Omni Art Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Language of Consciousness (2007) is a personal description of an art style he developed during the late 1980s and founded as a style in a groundbreaking museum installation in 1991.]]

'''The Physical Dimension''' - The [[primary vibrational field]] has the most dense oscillation pattern and energy signature manifested as matter within the physical universe.

'''The Astral Dimension''' - The [[secondary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the physical dimension. This is where dreams, psychic cognition, human emotions, and paranormal phenomenon take place.

'''The Causal Dimension''' - The [[tertiary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the astral dimension, and is described by many researchers as a resonant “brain” or record of all the cause-effect relationships in the universe, known in ancient [[Vedic]] texts as the [[akasha]].

'''The Mental Dimension''' - The [[quaternary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the causal dimension. The human mind experiences this vibrational field as thoughts, ideas, concepts and connectivity.

'''The Etheric Dimension''' - The [[quinary dimensional field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the mental dimension. This is the subconscious portal to the non-dual dimensions.
This dimension acts as the gateway into non-duality or singularity and can be observed in sudden, unexplainable awareness that spontaneously appears as an "aha!", or sudden, moment of realization.

==The Universalist Group Collection==

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] mounted a museum installation of the foundational collection of 12 artworks called “The Universalist Group.” in 1991 at [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islip_art_museum/index.html The Islip Art Museum]&lt;ref&gt;The Islip Art Museum, Islip, New York. March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in Islip, New York. This group of 12 assemblage artworks were created over a period of 10 years beginning in 1981, and provide the basic vocabulary for the language of the Omni art style. Milburn coined this style of art “Omni art” in 1988 when he founded this nascent art movement. The Universalist Group collection has appeared in whole or in part in all of Milburn's performance installations over the last 30 years and is described in detail in his book, OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn’s treatise regarding Omni art.

Milburn's artworks are assemblages of found objects, canvas, and paint. Milburn describes the juxtaposition of objects in his artworks as creating a gestalt “language” allowing the observer to communicate with an inner experience he describes as a “language of consciousness” that is attuned to the observer's current state of developmental awareness. In this way, each artwork serves as a catalyst for a personal inspiration or realization that mirrors what quantum physicists describe as the observer and observed duality that collapses into a singularity field. This is the same [[Omega Point|singularity]] that scientists and ancient spiritual teachers describe as “Source” or “Oneness” that is the origination point for all particles and waves that form the phenomenon of existence.

In this way, Omni art is literally defined as “God art” or “Source art” both by intentional application and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] utilization. The term Omni was discovered by Milburn when researching terminology that would apply to this emerging art form. Milburn describes his role as one of an artist/mystic and subsequently he has come to be known as “The Oracle of Omni.”

[[Image:Omni art universalist group.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Artist's statement from a 1991 installation at The Islip Art Museum in Islip, New York.]]

===Sacred Geometry===

One of the two primary artworks from The Universalist Group collection titled “SOUL” (1981) contains many elements that are fundamental in the science of [[sacred geometry]]. Surrounding the mirror in the center circle on this art work are 5 hand cut quartz crystals in the shape of the 5 platonic solids originally discovered and articulated upon by [[Plato]].

Milburn identified these platonic solids as corresponding to the 5-dimensional vibrational fields which he deduced constitute the basic elements forming a universal cosmological structure.

This center circle area is fronted with a 3-dimensional metaform mandala projecting out from the front of the artwork also containing many sacred geometry's. Milburn discovered 16 years after creating this artwork that its basic shape reflects the geometric shape of a black hole and posited that this peculiarity pertains to the ancient [[Kabbalistic]] theory that all in the invisible universe is reflected in the visible universe - or more commonly stated as “as above, so below.” In quantum physics jargon this same cosmological structure was articulated by physicist [[David Bohm]] as an “implicate and explicate order.”

Milburn further describes this artwork as a symbolic map or representation of universal [[cosmological]] structures that integrate with emerging scientific theories of conscious human evolution.

===The Omni art Movement===
According to Milburn, conscious human evolution is intrinsic and incontrovertible and can be seen in all aspects of life.  It naturally follows that this conscious evolution can then be observed in all the arts, sciences, and cultural idioms and he coined this process “meta-evolution” as it transcends the boundaries of [[scientific materialism]]. Reaching into the invisible regions of discovery not accessible by current technology, this evolutionary phenomenon is seen by Milburn to be the definition of the Omni art movement in the widest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a New Art, The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rocky Mountain News, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;radio interview, KGNU Boulder Public Radio 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Public Dialogue on The Four Propositions 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Milburn states that in popular culture one can observe the contemporary appearance of this meta-evolutionary process in contemporary films, books, and videos exploring the many aspects of emerging awareness as it intersects with a popular fascination with metaphysical and [[paranormal phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Orbiting Omni Art", The Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this phenomenon such as UFO sightings, and most recently the light orbs that are appearing by the hundreds of thousands in low resolution (below 2 mega-pixels) digital photographs espoused upon in [[Miceal Ledwith]] and physicist Klaus Heinemann's 2008 book [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/Orb-Project/Klaus-Heinemann/9781582701820 The Orb Project], have captured the imaginations of millions of people around the world and show no sign of abating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''''opus gallicum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Gallic work") was a technique of construction whereby precise holes were created in stone masonry for the insertion of wooden beams to create a wooden infrastructure. The technique was so named because, though its presence is attested in protohistoric times, its use was common enough in [[Gaul]] to merit mention in [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[De Bello Gallico|De bello Gallico]]'' and was frequently employed in the [[Merovingian]] era. The technique was imported by the [[Normans]] into the [[Molise]], where it was used extensively in the raising of [[castle]]s in a short time. Gaulish masons are even known to have brought the technique from Merovingian Francia to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and employed it in [[church architecture]]. 

The ''opus gallicum'' served not only as an infrastructural base, but also a [[Superstructure|superstructural]] binding element designed to strengthen the masonry. While the arrangement of some of the holes found in preserved structures is often perplexing, leaving doubt as to the exact function of the beams, modern scholarship has largely moved away from the theory that the ''opus gallicum'' was a rare and inefficient method. Overall the technique was not uncommon in the Middle Ages.

'''Phantom power''', in the context of [[Professional audio|professional audio equipment]], is [[Direct current|DC]] electric [[Electric power|power]] transmitted through [[microphone]] cables to operate microphones that contain active electronic circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;David Miles Huber, Robert E. Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;
It is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.

[[File:Oktava319.jpg|thumb|upright| A [[condenser microphone]] requires power to produce a DC polarizing voltage and to power an internal amplifier required to drive long cables]]
Phantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.

==History==
Phantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9–12 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support "negative phantom" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.

In 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] of Berlin, Germany, presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.

==Standards==
The International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's "Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability" (IEC 61938:2013) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|title=IEC 61938:2013 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48. In addition, two additional variants (P12L and SP48) are mentioned for specialized applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prosoundtraining.com/2012/09/07/battery-powered-phantom-power-supplies/|title=Battery Powered Phantom Power Supplies|date=2012-09-07|work=Prosoundtraining|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KApvYcQkY_gC|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround - A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|last=Rayburn|first=Ray A.|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136118135|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most microphones now use the P48 standard (maximum available power is 240&amp;nbsp;mW). Although 12 and 48 volt systems are still in use, the standard recommends 24 volt supply for new systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.15572.2005|title=IS 15572: Audio, Video and Audiovisual Systems - Interconnections and Matching Values - Preferred Matching Values of Analogue Signlas|last=Bureau of Indian Standards|date=2005-01-01|language=English|quote=This Indian Standard which is identical with lEC 61938 (1996) ...

==Technical information==
Phantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Injection.png|thumb|right| One method of supplying phantom power. A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for "P48" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]

With phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as "parallel powering" or "T-powering" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.

The IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|kΩ]] for 48 V, 1.2 kΩ for 24 V, and 680 Ω for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&amp;nbsp;kΩ value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%&lt;ref&gt;http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.
[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]

Many mixer boards have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, or on smaller mixers all mic channels can be either on or off, also this can be done in groups in most mid-range boards and some smaller ones. If it is desired to disconnect phantom power from one channel only, this can be done by using a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.

[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.

==Caveats==
Some microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.

Phantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&amp;nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.

Mid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2–4&amp;nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4–5&amp;nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC ("Colette") series and Josephson microphones, 5–6&amp;nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&amp;nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&amp;nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&amp;nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).

Most [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.

There is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR.

==Digital phantom power==
Digital microphones complying with the [[Audio Engineering Society|AES 42]] standard may be provided with phantom power at 10 volts, impressed on both audio leads and ground.  This supply can furnish up to 250 mA to digital microphones. A keyed variation of the usual [[XLR connector]], the [[XLD connector]], may be used to prevent accidental interchange of analog and digital devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Francis Rumsey |author2=John Watkinson |title=Digital interface handbook third edition |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |ISBN=0-240-51909-4 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other microphone powering techniques==
T-power, also known as A-B powering&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or T12, described in DIN 45595, is an alternative to phantom powering that is still widely used in the world of production film sound. Many mixers and recorders intended for that market have a T-power option. Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T powered microphones. There is often no audible difference between microphones featuring this method and microphones with P48 powering. In this scheme, 12 volts is applied through 180 ohm resistors between the microphone's "hot" terminal (XLR pin 2) and the microphone's "cold" terminal (XLR pin 3). This results in a 12 volt potential difference with significant current capability across pins 2 and 3, which would likely cause permanent damage if applied to a dynamic or ribbon microphone.

Plug-in-power (PiP), is the low-current 3&amp;nbsp;V to 5&amp;nbsp;V supply provided at the microphone jack of some consumer equipment, such as portable recorders and computer [[sound card]]s. It is also defined in IEC 61938.&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlike phantom power since it is an unbalanced interface with a low voltage (around +5 volts) connected to the signal conductor with return through the sleeve; the DC power is in common with the audio signal from the microphone. A Capacitor is used to block the DC from subsequent audio frequency circuits.  It is often used for powering [[electret microphone]]s, which will not function without power. It is suitable only for powering microphones specifically designed for use with this type of power supply. Damage may result if these microphones are connected to true (48&amp;nbsp;V) phantom power through a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm to XLR adapter that connects the XLR shield to the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microphone-data.com/media/filestore/articles/Powering%20mics-10.pdf Chris Woolf ''Powering Microphones'', retrieved 2013 April 28&lt;/ref&gt; Plug-in-power is covered by Japanese standard CP-1203A:2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeita.or.jp/cgi-bin/standard_e/list.cgi?cateid=1&amp;subcateid=6|title=JEITA / JEITA Standards / AV&amp;IT Technology Standardization / Interface|website=www.jeita.or.jp|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar line-powering scheme is found in computer sound cards. Both plug-in-power and soundcard power are defined in the second edition of IEC 61938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|title=IEC 61938:2013 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative powering schemes are sometimes improperly referred to as "phantom power" and should not be confused with true 48-volt phantom powering described above.

Some condenser microphones can be powered with a 1.5 volt cell contained in a small compartment in the microphone or in an external housing.

Phantom power is sometimes used by workers in [[avionics]] to describe the DC bias voltage used to power aviation microphones, which use a lower voltage than professional audio microphones.  Phantom power used in this context is 8 to 16 volts DC in series with a 470 ohm (nominal) resistor as specified in [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA Inc.]] standard DO-214.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtca.org/ RTCA DO-214&lt;/ref&gt; These microphones evolved from the [[carbon microphone]]s used in the early days of aviation and the telephone which relied on a DC bias voltage across the carbon microphone element.

'''Recursion''' in [[computer science]] is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to [[Iteration#Computing|iteration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Most computer [[programming language]]s support recursion by allowing a [[function (computer science)|function]] to call itself from within its own code. Some [[functional programming]] languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to repeatedly call code. [[Computability theory]] proves that these recursive-only languages are [[turing completeness|Turing complete]]; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as {{code|while}} and {{code|for}}.
{{toclimit|3}}

==Recursive functions and algorithms==
A common [[computer programming]] tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the [[divide-and-conquer method]]; when combined with a [[lookup table]] that stores the results of solving sub-problems (to avoid solving them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time), it can be referred to as [[dynamic programming]] or [[memoization]].

A recursive function definition has one or more ''base cases'', meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]]ly (without recurring), and one or more ''recursive cases'', meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself).  For example, the [[factorial]] function can be defined recursively by the equations {{math|1=0! = 1}} and, for all {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|1=''n''! = ''n''(''n'' − 1)!}}. Neither equation by itself constitutes a complete definition; the first is the base case, and the second is the recursive case. Because the base case breaks the chain of recursion, it is sometimes also called the "terminating case".

The job of the recursive cases can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones.  In a properly designed recursive function, with each recursive call, the input problem must be simplified in such a way that eventually the base case must be reached.  (Functions that are not intended to terminate under normal circumstances—for example, some [[Daemon (computer software)|system and server processes]]—are an exception to this.)  Neglecting to write a base case, or testing for it incorrectly, can cause an [[infinite loop]].

For some functions (such as one that computes the [[series (mathematics)|series]] for {{math|1=''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...}}) there is not an obvious base case implied by the input data; for these one may add a [[parameter]] (such as the number of terms to be added, in our series example) to provide a 'stopping criterion' that establishes the base case. Such an example is more naturally treated by co-recursion, where successive terms in the output are the partial sums; this can be converted to a recursion by using the indexing parameter to say "compute the ''n''th term (''n''th partial sum)".

==Recursive data types==
Many [[computer program]]s must process or generate an arbitrarily large quantity of [[data]].  Recursion is one technique for representing data whose exact size the [[programmer]] does not know: the programmer can specify this data with a [[Self reference|self-referential]] definition.  There are two types of self-referential definitions: inductive and [[Coinduction|coinductive]] definitions.

{{further|Algebraic data type}}

===Inductively defined data===
{{main|Recursive data type}}

An inductively defined recursive data definition is one that specifies how to construct instances of the data.  For example, [[linked list]]s can be defined inductively (here, using [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] syntax):

:&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;data ListOfStrings = EmptyList | Cons String ListOfStrings&lt;/source&gt;

The code above specifies a list of strings to be either empty, or a structure that contains a string and a list of strings.  The self-reference in the definition permits the construction of lists of any (finite) number of strings.

Another example of inductive [[definition]] is the [[natural numbers]] (or positive [[integers]]):

:&lt;code&gt;A natural number is either 1 or n+1, where n is a natural number.&lt;/code&gt;

Similarly recursive [[definition]]s are often used to model the structure of [[expression (programming)|expressions]] and [[statement (programming)|statements]] in programming languages.  Language designers often express grammars in a syntax such as [[Backus–Naur form]]; here is such a grammar, for a simple language of arithmetic expressions with multiplication and addition:

&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt;
 &lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt;
          | (&lt;expr&gt; * &lt;expr&gt;)
          | (&lt;expr&gt; + &lt;expr&gt;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This says that an expression is either a number, a product of two expressions, or a sum of two expressions.  By recursively referring to expressions in the second and third lines, the grammar permits arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions such as &lt;code&gt;(5 * ((3 * 6) + 8))&lt;/code&gt;, with more than one product or sum operation in a single expression.

===Coinductively defined data and corecursion===
{{main|Coinduction|Corecursion}}
A coinductive data definition is one that specifies the operations that may be performed on a piece of data; typically, self-referential coinductive definitions are used for data structures of infinite size.

A coinductive definition of infinite [[stream (computer science)|streams]] of strings, given informally, might look like this:

 A stream of strings is an object s such that:
  head(s) is a string, and
  tail(s) is a stream of strings.

This is very similar to an inductive definition of lists of strings; the difference is that this definition specifies how to access the contents of the data structure—namely, via the [[accessor]] functions &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;—and what those contents may be, whereas the inductive definition specifies how to create the structure and what it may be created from.

[[Corecursion]] is related to coinduction, and can be used to compute particular instances of (possibly) infinite objects.  As a programming technique, it is used most often in the context of [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] programming languages, and can be preferable to recursion when the desired size or precision of a program's output is unknown.  In such cases the program requires both a definition for an infinitely large (or infinitely precise) result, and a mechanism for taking a finite portion of that result.  The problem of computing the first n [[prime numbers]] is one that can be solved with a corecursive program (e.g. [[Fold (higher-order function)#Examples|here]]).

==Types of recursion==

===Single recursion and multiple recursion===
Recursion that only contains a single self-reference is known as '''{{visible anchor|single recursion}}''', while recursion that contains multiple self-references is known as '''{{visible anchor|multiple recursion}}'''. Standard examples of single recursion include list traversal, such as in a linear search, or computing the factorial function, while standard examples of multiple recursion include [[tree traversal]], such as in a depth-first search.

Single recursion is often much more efficient than multiple recursion, and can generally be replaced by an iterative computation, running in linear time and requiring constant space. Multiple recursion, by contrast, may require exponential time and space, and is more fundamentally recursive, not being able to be replaced by iteration without an explicit stack.

Multiple recursion can sometimes be converted to single recursion (and, if desired, thence to iteration). For example, while computing the Fibonacci sequence naively is multiple iteration, as each value requires two previous values, it can be computed by single recursion by passing two successive values as parameters. This is more naturally framed as corecursion, building up from the initial values, tracking at each step two successive values – see [[Corecursion#Examples|corecursion: examples]]. A more sophisticated example is using a [[threaded binary tree]], which allows iterative tree traversal, rather than multiple recursion.

===Indirect recursion===
{{main|Mutual recursion}}

Most basic examples of recursion, and most of the examples presented here, demonstrate {{anchor|direct recursion}}'''''direct'' recursion''', in which a function calls itself.  ''Indirect'' recursion occurs when a function is called not by itself but by another function that it called (either directly or indirectly). For example, if ''f'' calls ''f,'' that is direct recursion, but if ''f'' calls ''g'' which calls ''f,'' then that is indirect recursion of ''f.'' Chains of three or more functions are possible; for example, function 1 calls function 2, function 2 calls function 3, and function 3 calls function 1 again.

Indirect recursion is also called [[mutual recursion]], which is a more symmetric term, though this is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion. That is, if ''f'' calls ''g'' and then ''g'' calls ''f,'' which in turn calls ''g'' again, from the point of view of ''f'' alone, ''f'' is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of ''g'' alone, it is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, ''f'' and ''g'' are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions.

===Anonymous recursion===
{{main|Anonymous recursion}}

Recursion is usually done by explicitly calling a function by name. However, recursion can also be done via implicitly calling a function based on the current context, which is particularly useful for [[anonymous function]]s, and is known as [[anonymous recursion]].

===Structural versus generative recursion===
{{see also|Structural recursion}}

Some authors classify recursion as either "structural" or "generative".  The distinction is related to where a recursive procedure gets the data that it works on, and how it processes that data:

{{quote|text=[Functions that consume structured data] typically decompose their arguments into their immediate structural components and then process those components. If one of the immediate components belongs to the same class of data as the input, the function is recursive. For that reason, we refer to these functions as (STRUCTURALLY) RECURSIVE  FUNCTIONS.|author=Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnaurthi|source=''[[How to Design Programs]]'', 2001&lt;ref name="Felleisen HtDP 2001"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the defining characteristic of a structurally recursive function is that the argument to each recursive call is the content of a field of the original input.  Structural recursion includes nearly all tree traversals, including XML processing, binary tree creation and search, etc. By considering the algebraic structure of the natural numbers (that is, a natural number is either zero or the successor of a natural number), functions such as factorial may also be regarded as structural recursion.

'''{{visible anchor|Generative recursion}}''' is the alternative:

{{quote|text=Many well-known recursive algorithms generate an entirely new piece of data from the given data and recur on it.  [[How to Design Programs|''HtDP'' (''How to Design Programs'')]] refers to this kind as generative recursion.

This distinction is important in [[Termination analysis#Termination proof|proving termination]] of a function. 
* All structurally recursive functions on finite ([[Recursive data type|inductively defined]]) data structures can easily be shown to terminate, via [[structural induction]]: intuitively, each recursive call receives a smaller piece of input data, until a base case is reached. 
* Generatively recursive functions, in contrast, do not necessarily feed smaller input to their recursive calls, so proof of their termination is not necessarily as simple, and avoiding [[infinite loops]] requires greater care. These generatively recursive functions can often be interpreted as corecursive functions – each step generates the new data, such as successive approximation in Newton's method – and terminating this corecursion requires that the data eventually satisfy some condition, which is not necessarily guaranteed.
* In terms of [[loop variant]]s, structural recursion is when there is an obvious loop variant, namely size or complexity, which starts off finite and decreases at each recursive step. 
* By contrast, generative recursion is when there is not such an obvious loop variant, and termination depends on a function, such as "error of approximation" that does not necessarily decrease to zero, and thus termination is not guaranteed without further analysis.

==Recursive programs==

===Recursive procedures===

====Factorial====
A classic example of a recursive procedure is the function used to calculate the [[factorial]] of a [[natural number]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{fact}(n) =
 \begin{cases}
 1 &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
 n \cdot \operatorname{fact}(n-1) &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Pseudocode]] (recursive):
|-
|
 '''function''' factorial is:&lt;br /&gt;
 '''input''': integer ''n'' such that ''n'' &gt;= 0&lt;br /&gt;
 '''output''': [''n'' × (''n''-1) × (''n''-2) × … × 1]
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. if ''n'' is 0, '''return''' 1
     2. otherwise, '''return''' [ ''n'' × factorial(''n''-1) ]
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' factorial
|}

The function can also be written as a [[recurrence relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = nb_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
This evaluation of the recurrence relation demonstrates the computation that would be performed in evaluating the pseudocode above:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Computing the recurrence relation for n = 4:
|-
|
 b&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;           = 4 * b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
              = 4 * (3 * b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * 1)))
              = 4 * (3 * (2 * 1))
              = 4 * (3 * 2)
              = 4 * 6
              = 24
|}

This factorial function can also be described without using recursion by making use of the typical looping constructs found in imperative programming languages:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pseudocode (iterative):
|-
|
 '''function''' factorial is:&lt;br /&gt;
 '''input''': integer ''n'' such that ''n'' &gt;= 0&lt;br /&gt;
 '''output''': [''n'' × (''n''-1) × (''n''-2) × … × 1]
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. '''create''' new variable called ''running_total'' with a value of 1
 &lt;br /&gt;
     2. '''begin''' loop
           1. if ''n'' is 0, '''exit''' loop
           2. '''set''' ''running_total'' to (''running_total'' × ''n'')
           3. '''decrement''' ''n''
           4. '''repeat''' loop
 &lt;br /&gt;
     3. '''return''' ''running_total''
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' factorial
|}

The imperative code above is equivalent to this mathematical definition using an accumulator variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}}'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\operatorname{fact}(n) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n, 1) \\
\operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n, t) &amp; = &amp;
 \begin{cases}
 t &amp; \mbox{if } n = 0 \\
 \operatorname{fact_{acc}}(n-1, nt) &amp; \mbox{if } n &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The definition above translates straightforwardly to [[functional programming language]]s such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]; this is an example of iteration implemented recursively.

====Greatest common divisor====
The [[Euclidean algorithm]], which computes the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers, can be written recursively.

''
Function definition'':
:&lt;math&gt; \gcd(x,y) =
 \begin{cases}
 x &amp; \mbox{if } y = 0 \\
 \gcd(y, \operatorname{remainder}(x,y)) &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; 0 \\
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Pseudocode]] (recursive):
|-
|
 '''function''' gcd is:
 '''input''': integer ''x'', integer ''y'' such that ''x'' &gt; 0 and ''y'' &gt;= 0
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. if ''y'' is 0, '''return''' ''x''
     2. otherwise, '''return''' [ gcd( ''y'', (remainder of ''x''/''y'') ) ]
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' gcd
|}

[[Recurrence relation]] for greatest common divisor, where &lt;math&gt;x \% y&lt;/math&gt; expresses the [[remainder]] of &lt;math&gt;x / y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(x,y) = \gcd(y, x \% y)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;y \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(x,0) = x&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Computing the recurrence relation for x = 27 and y = 9:
|-
|
 gcd(27, 9)   = gcd(9, 27% 9)
              = gcd(9, 0)
              = 9
|-
! Computing the recurrence relation for x = 111 and y = 259:
|-
|
 gcd(111, 259)   = gcd(259, 111% 259)
                 = gcd(259, 111)
                 = gcd(111, 259% 111)
                 = gcd(111, 37)
                 = gcd(37, 111% 37)
                 = gcd(37, 0)
                 = 37
|}

The recursive program above is [[tail-recursive]]; it is equivalent to an iterative algorithm, and the computation shown above shows the steps of evaluation that would be performed by a language that eliminates tail calls.  Below is a version of the same algorithm using explicit iteration, suitable for a language that does not eliminate tail calls.  By maintaining its state entirely in the variables ''x'' and ''y'' and using a looping construct, the program avoids making recursive calls and growing the call stack.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pseudocode (iterative):
|-
|
 '''function''' gcd is:&lt;br /&gt;
 '''input''': integer ''x'', integer ''y'' such that ''x'' &gt;= ''y'' and ''y'' &gt;= 0
 &lt;br /&gt;
     1. '''create''' new variable called ''remainder''
 &lt;br /&gt;
     2. '''begin''' loop
           1. if ''y'' is zero, '''exit''' loop
           2. '''set''' ''remainder'' to the remainder of x/y
           3. '''set''' x to y
           4. '''set''' y to ''remainder''
           5. '''repeat''' loop
 &lt;br /&gt;
     3. '''return''' ''x''
 &lt;br /&gt;
 '''end''' gcd
|}

The iterative algorithm requires a temporary variable, and even given knowledge of the Euclidean algorithm it is more difficult to understand the process by simple inspection, although the two algorithms are very similar in their steps.

====Binary search====
The [[binary search]] algorithm is a method of searching a [[sorted array]] for a single element by cutting the array in half with each recursive pass.  The trick is to pick a midpoint near the center of the array, compare the data at that point with the data being searched and then responding to one of three possible conditions: the data is found at the midpoint, the data at the midpoint is greater than the data being searched for, or the data at the midpoint is less than the data being searched for.

Recursion is used in this algorithm because with each pass a new array is created by cutting the old one in half.  The binary search procedure is then called recursively, this time on the new (and smaller) array.  Typically the array's size is adjusted by manipulating a beginning and ending index.  The algorithm exhibits a logarithmic order of growth because it essentially divides the problem domain in half with each pass.

Example implementation of binary search in C:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
 /*
  Call binary_search with proper initial conditions.

  INPUT:
    data is an array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order,
    toFind is the integer to search for,
    count is the total number of elements in the array

  OUTPUT:
    result of binary_search

 */
 int search(int *data, int toFind, int count)
 {
    //  Start = 0 (beginning index)
    //  End = count - 1 (top index)
    return binary_search(data, toFind, 0, count-1);
 }

 /*
   Binary Search Algorithm.

   INPUT:
        data is a array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order,
        toFind is the integer to search for,
        start is the minimum array index,
        end is the maximum array index
   OUTPUT:
        position of the integer toFind within array data,
        -1 if not found
 */
 int binary_search(int *data, int toFind, int start, int end)
 {
    //Get the midpoint.
    int mid = start + (end - start)/2;   //Integer division

    //Stop condition.
    if (start &gt; end)
       return -1;
    else if (data[mid] == toFind)        //Found?
       return mid;
    else if (data[mid] &gt; toFind)         //Data is greater than toFind, search lower half
       return binary_search(data, toFind, start, mid-1);
    else                                 //Data is less than toFind, search upper half
       return binary_search(data, toFind, mid+1, end);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Recursive data structures (structural recursion)===
{{main|Recursive data type}}

An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as [[list (abstract data type)|lists]] and [[tree (data structure)|trees]].  Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to a theoretically infinite size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, the size of a static array must be set at compile time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Recursive algorithms are particularly appropriate when the underlying problem or the data to be treated are defined in recursive terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The examples in this section illustrate what is known as "structural recursion".  This term refers to the fact that the recursive procedures are acting on data that is defined recursively.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As long as a programmer derives the template from a data definition, functions employ structural recursion. That is, the recursions in a function's body consume some immediate piece of a given compound value.&lt;ref name="Felleisen 2002 108"&gt;{{Cite book

Below is a C definition of a linked list node structure.  Notice especially how the node is defined in terms of itself.  The "next" element of ''struct node'' is a pointer to another ''struct node'', effectively creating a list type.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
struct node
{
  int data;           // some integer data
  struct node *next;  // pointer to another struct node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the ''struct node'' data structure is defined recursively, procedures that operate on it can be implemented naturally as recursive procedures.  The ''list_print'' procedure defined below walks down the list until the list is empty (i.e., the list pointer has a value of NULL).  For each node it prints the data element (an integer).  In the C implementation, the list remains unchanged by the ''list_print'' procedure.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
void list_print(struct node *list)
{
    if (list != NULL)               // base case
    {
       printf ("%d ", list-&gt;data);  // print integer data followed by a space
       list_print (list-&gt;next);     // recursive call on the next node
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Binary trees====
{{main|Binary tree}}

Below is a simple definition for a binary tree node.  Like the node for linked lists, it is defined in terms of itself, recursively.  There are two self-referential pointers: left (pointing to the left sub-tree) and right (pointing to the right sub-tree).
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
struct node
{
  int data;            // some integer data
  struct node *left;   // pointer to the left subtree
  struct node *right;  // point to the right subtree
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Operations on the tree can be implemented using recursion.  Note that because there are two self-referencing pointers (left and right), tree operations may require two recursive calls:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Test if tree_node contains i; return 1 if so, 0 if not.
int tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return 0;  // base case
    else if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return 1;
    else
        return tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;left, i) || tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;right, i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
At most two recursive calls will be made for any given call to ''tree_contains'' as defined above.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Inorder traversal:
void tree_print(struct node *tree_node) {
        if (tree_node != NULL) {                  // base case
                tree_print(tree_node-&gt;left);      // go left
                printf("%d ", tree_node-&gt;data);   // print the integer followed by a space
                tree_print(tree_node-&gt;right);     // go right
        }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example illustrates an [[Tree traversal|in-order traversal]] of the binary tree.  A [[Binary search tree]] is a special case of the binary tree where the data elements of each node are in order.

====Filesystem traversal====
Since the number of files in a [[filesystem]] may vary, [[recursion]] is the only practical way to traverse and thus enumerate its contents.  Traversing a filesystem is very similar to that of [[tree traversal]], therefore the concepts behind tree traversal are applicable to traversing a filesystem.  More specifically, the code below would be an example of a [[preorder traversal]] of a filesystem.

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
import java.io.*;

public class FileSystem {

	public static void main (String [] args) {
		traverse ();
	}

	/**
	 * Obtains the filesystem roots
	 * Proceeds with the recursive filesystem traversal
	 */
	private static void traverse () {
		File [] fs = File.listRoots ();
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; fs.length; i++) {
			if (fs[i].isDirectory () &amp;&amp; fs[i].canRead ()) {
				rtraverse (fs[i]);
			}
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Recursively traverse a given directory
	 *
	 * @param fd indicates the starting point of traversal
	 */
	private static void rtraverse (File fd) {
		File [] fss = fd.listFiles ();

		for (int i = 0; i &lt; fss.length; i++) {
			System.out.println (fss[i]);
			if (fss[i].isDirectory () &amp;&amp; fss[i].canRead ()) {
				rtraverse (fss[i]);
			}
		}
	}

}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code blends the lines, at least somewhat, between recursion and [[iteration]].  It is, essentially, a recursive implementation, which is the best way to traverse a [[filesystem]].  It is also an example of direct and indirect recursion.  The method "rtraverse" is purely a direct example; the method "traverse" is the indirect, which calls "rtraverse".  This example needs no "base case" scenario due to the fact that there will always be some fixed number of files or directories in a given filesystem.

==Implementation issues==
In actual implementation, rather than a pure recursive function (single check for base case, otherwise recursive step), a number of modifications may be made, for purposes of clarity or efficiency. These include:

* Wrapper function (at top)
* Short-circuiting the base case, aka "Arm's-length recursion" (at bottom)
* Hybrid algorithm (at bottom) – switching to a different algorithm once data is small enough

On the basis of elegance, wrapper functions are generally approved, while short-circuiting the base case is frowned upon, particularly in academia. Hybrid algorithms are often used for efficiency, to reduce the overhead of recursion in small cases, and arm's-length recursion is a special case of this.

===Wrapper function===
A [[wrapper function]] is a function that is directly called but does not recurse itself, instead calling a separate auxiliary function which actually does the recursion.

Wrapper functions can be used to validate parameters (so the recursive function can skip these), perform initialization (allocate memory, initialize variables), particularly for auxiliary variables such as "level of recursion" or partial computations for [[memoization]], and handle exceptions and errors. In languages that support [[nested function]]s, the auxiliary function can be nested inside the wrapper function and use a shared scope. In the absence of nested functions, auxiliary functions are instead a separate function, if possible private (as they are not called directly), and information is shared with the wrapper function by using [[pass-by-reference]].

===Short-circuiting the base case===
{{anchor|Arm's-length recursion}}
Short-circuiting the base case, also known as '''arm's-length recursion''', consists of checking the base case ''before'' making a recursive call – i.e., checking if the next call will be the base case, instead of calling and then checking for the base case. Short-circuiting is particularly done for efficiency reasons, to avoid the overhead of a function call that immediately returns. Note that since the base case has already been checked for (immediately before the recursive step), it does not need to be checked for separately, but one does need to use a wrapper function for the case when the overall recursion starts with the base case itself. For example, in the factorial function, properly the base case is 0! = 1, while immediately returning 1 for 1! is a short-circuit, and may miss 0; this can be mitigated by a wrapper function.

Short-circuiting is primarily a concern when many base cases are encountered, such as Null pointers in a tree, which can be linear in the number of function calls, hence significant savings for {{math|''O''(''n'')}} algorithms; this is illustrated below for a depth-first search. Short-circuiting on a tree corresponds to considering a leaf (non-empty node with no children) as the base case, rather than considering an empty node as the base case. If there is only a single base case, such as in computing the factorial, short-circuiting provides only {{math|''O''(1)}} savings.

Conceptually, short-circuiting can be considered to either have the same base case and recursive step, only checking the base case before the recursion, or it can be considered to have a different base case (one step removed from standard base case) and a more complex recursive step, namely "check valid then recurse", as in considering leaf nodes rather than Null nodes as base cases in a tree. Because short-circuiting has a more complicated flow, compared with the clear separation of base case and recursive step in standard recursion, it is often considered poor style, particularly in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth-first search====
A basic example of short-circuiting is given in [[depth-first search]] (DFS) of a binary tree; see [[#Binary trees|binary trees]] section for standard recursive discussion.

The standard recursive algorithm for a DFS is:

* base case: If current node is Null, return false
* recursive step: otherwise, check value of current node, return true if match, otherwise recurse on children
In short-circuiting, this is instead:
* check value of current node, return true if match,
* otherwise, on children, if not Null, then recurse.

In terms of the standard steps, this moves the base case check ''before'' the recursive step. Alternatively, these can be considered a different form of base case and recursive step, respectively. Note that this requires a wrapper function to handle the case when the tree itself is empty (root node is Null).

In the case of a [[perfect binary tree]] of height ''h,'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1 nodes and 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''+1&lt;/sup&gt; Null pointers as children (2 for each of the 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; leaves), so short-circuiting cuts the number of function calls in half in the worst case.

In C, the standard recursive algorithm may be implemented as:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
bool tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return false;  // base case
    else if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return true;
    else
        return tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;left, i) ||
               tree_contains(tree_node-&gt;right, i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The short-circuited algorithm may be implemented as:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Wrapper function to handle empty tree
bool tree_contains(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node == NULL)
        return false;  // empty tree
    else
        return tree_contains_do(tree_node, i);  // call auxiliary function
}

// Assumes tree_node != NULL
bool tree_contains_do(struct node *tree_node, int i) {
    if (tree_node-&gt;data == i)
        return true;  // found
    else  // recurse
        return (tree_node-&gt;left  &amp;&amp; tree_contains_do(tree_node-&gt;left,  i)) ||
               (tree_node-&gt;right &amp;&amp; tree_contains_do(tree_node-&gt;right, i));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the use of [[short-circuit evaluation]] of the Boolean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (AND) operators, so that the recursive call is only made if the node is valid (non-Null). Note that while the first term in the AND is a pointer to a node, the second term is a bool, so the overall expression evaluates to a bool. This is a common idiom in recursive short-circuiting. This is in addition to the short-circuit evaluation of the Boolean || (OR) operator, to only check the right child if the left child fails. In fact, the entire [[control flow]] of these functions can be replaced with a single Boolean expression in a return statement, but legibility suffers at no benefit to efficiency.

===Hybrid algorithm===
Recursive algorithms are often inefficient for small data, due to the overhead of repeated function calls and returns. For this reason efficient implementations of recursive algorithms often start with the recursive algorithm, but then switch to a different algorithm when the input becomes small. An important example is [[merge sort]], which is often implemented by switching to the non-recursive [[insertion sort]] when the data is sufficiently small, as in the [[tiled merge sort]]. Hybrid recursive algorithms can often be further refined, as in [[Timsort]], derived from a hybrid merge sort/insertion sort.

==Recursion versus iteration==
Recursion and [[iteration]] are equally expressive: recursion can be replaced by iteration with an explicit [[call stack]], while iteration can be replaced with [[tail call|tail recursion]]. Which approach is preferable depends on the problem under consideration and the language used. In [[imperative programming]], iteration is preferred, particularly for simple recursion, as it avoids the overhead of function calls and call stack management, but recursion is generally used for multiple recursion. By contrast, in [[functional programming|functional languages]] recursion is preferred, with tail recursion optimization leading to little overhead. Implementing an algorithm using iteration may not be easily achievable.

Compare the templates to compute x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; defined by x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = f(n, x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;) from x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;:
{|
|-
|   
 function recursive(n)
     if n==base
         return x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;
     else
         return f(n, recursive(n-1)) 
||
 function iterative(n)
     x = x&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;
     for i = n downto base
         x = f(i, x)
     return x
|}

For imperative language the overhead is to define the function, for functional language the overhead is to define the accumulator variable x.

For example, a [[factorial]] function may be implemented iteratively in [[C (programming language)|C]] by assigning to an loop index variable and accumulator variable, rather than by passing arguments and returning values by recursion:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
  unsigned int product = 1; // empty product is 1
  while (n) {
    product *= n;
    --n;
  }
  return product;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Expressive power===
Most [[programming language]]s in use today allow the direct specification of recursive functions and procedures. When such a function is called, the program's [[runtime environment]] keeps track of the various [[Instance (computer science)|instance]]s of the function (often using a [[call stack]], although other methods may be used). Every recursive function can be transformed into an iterative function by replacing recursive calls with [[Control flow|iterative control constructs]] and simulating the call stack with a [[stack (data structure)|stack explicitly managed]] by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Python Algorithms: Mastering Basic Algorithms in the Python Language|first=Magnus Lie|last=Hetland|publisher=Apress|year=2010|isbn=9781430232384|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cytGpIPYsAC&amp;pg=PA79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Data Structures and Algorithms in C++|first=Adam|last=Drozdek|edition=4th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781285415017|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRgLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, all iterative functions and procedures that can be evaluated by a computer (see [[Turing completeness]]) can be expressed in terms of recursive functions; iterative control constructs such as [[while loop]]s and [[do loop]]s are routinely rewritten in recursive form in [[functional language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/loop.pdf |title=The Anatomy of a Loop - A story of scope and control |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |first=Olin |last=Shivers |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lambda the Ultimate |url=http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1014 |title=The Anatomy of a Loop |publisher=Lambda the Ultimate |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice this rewriting depends on [[tail call elimination]], which is not a feature of all languages. [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are notable mainstream languages in which all function calls, including [[tail call]]s, may cause stack allocation that would not occur with the use of looping constructs; in these languages, a working iterative program rewritten in recursive form may [[stack overflow|overflow the call stack]], although tail call elimination may be a feature that is not covered by a language's specification, and different implementations of the same language may differ in tail call elimination capabilities.

===Performance issues===
In languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) that favor iterative looping constructs, there is usually significant time and space cost associated with recursive programs, due to the overhead required to manage the stack and the relative slowness of function calls; in [[functional languages]], a function call (particularly a [[tail call]]) is typically a very fast operation, and the difference is usually less noticeable.

As a concrete example, the difference in performance between recursive and iterative implementations of the "factorial" example above depends highly on the [[compiler]] used. In languages where looping constructs are preferred, the iterative version may be as much as several [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] faster than the recursive one. In functional languages, the overall time difference of the two implementations may be negligible; in fact, the cost of multiplying the larger numbers first rather than the smaller numbers (which the iterative version given here happens to do) may overwhelm any time saved by choosing iteration.

===Stack space===
In some programming languages, the maximum size of the [[call stack]] is much less than the space available in the [[Heap (programming)|heap]], and recursive algorithms tend to require more stack space than iterative algorithms. Consequently, these languages sometimes place a limit on the depth of recursion to avoid [[stack buffer overflow|stack overflow]]s; [[python (programming language)|Python]] is one such language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/sys.html |title=27.1. sys — System-specific parameters and functions — Python v2.7.3 documentation |publisher=Docs.python.org |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the caveat below regarding the special case of [[tail recursion]].

===Vulnerability===
Because recursive algorithms can be subject to stack overflows, they may be vulnerable to [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] or [[malware|malicious]] input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Empirical Way to Tame an Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2014| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-empirical-way-to-t/240169123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some malware specifically targets a program's call stack and takes advantage of the stack's inherently recursive nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mueller| first=Oliver| title=Anatomy of a Stack Smashing Attack and How GCC Prevents It| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2012| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/security/anatomy-of-a-stack-smashing-attack-and-h/240001832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the absence of malware, a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion can be fatal to the program, and [[exception handling]] [[logic]] may not prevent the corresponding [[process (computing)|process]] from being [[process state#Terminated|terminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=.NET Framework Class Library| title=StackOverflowException Class| publisher=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]| year=2018| url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.stackoverflowexception(v=vs.110).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiply recursive problems===
Multiply recursive problems are inherently recursive, because of prior state they need to track. One example is [[tree traversal]] as in [[depth-first search]]; though both recursive and iterative methods are used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Depth First Search (DFS): Iterative and Recursive Implementation| publisher=Techie Delight| year=2018| url=http://www.techiedelight.com/depth-first-search/}}&lt;/ref&gt; they contrast with list traversal and linear search in a list, which is a singly recursive and thus naturally iterative method. Other examples include [[divide-and-conquer algorithm]]s such as [[Quicksort]], and functions such as the [[Ackermann function]]. All of these algorithms can be implemented iteratively with the help of an explicit [[stack (data structure)|stack]], but the programmer effort involved in managing the stack, and the complexity of the resulting program, arguably outweigh any advantages of the iterative solution.

===Refactoring recursion===
Recursive algorithms can be replaced with non-recursive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Mitrovic| first=Ivan| title=Replace Recursion with Iteration| publisher=[[ThoughtWorks]]| url=https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/replaceRecursionWithIteration.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One method for replacing recursive algorithms is to simulate them using [[memory management|heap memory]] in place of [[stack-based memory allocation|stack memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=La| first=Woong Gyu| title=How to replace recursive functions using stack and while-loop to avoid the stack-overflow| publisher=CodeProject| year=2015| url=https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/418776/How-to-replace-recursive-functions-using-stack-and}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to develop a replacement algorithm entirely based on non-recursive methods, which can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Moertel| first=Tom| title=Tricks of the trade: Recursion to Iteration, Part 2: Eliminating Recursion with the Time-Traveling Secret Feature Trick| year=2013| url=http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-05-14-recursive-to-iterative-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recursive algorithms for [[matching wildcards]], such as [[Rich Salz]]' [[wildmat]] algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Salz| first=Rich| title=wildmat.c| publisher=[[GitHub]]| year=1991| url=https://github.com/trevor/transmission/blob/master/libtransmission/wildmat.c}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once typical. Non-recursive algorithms for the same purpose, such as the [[Krauss matching wildcards algorithm]], have been developed to avoid the drawbacks of recursion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2008| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-algorithm/210200888}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have improved only gradually based on techniques such as collecting [[software testing|tests]] and [[profiling (computer programming)|profiling]] performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krauss| first=Kirk J| title=Matching Wildcards: An Improved Algorithm for Big Data| publisher=Develop for Performance| year=2018| url=http://www.developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tail-recursive functions==
Tail-recursive functions are functions in which all recursive calls are [[tail call]]s and hence do not build up any deferred operations. For example, the gcd function (shown again below) is tail-recursive.  In contrast, the factorial function (also below) is '''not''' tail-recursive; because its recursive call is not in tail position, it builds up deferred multiplication operations that must be performed after the final recursive call completes.  With a [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that treats tail-recursive calls as [[goto|jumps]] rather than function calls, a tail-recursive function such as gcd will execute using constant space.  Thus the program is essentially iterative, equivalent to using imperative language control structures like the "for" and "while" loops.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Tail recursion]]:
! Augmenting recursion:
|-
|&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//INPUT: Integers x, y such that x &gt;= y and y &gt; 0
int gcd(int x, int y)
{
  if (y == 0)
     return x;
  else
     return gcd(y, x % y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
//INPUT: n is an Integer such that n &gt;= 0
int fact(int n)
{
   if (n == 0)
      return 1;
   else
      return n * fact(n - 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The significance of tail recursion is that when making a tail-recursive call (or any tail call), the caller's return position need not be saved on the [[call stack]]; when the recursive call returns, it will branch directly on the previously saved return position. Therefore, in languages that recognize this property of tail calls, tail recursion saves both space and time.

==Order of execution==
In the simple case of a function calling itself only once, instructions placed before the recursive call are executed once per recursion before any of the instructions placed after the recursive call. The latter are executed repeatedly after the maximum recursion has been reached. Consider this example:

===Function 1===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void recursiveFunction(int num) {
   printf("%d\n", num);
   if (num &lt; 4)
      recursiveFunction(num + 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Recursive1.svg|350px]]

===Function 2 with swapped lines===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void recursiveFunction(int num) {
   if (num &lt; 4)
      recursiveFunction(num + 1);
   printf("%d\n", num);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Recursive2.svg|350px]]

==Time-efficiency of recursive algorithms==
The [[time complexity|time efficiency]] of recursive algorithms can be expressed in a [[recurrence relation]] of [[Big O notation]].  They can (usually) then be simplified into a single Big-O term.

===Shortcut rule (master theorem)===
{{Main|Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)}}
If the time-complexity of the function is in the form

&lt;Math&gt;T(n) = a \cdot T(n / b) + f(n)&lt;/Math&gt;

Then the Big O of the time-complexity is thus:

* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = O(n ^ { \log_b a - \epsilon})&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant &lt;Math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/Math&gt;, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n ^ {\log_b a})&lt;/Math&gt;
* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = \Theta(n ^ { \log_b a })&lt;/Math&gt;, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n ^ { \log_b a} \log n)&lt;/Math&gt;
* If &lt;Math&gt;f(n) = \Omega(n ^ { \log_b a + \epsilon})&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant &lt;Math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/Math&gt;, and if &lt;Math&gt;a \cdot f(n / b) \leq c \cdot f(n)&lt;/Math&gt; for some constant {{mvar|c}} &amp;lt; 1 and all sufficiently large {{mvar|n}}, then &lt;Math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(f(n))&lt;/Math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} represents the number of recursive calls at each level of recursion, {{mvar|b}} represents by what factor smaller the input is for the next level of recursion (i.e. the number of pieces you divide the problem into), and {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;(''n'')}} represents the work the function does independent of any recursion (e.g. partitioning, recombining) at each level of recursion.

The term '''''scotobiology''''' describes the study of [[biology]] as directly and specifically affected by [[darkness]], as opposed to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of [[light]].

==Overview==
The science of scotobiology gathers together under a single descriptive heading a wide range of approaches to the study of the biology of darkness.  This includes work on the effects of darkness on the behavior and [[metabolism]] of animals, plants, and [[microorganism|microbe]]s.  Some of this work has been going on for over a century, and lays the foundation for understanding the importance of dark [[night skies]], not only for humans but for all biological species.

The great majority of biological systems have evolved in a world of alternating day and night and have become irrevocably adapted to and dependent on the daily and seasonally changing patterns of light and darkness. Light is essential for many biological activities such as [[visual perception|sight]] and [[photosynthesis]].  These are the focus of the science of photobiology. But the presence of uninterrupted periods of darkness, as well as their alternation with light, is just as important to biological behaviour. Scotobiology studies the positive responses of [[systems biology|biological systems]] to the presence of darkness, and not merely the negative effects caused by the absence of light.

==Effects of darkness==
Many of the biological and behavioural activities of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s (including [[bird]]s and [[amphibian]]s), [[insect]]s, and [[microorganism]]s are either adversely affected by [[light pollution]] at night or can only function effectively either during or as the consequence of nightly darkness. Such activities include [[foraging]], [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] and [[social behavior]] in higher animals, amphibians, and insects, which are all affected in various ways if light pollution occurs in their environment.&lt;ref name="goering"/&gt; These are not merely photobiological phenomena; light pollution acts by interrupting critical dark-requiring processes. 
 
But perhaps the most important scotobiological phenomena relate to the regular periodic alternation of light and darkness. These include breeding behavior in a range of animals, the control of [[flower]]ing and the induction of winter [[dormancy]] in many plants, and the operational control of the human [[immune system]]. In many of these biological processes the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light. For example, "short-day" and "long-day" plants are, in fact, "long-night" and "short-night" respectively. That is to say, plants do not measure the length of the light period, but of the dark period.&lt;ref name="bidwell"&gt;Bidwell, R.G.S. 1979. Plant Physiology, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of artificial light pollution &lt;ref name="rich"&gt;"Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting", edited by Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore, Published by Island Press, 2006, 458pp, {{ISBN|1-55963-129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of scotobiology, and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness.

In discussing scotobiology, it is important to remember that darkness (the absence of light) is seldom absolute. An important aspect of any scotobiological phenomenon is the level and quality ([[wavelength]]) of light that is below the threshold of detection for that phenomenon and in any specific organism. This important variable in scotobiological studies is not always properly noted or examined. There are substantial levels of natural light pollution at night, of which [[moonlight]] is usually the strongest.  For example, plants that rely on night length to program their behaviour have the capacity to ignore full moonlight during an otherwise dark night. If this ability had not evolved, plants would not be able to respond to changing night-length for such behavioural programs as the initiation of flowering and the onset of dormancy. On the other hand, some animal behavioural patterns are strongly responsive to moonlight. It is thus most important in any scotobiological study to determine the threshold level of light that may be required to interfere with or negate the normal pattern of [[nocturnality|dark-night activity]].

==Etymology==
In 2003, at a symposium on the [[Ecology]] of the Night held in [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]], [[Canada]], discussion centered around the many effects of night-time [[light pollution]] on the [[biology]] of a wide range of organisms, but it went far beyond this in describing darkness as a biological imperative for the functioning of biological systems.&lt;ref name="goering"&gt;The Ecology of the Night. An International Symposium: Darkness as a Biological Imperative. Muskoka, Canada, 22–24 September 2003; Chair, Peter L.E. Goering. Proceedings are available online at www.muskokaheritage.org/ecology-night/&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations focused on the absolute requirement of darkness for many aspects of normal behaviour and metabolism of many organisms and for the normal progression of their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s. Because there was no suitable term to describe the Symposium's main focus, the term ''scotobiology'' was introduced.  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''scotos'', σκότος, "dark," and relates to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of light (φῶς, ''phos''; root: φωτ-, ''phot-''). The term scotobiology appears not to have been used previously, although related terms such as [[phototropism|skototropism]]&lt;ref name="strong"&gt;Strong, D.R. and Ray, T.S. (1975). Science 190, #4216, pp 804-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and scotophyle&lt;ref name="bunning"&gt;Work of E. Bunning reported in (4), also of K.C. Hamner, reviewed in Evans, L.T. (1963). Environmental Control of Plant Growth, Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared in the literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3582">'''Season cracking''' is a form of [[stress-corrosion cracking]] of [[brass]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge cases]] originally reported from British forces in India. During the [[monsoon]] season, military activity was temporarily reduced, and ammunition was stored in stables until the dry weather returned. Many brass cartridges were subsequently found to be cracked, especially where the case was crimped to the bullet. It was not until 1921 that the phenomenon was explained by Moor, Beckinsale and Mallinson: [[ammonia]] from horse urine, combined with the [[residual stress]] in the cold-drawn metal of the cartridges, was responsible for the cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Moore | first = H. | authorlink = |author2=Beckinsale, S. |author3=Mallinson, C.E.  | title = The Season Cracking of Brass and other Copper Alloys | journal = Journal of the Institute of Metals | volume = XXV | issue = | pages = 59–125 | publisher = | location = | year = 1921 | url = | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BrassSCC1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cracking in brass caused by ammonia attack]]
[[Image:35remsplitneck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[.35 Remington]] cartridge that has experienced season cracking]]
Season cracking is characterised by deep brittle cracks which penetrate into affected components. If the cracks reach a critical size, the component can suddenly fracture, sometimes with disastrous results. However, if the concentration of ammonia is very high, then attack is much more severe, and attack over all exposed surfaces occurs. The problem was solved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the brass cases after forming so as to relieve the residual stresses.
 
==Ammonia==
The attack takes the form of a reaction between [[ammonia]] and [[copper]] to form the [[cuprammonium]] ion, formula [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a chemical complex which is water-soluble, and hence washed from the growing cracks. The problem of cracking can therefore also occur in [[copper]] and any other copper alloy, such as [[bronze]]. The tendency of copper to react with ammonia was exploited in making [[rayon]], and the deep blue colour of the aqueous solution of [[copper(II) oxide]] in ammonia is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]].{{huh|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- the linked article says it uses copper hydroxide, not copper oxide--&gt;

==Materials==
Although the problem was first found in brass, any alloy containing [[copper]] will be susceptible to the problem. It includes copper itself (as used in pipe for example), [[bronze]]s and other alloys with a significant copper content.

== John Cook ''et al.'', 2013 ==

Cook ''et al.'' examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991–2011 that matched the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013" /&gt; They found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW, 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"/&gt;

In their discussion of the results in 2007, the authors said that the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW is as expected in a consensus situation,&lt;ref name="Oreskes_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oreskes|first=Naomi|title=Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=72|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/resources/globalwarming/oreskes-chapter-4.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2013|chapter=The scientific consensus on climate change: how do we know we're not wrong?|quote=[Scientists] generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics."&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John |author2=Dana Nuccitelli |author3=Sarah A Green |author4=Mark Richardson |author5=Bärbel Winkler |author6=Rob Painting |author7=Robert Way |author8=Peter Jacobs |author9=Andrew Skuce|title=Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=May 2013|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]]|authorlink=John Cook (Australian scientist)|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Education'' in August 2013 [[David Legates]] and three coauthors reviewed the corpus used by Cook ''et al.'' In their assessment, "inspection of a claim by Cook ''et al.'' (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1% consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3% endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic."

However, as the paper took issue in the definition of consensus, the definition of consensus was split into several levels: In the end, of all the abstracts that took a position on the subject, 22.97% and 72.50% were found to take an explicit but unquantified endorsement position or an implicit endorsement position, respectively.  The 0.3% figure represents abstracts taking a position of "Actually endorsing the standard definition" of all the abstracts (1.02% of all position-taking abstracts), where the "standard definition" was juxtaposed with an "unquantified definition" drawn from the 2013 Cook ''et al.'' paper as follows:
* The unquantified definition: "The consensus position that humans are causing global warming" 
* The standard definition: As stated in their introduction, that "human activity is very likely causing most of the current warming (anthropogenic global warming, or AGW)" 
Criticism was also made to the "arbitrary" exclusion of non-position-taking abstracts as well as other issues of definitions.

Wall Street Journal, May 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate economist [[Richard Tol]] has also been a persistent critic of the Cook ''et al.'' paper, arguing that the authors "used an unrepresentative sample, left out much useful data, used biased observers who disagreed with the authors of the papers they were classifying nearly two-thirds of the time, and collected and analysed the data in such a way as to allow the authors to adjust their preliminary conclusions as they went along".&lt;ref&gt;[http://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/06/climate-wars-done-science/ The Climate Wars’ Damage to Science] by [[Matt Ridley]], [[Quadrant magazine]],  June 19th 2015. Ridley credits [[Joanne Nova]] for this summary of Tol's views.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook ''et al.'' replied to Tol's criticisms, pointing out that "the 97% consensus has passed peer-review, while Tol's criticisms have not".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-robust.htm The Cook et al.

Benestad, Dana Nuccitelli, Stephan Lewandowsky, Katharine Hayhoe, Hans Olav Hygen, Rob van Dorland, and John Cook examined the quality of the 3% of peer-reviewed papers discovered by this work to reject the consensus view. They discovered that "replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases".

== Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012 ==

Lefsrud and Meyer surveyed members of the [[Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta]] (APEGA), a professional association for the [[petroleum industry]] in [[Alberta]]. The aims of the study included examining the respondents' "legitimation of themselves as experts on 'the truth', and their attitudes towards regulatory measures."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Writing later, the authors added, "we surveyed engineers and geologists because their professions dominate the oil industry and their views on climate change influence the positions taken by governments, think tanks and environmental groups."&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"/&gt;

The authors found that 99.4% agreed that the global climate is changing but that "the debate of the causes of climate change is particularly virulent among them." Analyzing their responses, the authors labelled 36% of respondents 'comply with Kyoto', as "they express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; 'Regulation activists' (10%) "diagnose climate change as being both human- and naturally caused, posing a moderate public risk, with only slight impact on their personal life." Skeptical of anthropogenic warming (sum 51%) they labelled 'nature is overwhelming' (24%), 'economic responsibility' (10%), and 'fatalists' (17%). Respondents giving these responses disagreed in various ways with [[Scientific opinion on climate change|mainstream scientific opinion on climate change]], expressing views such as that climate change is 'natural', that its causes are unknown, that it is harmless, or that regulation such as that represented by [[Kyoto Protocol]] is in itself harmful.&lt;ref name=or&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lefsrud | first1 = L.

They found that respondents that support regulation (46%) ('comply with Kyoto' and 'regulation activists') were "significantly more likely to be lower in the organizational hierarchy, younger, female, and working in government", while those that oppose regulation ('nature is overwhelming' and 'economic responsibility') were "significantly more likely to be more senior in their organizations, male, older, geoscientists, and work in the oil and gas industry".&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Discussing the study in 2013, the authors ask if such political divisions distract decision-makers from confronting the risk that climate change presents to businesses and the economy.&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"&gt;"[http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2013/03/risk-management-approach-could-motivate-climate-change-action/ Risk Management Approach Could Motivate Climate Change Action]", Lianne Lefsrud and Renate Meyer, ''[[Social Science Space]]'', March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Farnsworth and Lichter, 2011 ==

In an October 2011 paper published in the ''[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]'', researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 scientists working in academia, government, and industry. The scientists polled were members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] or the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) and listed in the 23rd edition of [[American Men and Women of Science]] (AGU), a biographical reference work on leading American scientists, and 489 returned completed questionnaires. Of those who replied, 97% agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that "human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring," 5% disagreed, and 12% didn't know.&lt;ref&gt;

The number of climate-relevant [[Scientific literature|publications]] authored or coauthored by each researcher was used to define their 'expertise', and the [[Citation impact|number of citations]] for each of the researcher's four highest-cited papers was used to define their 'prominence'.

The authors of the paper say that their database of researchers "is not comprehensive nor designed to be representative of the entire [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate science community]]," but say that since they drew the researchers from the most high-profile reports and public statements, it is likely that it represents the "strongest and most credentialed" researchers both 'convinced by the evidence' (CE) and 'unconvinced by the evidence' (UE) on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/2010/06/scientists-convinced-climate-consensus-more-prominent-opponents-says-paper Scientists 'Convinced' of Climate Consensus More Prominent Than Opponents, Says Paper] by [[Eli Kintisch]], "Science Insider", [[Science (journal)|Science]], 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey was designed to take less than two minutes to complete. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures had generally risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. 76 out of the 79 respondents who "listed climate science as their area of expertise, and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change", thought that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Of those 79 scientists, 75 out of the 77 answered that human activity was a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures, a sample size which would result in a margin of error of 11 percentage points. The remaining two were not asked, because in question one they responded that temperatures had remained relatively constant. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent respectively thinking that human activity was a significant contributing factor. In summary, Doran and Zimmerman wrote:

The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.&lt;ref name=BvS2010/&gt;

In the section on climate change impacts, questions 20 and 21 were relevant to scientific opinion on climate change.
Question 20, "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?" Answers:  67.1% very much convinced (7), 26.7% to some large extent (5–6), 6.2% said to some small extent (2–4), none said not at all.
Question 21, "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?" Answers:  34.6% very much convinced (7), 48.9% being convinced to a large extent (5–6), 15.1% to a small extent (2–4), and 1.35% not convinced at all (1).&lt;ref name=BvS2010/&gt;

The author analyzed 928 abstracts of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, listed with the keywords "global climate change". Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. 75% of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories, thus either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] climate change; none of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

== Early 2000s ==

In 2003, Bray and von Storch conducted a survey of the perspectives of climate scientists on global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Scientists’ Perceptions of Climate Change Science.|url=https://www.academia.edu/4484361/Climate_Scientists_Perceptions_of_Climate_Change_Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries. The 2003 survey has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. The survey required entry of a username and password, but the username and password were circulated to a climate skeptics mailing list and elsewhere on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Bray and von Storch defended their results and accused climate change skeptics of interpreting the results with bias. Bray's submission to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on December 22, 2004 was rejected.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

One of the questions asked in the survey was ''"To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?"'', with a value of 1 indicating strongly agree and a value of 7 indicating strongly disagree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/08/climate_scientists_views_on_cl_1.html Climate scientists’ views on climate change: a survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed a mean of 3.62, with 50 responses (9.4%) indicating "strongly agree" and 54 responses (9.7%) indicating "strongly disagree". The same survey indicates a 72% to 20% endorsement of the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that ''"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions."''{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== 1990s ==

* In 1997, the conservative think tank [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] surveyed America's 48 [[American Association of State Climatologists|state climatologists]] on questions related to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980525144333/http://www.cse.org/surveyenviroreg100897.htm Citizens For a Sound Economy Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 36 respondents, 44% considered global warming to be a largely natural phenomenon, compared to 17% who considered warming to be largely man-made. 89% agreed that "current science is unable to isolate and measure variations in global temperatures caused ONLY by man-made factors," and 61% said that historical data do not indicate "that fluctuations in global temperatures are attributable to human influences such as burning fossil fuels", though the time scale for the next glacial period was not specified.
* In 1996, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch undertook a survey of climate scientists on attitudes towards global warming and related matters. The results were subsequently published in the [[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="Bray_von_Storch_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281999%29080%3C0439%3ACSAEEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title=Climate Science: An Empirical Example of Postnormal Science | journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society | last=Bray | first=Dennis |author2=[[Hans von Storch]]  | year=1999 | accessdate=2007-09-04|format=PDF | doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1999)080&lt;0439:CSAEEO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume=80 | pages=439–455 | issn=1520-0477 | issue=3|bibcode = 1999BAMS...80..439B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper addressed the views of climate scientists, with a response rate of 40% from a mail survey questionnaire to 1000 scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada. Most of the scientists accepted that global warming was occurring and appropriate policy action should be taken, but there was wide disagreement about the likely effects on society and almost all agreed that the predictive ability of currently existing models was limited. On a scale of 1 (highest confidence) to 7 (lowest confidence) regarding belief in the ability to make "reasonable predictions" the mean was 4.8 and 5.2 for 10- and 100-year predictions, respectively. On the question of whether global warming is occurring or will occur, the mean response was 3.3, and for future prospects of warming the mean was 2.6.
* A [[Gallup poll]] of 400 members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] and the [[American Meteorological Society]] along with an analysis of reporting on global warming by the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], a report on which was issued in 1992. Accounts of the results of that survey differ in their interpretation and even in the basic statistical percentages:
** [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] states that the report said that 67% of the scientists said that human-induced global warming was occurring, with 11% disagreeing and the rest undecided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1307 R. Nixon, "Limbaughesque Science"], citing a press release by Gallup in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[George Will]] reported "53 percent do not believe warming has occurred, and another 30 percent are uncertain." (''Washington Post'', September 3, 1992). In a correction Gallup stated: "Most scientists involved in research in this area believe that human-induced global warming is occurring now."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1156 Steve Rendall, "The Hypocrisy of George Will"], FAIR report, citing the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Esoteric Character of the Gospels'''" is an article published in three parts: in November-December 1887, and in February 1888, in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']]; it was written by [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|''Lucifer,'' Vol. 1, November 1887, p. 173–80; December 1887, p. 299–309; February 1888, p. 490–96.{{sfn|Index}}}} It was included in the 8th volume of the author's ''Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Price|1985}} In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] medal.{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|When the [[Theosophical Society]] was created, the encouraging of "the study of [[comparative religion]], philosophy, and science" was proclaimed his second major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992}}}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Versus clerics ===
An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," has cited her article in which she writes that "[[Christianity]] is now the religion of arrogance ''par excellence,'' a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}} A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] has noted that she did not make secrets out of her "skeptical attitude towards the [[Gospel]]s," considering them unrelated to either [[Jesus]] or his [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=297}}{{refn|group=note|Noting in church Christianity the dogmatism generated by the "painful ambition of its hierarchs," Blavatsky regarded it exclusively as a religious sanctification of "power over people."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=298}}}} Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] camp there are 350 dissenting [[sect]]s, and she commented that if "one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=175|Tyson|2006|2p=384}} A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are "magazines of falsehoods," and all of them have served {{quote|"as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made of their gods blood-thirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1pp=179–80|Фесенкова|2001|2p=18}}}}

Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to "the [[Church Fathers]] or modern priests, pastors and missionaries." The reason for her hostility to church Christianity "was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness." She believed that "churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|ancient wisdom]]."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

=== Historical Jesus ===
A Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls [[Lod|Lüd]] as the "hometown" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of [[Talmud]] that Jesus was the [[Yeshu|son of a man named Pandira]] and "lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events." In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he "was initiated" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the [[Essenes]], who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with "He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of [[Passover]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Дружинин|2012|2p=68}}

=== Chrestos and Christos ===
Drujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and [[Christ (title)|Christos]] (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: "Christ— the true esoteric [[Salvation in Christianity|'''Saviour''']]—is no man, but the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'''Divine Principle''']] in every human being."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Дружинин|2012|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Chrestes''', '''Chrestos''' (Greek). Applied by the Greeks as a title of respect equivalent to 'the worthy.' Chrestes meant an interpreter of oracles. In the language of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mysteries]], a chrestos was a candidate or neophyte, and a christos (anointed) was an initiate. Christ is a mystical expression for the human [[Ātman (Hinduism)|inner god]], while chrest is the good but as yet unregenerated nature."{{sfn|Glossary|1999|loc=Chrestes}}}} Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: "The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=215|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside "all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=205|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} The Russian ''Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians'' wrote that in her article Blavatsky "allegorically" proclaims: "Christos was 'the '''Way''',' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of ''''Truth'''.'"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Беренс|2003|2p=64}} In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To the true follower of the '''Spirit of Truth''', it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=204|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tyson wrote that "sanctification," in Blavatsky's opinion, "was ever the synonym (for) the '[[Mahatma|Mahatmic]]-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=190|Tyson|2006|2p=183}} In this connection, he has said that [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] friars "practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to," as Blavatsky writes, "kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine [[Spirit]] in man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=201|Tyson|2006|2p=183}}

=== Esotericism in the Gospels ===
While studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the "story of Jesus Christ," which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on [[Calvary]]? We say on the authority of the [[esoteric]] Eastern School, that all this came from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], as far as the name [[Christ (title)|Christos]] and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient [[Tannaim|Tanaïm]] as regards the [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=210|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to French philosopher [[Édouard Schuré]], [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]] in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the "[[Essenes|Essenian]] and Gnostic traditions."{{sfn|Schuré|1921}} A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated that the "Gospels" in ancient times were not "the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine [[soul]]s in the mortal body here on earth."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=9}}

== Criticism ==
This article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally.{{sfn|Cranston|1993}} Thus, a priest Drujinin ([[Russian Orthodox Church]]) claimed that the Theosophists "had reduced" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}} And moreover:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The founders of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] deny the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of [[Christ myth theory]], stated that esotericism "hung up midway" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this "anomalous" situation: arguing in one place that "Christ— the true esoteric '''Saviour'''—is no man, but the '''Divine Principle''' in every human being,"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Kuhn|1990|2p=16}} she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the [[Master Jesus|Jewish Adept Jesus]]. Kuhn proclaimed: "The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=17}}

According to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's "onslaughts" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to "good works such as [[the Salvation Army]], were not always even-handed." Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent [[Liberal Christianity|liberal branch of Christian theology]] — "[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], Coleridge, [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], Kingsley and many others" who had nothing to do to the primitive "dogmatism she so hated." Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the [[Theosophical Society]] connected with the formation of a "new spirituality based on an immanent universalism" which opposing [[Religious intolerance|aggressive religiosity]] "she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

'''Two-hybrid screening''' (originally known as '''yeast two-hybrid system''' or '''Y2H''') is a [[molecular biology]] technique used to discover [[protein–protein interaction]]s (PPIs)&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young KH | title = Yeast two-hybrid: so many interactions, (in) so little time | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–11 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9475380 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod58.2.302 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927133205/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DNA-binding protein#Protein–DNA interactions|protein–DNA interactions]]&lt;ref name="joung"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joung JK, Ramm EI, Pabo CO | title = A bacterial two-hybrid selection system for studying protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 13 | pages = 7382–7 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852947 | pmc = 16554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.110149297 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/13/7382 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.7382J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurt JA, Thibodeau SA, Hirsh AS, Pabo CO, Joung JK | title = Highly specific zinc finger proteins obtained by directed domain shuffling and cell-based selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 21 | pages = 12271–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14527993 | pmc = 218748 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2135381100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/21/12271 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..10012271H }}&lt;/ref&gt; by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two [[protein]]s or a single protein and a [[DNA]] molecule, respectively.

The premise behind the test is the activation of [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] [[reporter gene]](s) by the binding of a [[transcription factor]] onto an [[upstream activating sequence]] (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA-binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the [[protein domain|domain]] responsible for [[DNA-binding protein|binding]] to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The Y2H is thus a [[protein-fragment complementation assay]].

== History ==

Pioneered by [[Stanley Fields (biologist)|Stanley Fields]] and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the technique was originally designed to detect protein–protein interactions using the [[Gal4]] transcriptional activator of the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. The [[Gal4]] protein activated transcription of a gene involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection.&lt;ref name="fields"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fields S, Song O | title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions | journal = Nature | volume = 340 | issue = 6230 | pages = 245–6 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2547163 | doi = 10.1038/340245a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6230/abs/340245a0.html;jsessionid=2F9E056F57E5547D17D2D6658C9B0437 | format = abstract | bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F }} Abstract is free; full-text article is not.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different [[#Host organism|host organisms]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or mammalian cells instead of yeast.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premise ==

The key to the two-hybrid screen is that in most [[eukaryotic]] transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding.&lt;ref name="verschure"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verschure PJ, Visser AE, Rots MG | title = Step out of the groove: epigenetic gene control systems and engineered transcription factors | journal = Advances in Genetics | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 163–204 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16735158 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(06)56005-5 | isbn = 9780120176564 | series = Advances in Genetics }} {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected.

The most common screening approach is the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this approach the researcher knows where each prey is located on the used medium (agar plates). Millions of potential interactions in several organisms have been screened in the latest decade using  [[high-throughput screening]] systems (often using robots) and over thousands of interactions have been detected and categorized in databases as [https://thebiogrid.org BioGRID].&lt;ref name="Brückner"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brückner A, Polge C, Lentze N, Auerbach D, Schlattner U | title = Yeast two-hybrid, a powerful tool for systems biology | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 2763–88 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19582228 | pmc = 2705515 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10062763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gietz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gietz RD, Triggs-Raine B, Robbins A, Graham KC, Woods RA | title = Identification of proteins that interact with a protein of interest: applications of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 172 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 67–79 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9278233 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006859319926 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5w6u8667583641p/?p=163f5ecf5cff441b940a429da9d83187&amp;pi=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system often utilizes a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] strain of yeast in which the [[biosynthesis]] of certain nutrients (usually [[amino acid]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. This mutant yeast strain can be made to incorporate foreign DNA in the form of [[plasmid]]s. In yeast two-hybrid screening, separate bait and prey plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the mutant yeast strain or a mating strategy is used to get both plasmids in one host cell.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

The second high-throughput approach is the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

Plasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a [[Library (biology)|library]] of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.

If the bait and prey proteins interact (i.e., bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The challenge of separating cells that express proteins that happen to interact with their counterpart fusion proteins from those that do not, is addressed in the following section.

==Fixed domains==

In any study, some of the protein domains, those under investigation, will be varied according to the goals of the study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as [[Zif268]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4,&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The AD chosen must be able to activate transcription of the reporter gene, using the cell's own transcription machinery. Thus, the variety of ADs available for use in yeast-based techniques may not be suited to use in their bacterial-based analogues. The herpes simplex virus-derived AD, VP16 and yeast Gal4 AD have been used with success in yeast&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; whilst a portion of the α-subunit of ''E. coli'' RNA polymerase has been utilised in ''E. coli''-based methods.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

Whilst powerfully activating domains may allow greater sensitivity towards weaker interactions, conversely, a weaker AD may provide greater stringency.

==Construction of expression plasmids==

A number of engineered genetic sequences must be incorporated into the host cell to perform two-hybrid analysis or one of its derivative techniques. The considerations and methods used in the construction and delivery of these sequences differ according to the needs of the assay and the organism chosen as the experimental background.

There are two broad categories of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A [[cDNA library]] is constituted by the cDNA produced through [[reverse transcription]] of mRNA collected from specific cells of types of cell. This library can be ligated into a construct so that it is attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including [[Site-directed mutagenesis#Cassette mutagenesis|cassette mutagenesis]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate [[restriction endonucleases]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===''E. coli''-specific considerations===

By placing the hybrid proteins under the control of [[IPTG]]-inducible [[lac promoter|''lac'' promoter]]s, they are expressed only on media supplemented with IPTG. Further, by including different antibiotic resistance genes in each genetic construct, the growth of non-transformed cells is easily prevented through culture on media containing the corresponding antibiotics. This is particularly important for counter selection methods in which a ''lack'' of interaction is needed for cell survival.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The reporter gene may be inserted into the ''E. coli'' genome by first inserting it into an [[episome]], a type of plasmid with the ability to incorporate itself into the bacterial cell genome&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; with a copy number of approximately one per cell.&lt;ref name="whipple"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whipple FW | title = Genetic analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 26 | issue = 16 | pages = 3700–6 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9685485 | pmc = 147751 | doi = 10.1093/nar/26.16.3700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid expression phagemids can be electroporated into ''E. coli'' XL-1 Blue cells which after amplification and infection with VCS-M13 [[helper phage]], will yield a stock of library phage. These phage will each contain one single-stranded member of the phagemid library.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Recovery of protein information==

Once the selection has been performed, the [[primary structure]] of the proteins which display the appropriate characteristics must be determined. This is achieved by retrieval of the protein-encoding sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype.

===''E. coli''===

The phagemid used to transform ''E. coli'' cells may be "rescued" from the selected cells by infecting them with VCS-M13 helper phage. The resulting phage particles that are produced contain the single-stranded phagemids and are used to infect XL-1 Blue cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The double-stranded phagemids are subsequently collected from these XL-1 Blue cells, essentially reversing the process used to produce the original library phage. Finally, the DNA sequences are determined through [[dideoxy sequencing]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Controlling sensitivity==

The ''Escherichia coli''-derived [[TetR|Tet-R]] repressor can be used in line with a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) the expression of a previously mentioned reporter such as ''HIS3'', through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be controlled by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for ''his3''-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for ''aadA'' dependent cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Selection-gene-dependency may also be controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole]] (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the ''HIS3''-gene product and may be used to titrate the minimum level of ''HIS3'' expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be modulated by varying the number of operator sequences in the reporter DNA.

==Non-fusion proteins==

A third, non-fusion protein may be co-expressed with two fusion proteins. Depending on the investigation, the third protein may modify one of the fusion proteins or mediate or interfere with their interaction.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Co-expression of the third protein may be necessary for modification or activation of one or both of the fusion proteins. For example, ''S. cerevisiae'' possesses no endogenous tyrosine kinase. If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a tyrosine kinase gene.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The non-fusion protein may mediate the interaction by binding both fusion proteins simultaneously, as in the case of ligand-dependent receptor dimerization.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

For a protein with an interacting partner, its functional homology to other proteins may be assessed by supplying the third protein in non-fusion form, which then may or may not compete with the fusion-protein for its binding partner. Binding between the third protein and the other fusion protein will interrupt the formation of the reporter expression activation complex and thus reduce reporter expression, leading to the distinguishing change in phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid==

One limitation of classic yeast two-hybrid screens is that they are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein–protein interactions between insoluble [[integral membrane protein]]s. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stagljar I, Korostensky C, Johnsson N, te Heesen S | title = A genetic system based on split-ubiquitin for the analysis of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 9 | pages = 5187–92 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560251 | pmc = 20236 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.9.5187 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9560251 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.5187S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the split-ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different [[ubiquitin]] moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Cub", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Nub", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a [[transcription factor]] (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific [[protease]]s. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of [[reporter gene]]s.&lt;ref name="Snider2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snider J, Kittanakom S, Curak J, Stagljar I | title = Split-ubiquitin based membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system: a powerful tool for identifying protein-protein interactions | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 36 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20125081 | pmc = 2818708 | doi = 10.3791/1698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluorescent two-hybrid assay ==
Zolghadr and co-workers presented a fluorescent two-hybrid system that uses two hybrid proteins that are fused to different fluorescent proteins as well as LacI, the [[lac repressor]]. The structure of the fusion proteins looks like this: FP2-LacI-bait and FP1-prey where the bait and prey proteins interact and bring the fluorescent proteins (FP1 = [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], FP2=[[mCherry]]) in close proximity at the binding site of the LacI protein in the host cell genome.&lt;ref name="Zolghadr2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zolghadr K, Mortusewicz O, Rothbauer U, Kleinhans R, Goehler H, Wanker EE, Cardoso MC, Leonhardt H | title = A fluorescent two-hybrid assay for direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 2279–87 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18622019 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M700548-MCP200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can also be used to screen for inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Yurlova2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yurlova L, Derks M, Buchfellner A, Hickson I, Janssen M, Morrison D, Stansfield I, Brown CJ, Ghadessy FJ, Lane DP, Rothbauer U, Zolghadr K, Krausz E | title = The fluorescent two-hybrid assay to screen for protein-protein interaction inhibitors in live cells: targeting the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 and Mdm4 | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Screening | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–25 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24476585 | doi = 10.1177/1087057113518067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enzymatic two-hybrid systems: KISS ==
While the original Y2H system used a reconstituted transcription factor, other systems create enzymatic activities to detect PPIs. For instance, the KInase Substrate Sensor ("KISS"), is a mammalian two-hybrid approach has been designed to map intracellular PPIs. Here, a bait protein  is fused to a [[kinase]]-containing portion of [[TYK2]] and a prey is coupled to a [[gp130]] [[cytokine receptor]] fragment. When bait and prey interact, TYK2 phosphorylates [[STAT3]] docking sites on the prey chimera, which ultimately leads to activation of a [[reporter gene]].&lt;ref name="Lievens2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lievens S, Gerlo S, Lemmens I, De Clercq DJ, Risseeuw MD, Vanderroost N, De Smet AS, Ruyssinck E, Chevet E, Van Calenbergh S, Tavernier J | title = Kinase Substrate Sensor (KISS), a mammalian in situ protein interaction sensor | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 3332–42 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25154561 | pmc = 4256487 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M114.041087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-, three- and one-two-hybrid variants==

===One-hybrid===

The one-hybrid variation of this technique is designed to investigate [[protein–DNA interaction]]s and uses a single fusion protein in which the AD is linked directly to the binding domain. The binding domain in this case however is not necessarily of fixed sequence as in two-hybrid protein–protein analysis but may be constituted by a library. This library can be selected against the desired target sequence, which is inserted in the promoter region of the reporter gene construct. In a positive-selection system, a binding domain that successfully binds the UAS and allows transcription is thus selected.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Note that selection of DNA-binding domains is not necessarily performed using a one-hybrid system, but may also be performed using a two-hybrid system in which the binding domain is varied and the bait and prey proteins are kept constant.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

===Three-hybrid===

[[Image:Three-hybrid-system.svg|thumb|350px|Overview of three-hybrid assay.]]

RNA-protein interactions have been investigated through a three-hybrid variation of the two-hybrid technique. In this case, a hybrid RNA molecule serves to adjoin together the two protein fusion domains—which are not intended to interact with each other but rather the intermediary RNA molecule (through their RNA-binding domains).&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Techniques involving non-fusion proteins that perform a similar function, as described in the 'non-fusion proteins' section above, may also be referred to as three-hybrid methods.

===One-two-hybrid===

Simultaneous use of the one- and two-hybrid methods (that is, simultaneous protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction) is known as a one-two-hybrid approach and expected to increase the stringency of the screen.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Host organism==

Although theoretically, any living cell might be used as the background to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The latter is especially important for doing [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput studies]]. Therefore the yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Tournu H, Tavernier J, Van Dijck P | title = Diversity in genetic in vivo methods for protein-protein interaction studies: from the yeast two-hybrid system to the mammalian split-luciferase system | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 331–82 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22688816 | pmc = 3372256 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.05021-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast cells often do not have the same post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.&lt;ref name="Brückner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamdi A, Colas P | title = Yeast two-hybrid methods and their applications in drug discovery | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–18 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22130009 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2011.10.008 | url = http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/abstract/S0165-6147(11)00195-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''S. cerevisiae''===

The yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' was the model organism used during the two-hybrid technique's inception. It is commonly known as the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

A number of yeast strains have been created specifically for Y2H screens, e.g. [[Y187]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromont-Racine M, Rain JC, Legrain P | title = Toward a functional analysis of the yeast genome through exhaustive two-hybrid screens | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–82 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9207794 | doi = 10.1038/ng0797-277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AH109]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu L, Horstmann H, Ng C, Hong W | title = Regulation of Golgi structure and function by ARF-like protein 1 (Arl1) | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = Pt 24 | pages = 4543–55 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11792819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both produced by [[Takara Holdings|Clontech]].  Yeast strains R2HMet and BK100 have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khadka S, Vangeloff AD, Zhang C, Siddavatam P, Heaton NS, Wang L, Sengupta R, Sahasrabudhe S, Randall G, Gribskov M, Kuhn RJ, Perera R, LaCount DJ | title = A physical interaction network of dengue virus and human proteins | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = M111.012187 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21911577 | pmc = 3237087 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M111.012187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Candida albicans''===

[[Candida albicans|''C. albicans'']] is a yeast with a particular feature: it translates the CUG codon into serine rather than leucine. Due to this different codon usage it is difficult to use the model system ''S. cerevisiae'' as a Y2H to check for protein-protein interactions using ''C. albicans'' genes. To provide a more native environment a ''C. albicans'' two-hybrid (C2H) system was developed. With this system protein-protein interactions can be studied in ''C. albicans'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Van Dijck P, Tournu H | title = A CUG codon adapted two-hybrid system for the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 38 | issue = 19 | pages = e184 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20719741 | pmc = 2965261 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent addition was the creation of a high-throughput system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoeters |first1=Floris |last2=Munro |first2=Carol A. |last3=d’Enfert |first3=Christophe |last4=Van Dijck |first4=Patrick |last5=Mitchell |first5=Aaron P. |title=A High-Throughput                            Two-Hybrid System |journal=mSphere |date=22 August 2018 |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.1128/mSphere.00391-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legrand |first1=Mélanie |last2=Bachellier-Bassi |first2=Sophie |last3=Lee |first3=Keunsook K |last4=Chaudhari |first4=Yogesh |last5=Tournu |first5=Hélène |last6=Arbogast |first6=Laurence |last7=Boyer |first7=Hélène |last8=Chauvel |first8=Murielle |last9=Cabral |first9=Vitor |last10=Maufrais |first10=Corinne |last11=Nesseir |first11=Audrey |last12=Maslanka |first12=Irena |last13=Permal |first13=Emmanuelle |last14=Rossignol |first14=Tristan |last15=Walker |first15=Louise A |last16=Zeidler |first16=Ute |last17=Znaidi |first17=Sadri |last18=Schoeters |first18=Floris |last19=Majgier |first19=Charlotte |last20=Julien |first20=Renaud A |last21=Ma |first21=Laurence |last22=Tichit |first22=Magali |last23=Bouchier |first23=Christiane |last24=Van Dijck |first24=Patrick |last25=Munro |first25=Carol A |last26=d’Enfert |first26=Christophe |title=Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=10 August 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky747}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''E. coli''===

Bacterial ''E. coli''-based two hybrid methods  (abbreviated as B2H) have several characteristics that may make them preferable to yeast-based homologues. The higher transformation efficiency and faster rate of growth lends ''E. coli'' to the use of larger libraries (in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A low false positive rate of approximately 3x10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;, the absence of requirement for a [[nuclear localisation signal]] to be included in the protein sequence and the ability to study proteins that would be toxic to yeast may also be major factors to consider when choosing an experimental background organism.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

It may be of note that the methylation activity of certain ''E. coli'' [[DNA methyltransferase]] proteins may interfere with some DNA-binding protein selections. If this is anticipated, the use of an ''E. coli'' strain that is defective for a particular methyltransferase may be an obvious solution.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Important to mention is that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and when studying eukaryotic protein-protein interactions (e.g. human proteins) the results need to be carefully approached.

===Mammalian cells===

In recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/promega-notes/66/the-checkmatetm-mammalian-two-hybrid-system.pdf?la=en&lt;/ref&gt; Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;{{cite book

Using a mammalian cell line to study mammalian protein-protein interactions gives the advantage of working in a more native context.&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system.&lt;ref name="Buckholz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckholz RG, Gleeson MA | title = Yeast systems for the commercial production of heterologous proteins | journal = Bio/Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1067–72 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1367623 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1191-1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible with the mammalian two-hybrid system to study signal inputs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v5/n7/full/nsb0798_535.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arabidopsis thaliana''===

In 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of ''A. thaliana''  protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible.
The system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system.&lt;ref name="Ehlert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehlert A, Weltmeier F, Wang X, Mayer CS, Smeekens S, Vicente-Carbajosa J, Dröge-Laser W | title = Two-hybrid protein-protein interaction analysis in Arabidopsis protoplasts: establishment of a heterodimerization map of group C and group S bZIP transcription factors | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 890–900 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16709202 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x/epdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aplysia californica''===

The sea hare [[California sea hare|''A californica'']] is a model organism in neurobiology to study among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two-hybrid system has been developed in ''A californica'' neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi JH, Lee JA, Yim SW, Lim CS, Lee CH, Lee YD, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = Using an aplysia two-hybrid system to examine the interactions between transcription factors involved in long-term facilitation in the nervous system of aplysia | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12551962 | pmc = 196654 | doi = 10.1101/lm.55303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JA, Lee SH, Lee C, Chang DJ, Lee Y, Kim H, Cheang YH, Ko HG, Lee YS, Jun H, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = PKA-activated ApAF-ApC/EBP heterodimer is a key downstream effector of ApCREB and is necessary and sufficient for the consolidation of long-term facilitation | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–38 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16966424 | pmc = 2064337 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200512066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bombyx mori''===

An insect two-hybrid (I2H) system was developed in  a silkworm cell line from the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' (BmN4 cells). This system uses the GAL4 BD and the activation domain of mouse NF-κB P65. Both are under the control of the OpIE2 promoter.&lt;ref name="Mon"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mon H, Sugahara R, Hong SM, Lee JM, Kamachi Y, Kawaguchi Y, Kusakabe T | title = Analysis of protein interactions with two-hybrid system in cultured insect cells | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 392 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–2 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19481053 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2009.05.033 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269709003674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Determination of sequences crucial for interaction===

By changing specific amino acids by mutating the corresponding DNA base-pairs in the plasmids used, the importance of those amino acid residues in maintaining the interaction can be determined.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

After using bacterial cell-based method to select DNA-binding proteins, it is necessary to check the specificity of these domains as there is a limit to the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===Drug and poison discovery===

Protein–protein signalling interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due to their specificity and pervasiveness. The random drug discovery approach uses compound banks that comprise random chemical structures, and requires a high-throughput method to test these structures in their intended target.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

The cell chosen for the investigation can be specifically engineered to mirror the molecular aspect that the investigator intends to study and then used to identify new human or animal therapeutics or anti-pest agents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

===Determination of protein function===

By determination of the interaction partners of unknown proteins, the possible functions of these new proteins may be inferred.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; This can be done using a single known protein against a library of unknown proteins or conversely, by selecting from a library of known proteins using a single protein of unknown function.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

===Zinc finger protein selection===

To select [[zinc finger proteins]] (ZFPs) for [[protein engineering]], methods adapted from the two-hybrid screening technique have been used with success.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; A ZFP is itself a DNA-binding protein used in the construction of custom DNA-binding domains that bind to a desired DNA sequence.&lt;ref name="gommans"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gommans WM, Haisma HJ, Rots MG | title = Engineering zinc finger protein transcription factors: the therapeutic relevance of switching endogenous gene expression on or off at command | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 354 | issue = 3 | pages = 507–19 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16253273 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.06.082 | url = http://www.rug.nl/farmacie/onderzoek/basiseenheden/therapeuticgenemodulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/!find?path=/farmacie/onderzoek/basisEenheden/THErapeuticGeneModulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/2005_6.pdf&amp;params=as=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a selection gene with the desired target sequence included in the UAS, and randomising the relevant amino acid sequences to produce a ZFP library, cells that host a DNA-ZFP interaction with the required characteristics can be selected. Each ZFP typically recognises only 3–4 base pairs, so to prevent recognition of sites outside the UAS, the randomised ZFP is engineered into a 'scaffold' consisting of another two ZFPs of constant sequence. The UAS is thus designed to include the target sequence of the constant scaffold in addition to the sequence for which a ZFP is selected.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

A number of other DNA-binding domains may also be investigated using this system.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Strengths==

*Two-hybrid screens are low-tech; they can be carried out in any lab without sophisticated equipment.
*Two-hybrid screens can provide an important first hint for the identification of interaction partners.
*The assay is scalable, which makes it possible to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the matrix approach.
*Yeast two-hybrid data can be of similar quality to data generated by the alternative approach of [[coaffinity purification]] followed by [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS).&lt;ref name="yu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Braun P, Yildirim MA, Lemmens I, Venkatesan K, Sahalie J, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Gebreab F, Li N, Simonis N, Hao T, Rual JF, Dricot A, Vazquez A, Murray RR, Simon C, Tardivo L, Tam S, Svrzikapa N, Fan C, de Smet AS, Motyl A, Hudson ME, Park J, Xin X, Cusick ME, Moore T, Boone C, Snyder M, Roth FP, Barabási AL, Tavernier J, Hill DE, Vidal M | title = High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5898 | pages = 104–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719252 | pmc = 2746753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1158684 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322..104Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

==Weaknesses==
*The main criticism applied to the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein–protein interactions are the possibility of a high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often found very small overlap in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"&gt;{{cite book

|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F0-387-24532-4_2
|doi=10.1007/0-387-24532-4_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deane"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deane CM, Salwiński Ł, Xenarios I, Eisenberg D | title = Protein interactions: two methods for assessment of the reliability of high throughput observations | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–56 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12118076 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M100037-MCP200 | url = http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/1/5/349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for this high error rate lies in the characteristics of the screen:
*Certain assay variants overexpress the fusion proteins which may cause unnatural protein concentrations that lead to unspecific (false) positives.
*The hybrid proteins are fusion proteins; that is, the fused parts may inhibit certain interactions, especially if an interaction takes place at the N-terminus of a test protein (where the DNA-binding or activation domain is typically attached).
*An interaction may not happen in yeast, the typical host organism for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a [[mammalian]] protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing [[phosphorylation]]), which can also lead to false results.
*The Y2H takes place in the nucleus. If test proteins are not localized to the nucleus (because they have other localization signals) two interacting proteins may be found to be non-interacting.
*Some proteins might specifically interact when they are co-expressed in the yeast, although in reality they are never present in the same cell at the same time. However, in most cases it cannot be ruled out that such proteins are indeed expressed in certain cells or under certain circumstances.

Each of these points alone can give rise to false results. Due to the combined effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example [[co-immunoprecipitation]] of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants&lt;ref name="Chen2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YC, Rajagopala SV, Stellberger T, Uetz P | title = Exhaustive benchmarking of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 667–8; author reply 668 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805792 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nmeth0910-667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bioinformatics techniques.

'''Wastewater''' (or '''waste water''') is any [[water]] that has been affected by human use. Wastewater is "used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, [[surface runoff]] or [[stormwater]], and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies – (2nd Revised Edition)|last = Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 175|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408021403/http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|archivedate = 8 April 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, wastewater is a byproduct of domestic, industrial, commercial or [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include: domestic wastewater from households, municipal wastewater from communities (also called [[sewage]]) or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] from industrial activities. Wastewater can contain physical, chemical and biological [[pollutant]]s.

Households may produce wastewater from [[flush toilet]]s, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines, bath tubs, and showers. Households that use [[dry toilet]]s produce less wastewater than those that use flush toilets.

Wastewater may be conveyed in a [[sanitary sewer]] which conveys only sewage. Alternatively, it can be transported in a [[combined sewer]] which includes [[Surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] and industrial wastewater. After treatment at a [[wastewater treatment plant]], the treated wastewater (also called effluent) is discharged to a receiving water body. The terms "wastewater reuse" or "[[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]]" apply if the treated waste is used for another purpose. Wastewater that is discharged to the environment without suitable treatment causes [[water pollution]].

In developing countries and in rural areas with low population densities, wastewater is often treated by various [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems and not conveyed in sewers. These systems include [[septic tank]]s connected to [[septic drain field|drain fields]], [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sewage systems]] (OSS), [[vermifilter]] systems and many more.

==Terminology==
The overarching term [[sanitation]] includes the management of wastewater, [[human excreta]], [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]] and [[stormwater]]. 
The term [[sewerage]] refers to the physical infrastructure required to transport and treat wastewater.

== Sources ==
Sources of wastewater include the following domestic or household activities:
* [[Human waste|Human excreta]] ([[Human feces|feces]] and [[urine]]) often mixed with used [[toilet paper]] or wipes; this is known as [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] if it is collected with [[flush toilet]]s
* Washing water (personal, clothes, floors, dishes, cars, etc.), also known as [[greywater]] or [[sullage]]
* Surplus manufactured liquids from domestic sources (drinks, cooking oil, [[pesticide]]s, [[lubricant|lubricating oil]], [[paint]], cleaning liquids, etc.)

Activities producing [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Sources of industrial wastewater|industrial wastewater]]:
*[[Industrial stormwater|Industrial site drainage]] (silt, sand, alkali, oil, chemical residues);
*Industrial cooling waters ([[biocide]]s, heat, slimes, silt)
*Industrial processing waters
*Organic or [[biodegradable]] waste, including waste from [[hospital]]s, [[abattoir]]s, [[creamery|creameries]], and [[food]] factories.
*Organic or non bio-degradable waste that is difficult-to-treat from [[pharmaceutical]] or [[pesticide]] manufacturing
*Extreme [[pH]] waste from [[acid]] and [[alkali]] manufacturing 
*[[Toxic]] waste from metal [[plating]], [[cyanide]] production, [[pesticide]] manufacturing, etc.
*[[Solids]] and [[emulsion]]s from [[paper]] mills, factories producing lubricants or hydraulic [[oil]]s, foodstuffs, etc.
*Water used in [[hydraulic fracturing]]
*[[Produced water]] from oil &amp; natural gas production

Other activities or events:
* [[Urban runoff]] from [[highway]]s, [[road]]s, carparks, roofs, sidewalks/pavements (contains oils, animal feces, [[litter]], [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[rubber]] residues from tires, soapscum, [[metal]]s from vehicle [[exhaust gas|exhausts]], de-icing agents, herbicides and pesticides from gardens, etc.)
*[[Agricultural pollution]], direct and diffuse

Wastewater can be diluted or mixed with other types of water by the following mechanisms:
* [[Seawater]] ingress (high volumes of [[salt]] and [[microbe]]s)
* Direct ingress of [[river]] water 
* [[Rain]]fall collected on roofs, yards, hard-standings, etc. (generally clean with traces of [[oil]]s and [[fuel]])
* [[Groundwater]] infiltrated into sewage
* Mixing with other types of wastewater or [[fecal sludge]]

== Pollutants ==
The composition of wastewater varies widely. This is a partial list of pollutants that may be contained in wastewater:

=== Chemical or physical pollutants ===
* [[Toxic heavy metal|Heavy metals]], including [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], and [[chromium]]
* [[Organic material|Organic]] particles such as [[feces]], [[hair]]s, [[food]], [[vomiting|vomit]], paper fibers, plant material, [[humus]], etc.;
* [[Soluble]] organic material such as [[urea]], fruit sugars, soluble [[protein]]s, [[medication|drugs]], [[pharmaceuticals]], etc.;
* [[Inorganic]] particles such as [[sand]], grit, metal particles, [[ceramic]]s, etc.;
* Soluble inorganic material such as [[ammonia]], road-salt, sea-salt, [[cyanide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[thiocyanate]]s, [[thiosulfate]]s, etc.;
* Macro-solids such as [[sanitary napkin]]s, [[Diaper|nappies/diapers]], [[condom]]s, [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], children's toys, dead animals or plants, etc.;
* [[Gases]] such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], etc.;
* [[Emulsion]]s such as [[paint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[mayonnaise]], [[hair]] colorants, emulsified oils, etc.;
* [[Toxins]] such as [[pesticide]]s, [[poison]]s, [[herbicide]]s, etc.
* [[Pharmaceuticals]] and hormones and other hazardous substances
* [[Thermal pollution]] from [[power station]]s and industrial manufacturers

=== Biological pollutants ===
If the wastewater contains [[human feces]], as is the case for [[sewage]], then it may also contain [[pathogens]] of one of the four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71253096|title=Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta, and greywater.|last=World Health Organization|first=|date=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|year=|isbn=9241546859|location=|pages=31|oclc=71253096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C. (2016).

Nairobi and Stockholm: United Nations Environment Programme and Stockholm Environment Institute. {{ISBN|978-92-807-3488-1}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Bacteria]] (for example ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''), 
* [[Virus]]es (for example [[hepatitis A]], [[rotavirus]], [[enteroviruses]]), 
* [[Protozoa]] (for example ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'') and 
* Parasites such as [[helminths]] and their eggs (e.g. ''[[Ascaris]]'' (roundworm), ''[[Ancylostoma]]'' (hookworm), ''[[Trichuris]]'' (whipworm));

It can also contain non-pathogenic bacteria and animals such as [[insect]]s, [[arthropod]]s, small [[fish]].

=== Quality indicators ===
{{Main|Wastewater quality indicators}}
Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of [[pollution]] effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants.

Any [[Redox|oxidizable]] material present in an aerobic natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] (bacterial) or chemical processes. The result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased.

== Treatment ==
{{Main|Wastewater treatment}}
At a global level, around 80% of wastewater produced is discharged into the environment untreated, causing widespread [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017. Wastewater: The Untapped Resource|last=WWAP (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme)|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100201-4|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408061139/http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

There are numerous processes that can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can be treated in [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] which include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater is treated in [[sewage treatment plant]]s (which may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment plant]]s). Agricultural wastewater may be treated in [[agricultural wastewater treatment]] processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.

For municipal wastewater the use of [[septic tank]]s and other On-Site Sewage Facilities ([[OSSF]]) is widespread in some rural areas, for example serving up to 20 percent of the homes in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. (2008). [http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf "Septic Systems Fact Sheet."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412140527/http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf |date=12 April 2013 }} EPA publication no. 832-F-08-057.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of aerobic treatment system is the [[activated sludge]] process, based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed of micro-organisms able to absorb and [[adsorb]] the organic matter carried in the wastewater. Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes ([[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|UASB]], [[Expanded granular sludge bed digestion|EGSB]]) are also widely applied in the treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be highly treated and reused as [[reclaimed water]]. [[Constructed wetland]]s are also being used.

== Disposal ==
[[File:Wastewater effluent.JPG|thumb|right|Industrial wastewater effluent with neutralized pH from tailing runoff in Peru.|300px]]
In some urban areas, municipal wastewater is carried separately in [[sanitary sewer]]s and runoff from streets is carried in [[storm drain]]s. Access to either of these systems is typically through a [[manhole]].

During high precipitation periods a combined sewer system may experience a [[combined sewer overflow]] event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose a serious threat to [[public health]] and the surrounding environment.

Sewage may drain directly into major [[drainage basin|watersheds]] with minimal or no treatment but this usually has serious impacts on the quality of an environment and on the health of people. [[Pathogen]]s can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of [[bioaccumulation]] in animal or human tissue.

Wastewater from industrial activities may be pumped underground through an [[injection well]]. Wastewater injection has been linked to [[Induced seismicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Baan|first=Mirko|last2=Calixto|first2=Frank J.|date=2017-07-01|title=Human-induced seismicity and large-scale hydrocarbon production in the USA and Canada|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC006915/abstract|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=2467–2485|doi=10.1002/2017gc006915|issn=1525-2027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Reuse of excreta}}
Treated wastewater can be reused in industry (for example in [[cooling towers]]), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in [[wetland]]s). In rarer cases it is also used to augment [[drinking water]] supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: [[Ozonation]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[Aerobic treatment system|aerobic treatment]] ([[membrane bioreactor]]), [[forward osmosis]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[Advanced oxidation process|advanced oxidation]].

Some water demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where [[Flush toilet|toilets]] can be flushed using [[greywater]] from baths and showers with little or no treatment.

Irrigation with recycled wastewater can also serve to [[Fertilizer|fertilize]] plants if it contains nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In developing countries, [[agriculture]] is using untreated wastewater for irrigation - often in an unsafe manner. There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. The [[World Health Organization]] developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater – Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017235811/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 |date=17 October 2014 }}.

[[File:Waterleaf respond - geograph.org.uk - 1179152.jpg|thumb|English Romanesque waterleaf capital]]

In [[architecture]], a '''waterleaf''' is a distinctive [[sculpture|sculptural]] motif used on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[column]]s and pillars in [[Europe]]an buildings during the late twelfth century. It is a highly simplified plant motif, characteristic of the "late [[Norman architecture|Norman]]" style of [[Romanesque architecture]]. 

A '''waterleaf capital''' is formed of broad, smooth leaf-shapes (typically four in number), unribbed except for a central fold, which curve upward and outward before curling over at the tips where they meet the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] (the flat slab at the top of the column, normally square but sometimes [[octagon]]al). The curled tip of the waterleaf may be small and neat or large and bulbous; it usually curves inward towards the abacus, but may occasionally turn outwards (both forms can sometimes be seen in adjacent capitals of the same period, as for example at [[Geddington]], Northamptonshire, UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/search/location/geddington*/site/ed-nh-geddi.html ''The Corpus of'' ROMANESQUE SCULPTURE ''in Britain and Ireland'' (CRSBI) website:] Geddington&lt;/ref&gt;).
