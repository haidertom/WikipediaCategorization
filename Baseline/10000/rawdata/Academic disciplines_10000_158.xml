'''Agnostic atheism''' is a philosophical position that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a [[belief]] in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a [[deity]] is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The agnostic atheist may be contrasted with the [[agnostic theist]], who believes that one or more deities exist but claims that the existence or nonexistence of such is unknown or cannot be known.&lt;ref&gt;

I usually reply with a question like, “Well, are you a Republican or an American?” The two words serve different concepts and are not mutually exclusive. Agnosticism addresses knowledge; atheism addresses belief. The agnostic says, “I don't have a knowledge that God exists.” The atheist says, “I don't have a belief that God exists.” You can say both things at the same time. Some agnostics are atheistic and some are theistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Irreligion map.png|thumb|250px|Fraction of atheists and agnostics in different countries]]

One of the earliest definitions of agnostic atheism is that of theologian and philosopher [[Robert Flint]], in his Croall Lecture of 1887–1888 (published in 1903 under the title ''Agnosticism'').

&lt;blockquote&gt;The atheist may however be, and not unfrequently is, an agnostic. There is an agnostic atheism or atheistic agnosticism, and the combination of atheism with agnosticism which may be so named is not an uncommon one.&lt;ref name=flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Flint|title=Agnosticism: The Croall Lecture for 1887–88|year=1903|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|ol=7193167M|pages=49–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWMtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man has failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist... if he goes farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist – an agnostic-atheist – an atheist because an agnostic... while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other...&lt;ref name=flint/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885 [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], popularly known as "The Great Agnostic", explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Susan |date=2013 |title=The Great Agnostic |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |page =17 | isbn=978-0-300-13725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Agnostic is an Atheist. The Atheist is an Agnostic. The Agnostic says, ‘I do not know, but I do not believe there is any God.’ The Atheist says the same.}}

==Epistemological arguments ==
{{Further|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]], or agnostic, atheism argues that people cannot know a God or determine the existence of a God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence.

The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion". The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor [[H. H. Price]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antitheism''' (sometimes '''anti-theism''') is the opposition to [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had a range of applications.  In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | title = Christopher Hitchens – Book Excerpt | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090915172725/http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/01/01-12hitchens-excerpt.html | archivedate = 2009-09-15 | deadurl = yes}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the idea of God==

Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953) for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that god is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. Theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]] (which means "belief in a deity that is not benevolent") or [[misotheism]] (strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God"). Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}
Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.&lt;/ref&gt; New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n458676824862657/ Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "antitheism" (or the hyphenated "anti-theism") has been recorded in English since 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

[[File:Minor Mosque Tashkent.jpg|thumb|''Madrasah in Tashkent'']]
The '''architecture of Uzbekistan''' is considered as the symbol of the nations' history. In spite of changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts, the originality of [[Uzbek architecture]] can be seen in the country. 
[[Samarkand]], [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], [[Shakhrisabz]], [[Termez]] and [[Kokand]] are the most famous architectural centers of art and science. Particularly, palaces, mausoleums and mosques, minarets and ancient masterpieces are survived to capture the pages of history.
By confirming analytical facts from archeological researches about inhabiting the territory of [[Central Asia]], it is stated that trends in architecture are seen parallel to [[Acheulean era]]. In fact, several pieces of monuments belong to both stone and bronze ages have been found in the mountains of [[Surxondaryo Region|Surkhandarya]], [[Tashkent]], [[Samarkand]], [[Fergana]] and [[Navoi]] regions and in rivers’ valleys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, Uzbekistan was the center of the 7000-mile-long Silk Road, which enabled the flourish of architectural designs of Uzbek culture. Besides, Timurid-period architecture from 14th to 16th century, Shaybanid era of the 16th century resulted in the contribution of Islamic architecture and as well as Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/uzbekistan/culture/art_and_architecture.htm Middle ages] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
Till the 20th century, Uzbek architecture has been characterized by its connection with traditional background on the one hand, and modern innovation on the other.

== History ==
Splendid, colorful mosaics, religious symbols, and abstract geometrical patterns have always characterized historical construction in Uzbekistan. At first sight, the design seems beautiful itself while deeper look maintains geometrical and scientific intellect of abstractness.

== Pre-historic times==
The earliest traces of human habitation in the area of [[Uzbekistan]] are dated back many centuries. Turning details, information about ancient settlements proves that the earliest art of construction is [[Sapallitepa]] (17th-14th centuries BC) and [[Jarkutan]] (14th-9th centuries BC), as well as [[Buddhist monuments]], particularly [[Fayaztepa]] and [[Karatepa]], can be found in [[Surhandarya]] region (1st-3rd centuries AD). They all capture the stages of [[Central Asian]] civilization. One of the most important factor about Uzbek national history is the significance of the culture of ancient Khorezm. According to the life of [[Abu Rayhan Beruny]], it can be notified that the city established even 982 years before [[Alexander the Great]] invaded [[Central Asia]], or, in other words, 34 centuries ago. In other words, settlements of ancient [[Khorezm]] antiquityis defined by architectural masterpieces, such as [[Janbaskala]] (4th century BCE), [[Koi Krilgankala]] (2nd century BC – 4th century AD), [[Toprakkala]] (1st century BC – 6th century AD), Ayazkala (2nd century BC, on the territory of Republic of Karakalpakstan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval eras ==
[[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Khiva]] play a vital role in the influence of [[Middle Age]] architecture of [[Uzbekistan]]. For instance, palaces of the rulers, places of residence of aristocracy, market places, madrasah and mausoleums are confirmed as exceptional architectural patterns.

=== The Kyrk-Kyz ===
[[The Kyrk-Kyz]] ('Forty Girls') mansion in Termez dating back the 9th- 10th centuries is a fine example of an original country manor. [[The Samanids Mausoleum]] in [[Bukhara]] still stands as a fine architectural building from the marvelous period of early [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registan ===
[[File:Registan square Samarkand.jpg|thumb|''[[Registan]]'']]
In the 11th-12th centuries, Samarkand became one of the major cities in the region.  As ''The nobles public square in the world''  (Lord Curzon) – [[Registan]] is the main artwork and the heart of the ancient city Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lxmagazines.com/2008/12/the-art-architecture-of-uzbekistan/ Sher-Dar Madrasah] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Being framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture: the [[Ulugh Beg Madrasah]] (1417–1420), the [[Tilla-Kari Madrasah]] (1646–1660) and the [[Sher-Dar Madrasah]] (1619–1636), it was a public square.

The Ulugh Beg Madrasah, was built in the times of Timurid Empire era of Timur, known as [[Tamerlane]]. By looking architectural point of view, it has a lancet-arch (pishtaq) or main square entrance. High minarets represent the beauty of the corners. There is a mosaic panel over the entrance arch, which was decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The building consists of mosque and lecture rooms, specialized for students. The walls have magnificent art galleries along the axes.

The construction of the Sher-Dar and Tilla-Kari madrasahs was ordered to be built in the 17th century. The tiger mosaics appear on the face of each madrasah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamic-arts.org/2014/the-registan-square/ About Registan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion(or tiger) on the Sher-dor madrassa.JPG|thumb|left|The image of a lion on the ''[[Sher-dar Madrasah]]'']]
Specifically, the uniqueness of Sher Dar madrasah is found as images of lion-tigers, deer, and human faces. They are not only just paintings, but also special symbols of power by the perceptions of Islam religion. The real design beauty and association between grand portal, decorated pillars, and other masterpieces are impossible to be captured in photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lxmagazines.com/2008/12/the-art-architecture-of-uzbekistan/ Sher-Dar Madrasah] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tilla-Kari madrasah]] ( means «gold-covered») was known as the last, while huge and the most glorious structure of the Registan Square. Tilla-Kari madrasah includes 120 meter-long façade, relieving the square’s oppressive symmetrical axis. The composition of minaret at the corner gives strength to the architecture of the madrasah. Exterior scene was enriched by polychromatic tiles with geometric patterns. Moreover, at the center, there is tall pishtaq enables each façade to be more glorious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamic-arts.org/2014/the-registan-square/ About Registan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Temur's period captures the 13th century. In particular, strong castles, the symbols of strong government, authority and victory of the Islamic civilization, marketplaces - symbols of the role of trade, and living quarters - the essence of the complex urban life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bibi Khanum Mosque ===
[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|Bibi Khanym Mosque]]
For example, the greatest monumental architecture was the [[Bibi Khanum Mosque]], which has 115 feet high portals, 165-foot minarets, 400 cupolas and a huge courtyard. Specific features about the mosque is the gates, made of seven metals, and the building itself marble and terracotta with a decoration of mosaics and blue-gold frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] web page] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of the Timurid dynasty (14th -16th centuries), as well as the Shaybanid era (16th century) is famous for its colorful architectural designs, such as Turquoise-colored domes: the dome of the Gur-e Amir (Tamerlane's mausoleum in Samarqand).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/uzbekistan/culture/art_and_architecture.htm Middle ages] web page] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century ==
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th centuries constructions give e scene of typical residential architecture of an ordinary Uzbek citizens. While the buildings reflect the experiences of historical background and as well as local and modern conditions of the region. For instance, an inhabited house in Bukhara has a closed character and is isolated from the street noise and dust. Its isolated rooms were built according to the weather changes and create a unique microclimate in both the heat and cold. Further example is Khiva, with a high terrace opened to the wind promotes the creation of a favorable microclimate in houses. So, in [[Ferghana]], for example, houses had sliding walls and shutters, and were decorated with niches, ganch (wooden architecture), and other characteristic conditions. Besides, having very simple design styles, the national are veryrational and supplies the originality of Uzbek culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
It has been proved by the facts that special features of Uzbek architecture harmonize traditional originality of structure formation and consideration of microclimate. The magnificent cities of [[Tashkent]], Samarkand, Bukhara, [[Khiva]] are famous with such fantastic architectural ensembles as Khazrat Imam, Registan, Lyabi Khaus, Ichan Kala etc. Almost all historical cities of Central Asia are considered to be on the «Must seen places».&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pollution abatement]], the '''best available technology''' (or '''BAT''') is the technology approved for limiting pollutant discharges with regard to an abatement strategy. Similar terms are ''best available techniques'', ''best practicable means'' or ''best practicable environmental option''. BAT is a moving target on practices, since developing societal values and advancing techniques may change what is currently regarded as "reasonably achievable", "best practicable" and "best available".

A literal understanding will connect it with a "spare no expense" [[doctrine]] which prescribes the acquisition of the best state of the art [[technology]] available, without regard for traditional [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uci.edu/lawreview/vol4/no4/Sinden.pdf |title=Cost-Benefit Analysis, Ben Franklin, and the Supreme Court  |last1=Sinden |first1=Amy |date=2014 |website=UC Irvine Law Review |publisher=University of California, Irvine School of Law |access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical use, the cost aspect is also taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorrell |first=Steve |title=The Meaning of BATNEEC: Interpreting Excessive Costs in UK Industrial Pollution Regulation |publisher=sussex.ac.uk |date=2001-02-19 |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp61/sewp61.html |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See also discussions on the topic of the [[precautionary principle]] which, along with considerations of ''best available technologies'' and ''cost-benefit analyses'', is also involved in discussions leading to formulation of environmental policies and regulations (or opposition to same).]

''Best practicable means'' was used for the first time in UK national primary legislation in section 5 of the Salmon Fishery Act 1861&lt;ref name="BestPracticableMeans" /&gt; and another early use was found in the [[Alkali Act]] Amendment Act 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Bob |title=BPM/BPEO vs BAT - A personal view |publisher=bnes.com |date=n.d. |url=http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202060742/http://www.bnes.com/Events/Past/2003-10-14-BPEO/Bob%20Smith.pdf |archive-date=2004-02-02 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but before that appeared in the Leeds Act of 1848.

The ''BAT'' concept was first time used in the 1992 [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic for all types of industrial installations (for instance, [[chemical plant|chemical plants]]).

Some doctrine deem it already acquired the status of [[customary law]].

In the [[United States]], BAT or similar terminology is used in the [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]].

''Best available techniques not entailing excessive costs (BATNEEC)'', sometimes referred to as ''best available technology'', was introduced in 1984 with Directive 84/360/EEC and applied to air pollution emissions from large industrial installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31984L0360&amp;from=EN Council Directive 84/360/EEC] (PDF; 496&amp;nbsp;kB) of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Directive 84/360/EEC was superseded by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|Integrated pollution prevention and control directive]] (IPPC), 96/61/EC, which applied the framework concept of ''Best Available Techniques'' (BAT) to the integrated control of pollution to the three media air, water and soil. The concept is also part of the directive's recast in 2008 (2008/1/EC) and its successor directive, the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] 2010/75/EU published in 2010.

According to article 15(2) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures in permits shall be based on the best available techniques, without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0075&amp;from=EN Directive 2010/75/EU] (PDF; 2.78&amp;nbsp;MB) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control).&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive includes a definition of best available techniques in article 3(10):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"best available techniques" means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a whole:
:    - "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;
:    - "available" means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;
:    - "best" means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BAT for a given industrial sector are described in BAT reference documents (BREFs) as defined in article 3(11) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]]. BREFs are the result of an exchange of information between [[European Union]] Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the [[European Commission]] pursuant to article 13 of the directive. This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies]] of the European Commissions' [[Joint Research Centre]], which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012D0119&amp;from=EN Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU] (PDF; 1.54&amp;nbsp;MB) of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning guidance on the collection of data and on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important chapter of the BREFs, the BAT conclusions, are published as implementing decisions of the [[European Commission]] in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]]. According to article 14(3) of the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]], the BAT conclusions shall be the reference for setting permit conditions of large industrial installations.

==United States environmental law==
===Clean Air Act===
The [[Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990|Clean Air Act]] requires that certain facilities employ [[Best Available Control Technology]] to control [[air pollution|emissions]].
: ...an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning, clean fuels, or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of each such pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act of 1990, section 169(3), {{USC|42|7479(3)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean Water Act===
The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires issuance of national [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] discharge regulations (called "[[effluent guidelines]]"), which are based on BAT and several related standards.
: ...effluent limitations for categories and classes of point sources,... which (i) shall require application of the best available technology economically achievable for such category or class, which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 301(b), {{USC|33|1311(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ...Factors relating to the assessment of best available technology shall take into account the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of the effluent standards, the BAT concept is a "model" technology rather than a specific regulatory requirement. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) identifies a particular model technology for an industry, and then writes a regulatory performance standard based on the model. The performance standard is typically expressed as a numeric effluent limit measured at the discharge point. The industrial facility may use any technology that meets the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related CWA provision for [[water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] intake structures requires standards based on "best technology available."
: ...the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 316(b), {{USC|33|1326(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conventions==

The concept of BAT is also used in a number of international conventions such as the [[Minamata Convention]] on Mercury, the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, or the [[OSPAR Convention]] for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic.

[[File:Amazon rain forest2.JPG|thumb|Amazon rain forest biotope]]

A '''biotope''' is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of [[flora (plants)|plants]] and [[fauna (animals)|animals]]. ''Biotope'' is almost synonymous with the term ''[[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]'', which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries. However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished: the subject of a habitat is a [[population]], the subject of a biotope is a ''[[biocoenosis]]'' or ''biological community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/t/ishikawa/bachlers2003/HoshinoHP/hajimeni.htm Toshiyuki Hoshino. ''Fundamental research in nurtural management of large biotope aiming for regeneration of nature: Introduction''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is an English [[loanword]] derived from the German ''[[:de:Biotop|Biotop]]'', which in turn came from the Greek ''bios'', "life" and ''topos'', "place". (The related word ''[[geotope]]'' has made its way into the English language by the same route, from the German ''[[:de:Geotop|Geotop]]''.) The word ''biotope'', literally translated, means an "area where life lives".

==Ecology==
The concept of a biotope was first advocated by [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919), a German zoologist famous for the [[recapitulation theory]]. In his book ''General Morphology'' (1866), which defines the term "[[ecology]]", he stresses the importance of the concept of habitat as a prerequisite for an organism's existence. Haeckel also explains that with one ecosystem, its [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is shaped by environmental factors (such as water, soil, and geographical features) and interaction among living things; the original idea of a biotope was closely related to evolutional theory. Following this, F. Dahl, a professor at the Berlin Zoological Museum, referred to this ecological system as a "biotope" (biotop) (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Atushi Iwasawa.(2005). ''Preservation of biotope from zoological view point: Introduction: What is biotope?'', from [http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 The January, 2005, issue of ''Biological Science News''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotope restoration==
Although the term "biotope" is considered to be a technical word with respect to ecology, in recent years the term is more generally used in administrative and civic activities. Since the 1970s the term "biotope" has received great attention as a keyword throughout Europe (mainly Germany) for the preservation, regeneration, and creation of natural environmental settings.&lt;ref&gt;''School biotope is a subject matter for environmental and lifelong learning''. Retrieved October 24, 2006, from [http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html Eco Culture Lab Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307144430/http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, the term "biotope" often refers to a smaller and more specific ecology and is very familiar to human life. In Germany especially, activities related to regenerating biotopes are enthusiastically received. These activities include —
* making [[roof garden]]s,
* reconstructing rivers to restore their natural qualities,
* leaving bushes or trees on farms,
* building nature parks along motorways "[[Autobahn]],"
* making school [[garden]]s or [[pond]]s by considering the [[ecosystem]], and
* bearing in mind ecological considerations in private gardens.

Various sectors play a part in these activities, including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, traffic, agriculture, river engineering, [[limnology]], [[biology]], education, [[landscape gardening]], and domestic gardening. In all fields, all sorts of people are seeking a viable way for humans to respect other living things. The term "biotope" would include a complete environmental approach.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Matsuda.(n.d.) ''What is biotope?'' Retrieved December 10, 2006, from [http://www.tiara.cc/~germany/index_biotope.html Pages of environmental information in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The following four points are the chief characteristics of biotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Shin Mizukoshi.(2005). ''Media Biotope: Characteristics of biotope'', p. 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscale===
A biotope is generally not considered to be a large-scale phenomenon. For example, a biotope might be a neighbouring park, a back garden, even potted plants or a fish tank on a porch. In other words, the biotope is not a macroscopic but a microscopic approach to preserving the ecosystem and biological diversity. So biotopes fit into ordinary people's daily activities and lives, with more people being able to take part in biotope creation and continuing management.

===Biotope networks===
It is commonly emphasised that biotopes should not be isolated. Instead biotopes need to be connected to each other and other surrounding life for without these connections to life-forms such as animals and plants, biotopes would not effectively work as a place in which diverse organisms live. So one of the most effective strategies for regenerating biotopes is to plan a ''stretch'' of biotopes, not just a ''point'' where animals and plants come and go. (Such an organic traffic course is called a [[Wildlife corridor|corridor]].) In the stretch method, the centre of the network would be large green tracts of land: a forest, natural park, or cemetery. By connecting parcels of land with smaller biotope areas such as a green belt along the river, small town parks, gardens, or even roadside trees, biotopes can exist in a network. In other words, a biotope is an open not a closed system and is a practicable strategy.

===Human daily life===
The term "biotope" does not apply to [[biosphere reserves]], which are completely separate from humans and become the object of human admiration. Instead, it is an active part of human daily life. For example, an ornamental flower bed may be considered a biotope (though rather a small one) since it enhances the experience of daily life. An area that has many functions, such as human living space, and is home to other living things, whether plant or animal, can be considered a biosphere reserve.

===Artificial===
When artificial items are introduced to a biotope setting, their design and arrangement is of great importance for biotope regeneration. Tree-planting areas where the surface is uneven results in plants that sprout and the nesting of small insects. A mat or net made from natural fibres will gradually biodegrade as it is exposed to the weather. So there is no binomial opposition between the natural and the artificial in a biotope. Rather, such artificial materials are widely used.

==Germany==
It is especially characteristic in Germany, which is the birthplace of the term biotope, that the authorities take the initiative in conserving biotopes, maintaining consistency with urban or rural planning and considering the regions' history and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }} Atsushi.I.(2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal basis===
The federal nature protection law ([[Bundesnaturschutzgesetz or BNUM]], since 1976) requires that wild animals and plants and their community should be protected as part of the ecosystem in the specific diversity that has grown naturally and historically, and their biotope and other living conditions should be protected, preserved, developed, and restored. (Number 9, Clause 1, Article 2). The law also requires that some kinds of biotope that are full of a specific variety should not be harmed by development. So there is a law that mandates the protection of biotopes. There is also a provincial law corresponding to the federal one. Such developments were uncommon in those times.

===Landscape plan===
Many German states are obliged by law to produce a landscape plan ([[Landschaftsplan]]) as part of their urban planning, though these plans vary somewhat from place to place. The purpose of the "Landschaftsplan" is to protect the region's environment and landscape. These plans use text and figures to describe the present environmental state and proposed remedies. They consider, for example, the regional lie of the land, climate, wind direction, soil, ground water, type of biotope, distribution of animals and plants, inhabitants' welfare and competition with development projects.

===Citizen welfare===
Biotope preservation in cities also emphasises recreation and relaxation for citizens and improving the urban environment. For example, in the reserve of [[Karlsruhe]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] people can cycle on the bike path or walk the dog, although it is forbidden to gather plants and animals there or walk in the exclusion zone. At the core of biotope preservation is the idea that if civic life is surrounded by a rich profusion of nature whose background is in local history and culture, it is improved by protecting nature and preserving the landscape.

==Aquaria==
The term "biotope" is also used by [[aquarium]] hobbyists to describe an [[aquascaping|aquarium setup]] that tries to simulate the natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] of specific fish. The idea is to replicate conditions such as water parameters, natural plants, water type ([[Freshwater aquarium|fresh]], [[Marine aquarium|saline]] or [[Brackish-water aquarium|brackish]]), lighting, and to include other native fish which usually live together in nature and as such, represent a particular real-world biotope. An example of one [[South American]] biotope type might be lots of [[bog-wood]], a few native plants, dark substrata and subdued lighting with floating plants, along with [[Marbled hatchetfish|marbled hatchets]], [[Pterophyllum|angels]], [[Cardinal tetra|cardinals]], [[Otocinclus|otos]], [[Corydoras|corys]] and [[Hypostomus plecostomus|plecostomus]].

'''Buddhist influences on print technology''' in [[East Asia]] are far-reaching.  The history of writing in Asia dates back to the 13th century BC.  China used bones and shells for religious inscriptions in the form of divinations.&lt;ref name="Tsien" &gt;{{cite book
  |author=[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]
  |title=Written on Bamboo &amp; Silk: The Beginnings of Chinese Books &amp; Inscriptions
  |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |location=Chicago
  |year=2004
  |pages=201
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these beginnings, numerous forms of writing and printing were developed.  In many instances, as in [[Europe]], it was religion that played a major role in the development of writing and printing techniques or which was the reason behind the usage of these techniques. Of the religions in East Asia, it was [[Buddhism]] that played the strongest role in influencing writing and, in particular, printing. There were other factors that influenced the creation of manuscript and print culture, but Buddhism had the largest influence in spreading the usage of print technology, which in turn led to an increase in the dissemination of secular printing and literacy as well as wielding an important influence on economics, government, and competing religions/philosophies.

== Brief survey of writing &amp; printing in early China ==
The earliest known writing in [[China]] are inscriptions on bones and shells which were used for divination for approximately three centuries until the late 11th century BC. Inscriptions can also be found on bronze, [[jade]], stone, and pottery. [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze]] was developed as a permanent record of socio-political and ceremonial information in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Stone, on the other hand, is the only permanent method used continuously from ancient times to present. Also, stone was used extensively for inscriptions on monuments and for the preservation of [[Confucian]], Buddhist, and [[Taoist]] texts. Clay inscriptions flourished from the 4th or 5th century BC until the early 4th century AD.  These inscriptions were primarily records of names, titles, and phrases such as good luck sayings.&lt;ref name="Tsien" /&gt;(201)

[[History of silk|Silk]] was also used for the recording of information starting in the 7th or 6th century BC.  The predecessors to paper-based books in China were strips and tablets made of [[bamboo]] or wood, which were bound by cords and used much like books are today. This method of transmission of information was in use at the same time as the usage of bronze and the other methods.  Bamboo and wood was used for approximately three centuries more than paper and silk was in use for some 500 years longer than paper.  These methods were favoured by tradition and also had some advantages over paper. 
 
A less expensive alternative was developed, a form of paper made from a refuse fiber called [[zhi]]. This paper was developed before the Christian era and became commonplace in the 1st or 2nd century AD for books and other documents, but the other methods of recording information  continued.  Paper books were originally in the form of rolls, then folded leaves, and finally bound volumes like the books in use today.

There were various methods for the production of early Chinese records. Bone and stone media were engraved or incised with a metal stylus or knife.  Wood, bamboo, silk, and paper was written on with brush-pens; the ink was black; usage of ink dates to [[Neolithic China]].  [[stylus|Styli]] were also used and were made of bamboo, wood, horn, and metal, but it is not known when the stylus first came into common usage. Book knives were used as erasers for bamboo and wood tablets but not for inscriptions.  Inscriptions on bronze were [[casting|cast]] from molds. Inscriptions on clay were made by molds or were impressed with stamps. [[Seal (duplicate)|Seals]] were used to produce duplicates on soft clays and later on silk and paper. These seals were cast from metals or cut from [[jade]] or stone. Before the invention of woodblock printing, inked impressions from stone or other inscriptions would be made by rubbing or squeezing paper over their surfaces.  This technique was used up to the early 6th century and led to the invention of printing. Moveable type was invented in China some 400 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s press.  (1, 202-203)

== Buddhism and printing in China ==
The period following the collapse of the [[Han empire|Han]] (220 AD) is known as (one of the many) “Dark Ages” and was typified by political strife, wars, and social upheaval.  Despite the turmoil of that period, learning and culture continued to grow. Among the intellectual elite and rulership, Confucianism continued to be the dominant philosophy. Taoism and Buddhism emerged as religions and began to flourish.

Buddhism, a populist religion, had been introduced to China at the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and quickly became a religion sought after in times of strife by the masses where it was propagated. The first translation of a Buddhist text appeared in China in the 2nd century AD and by the 3rd century the volume of translations had increased a great deal.  Buddhism’s influence on literature and scholarship grew in relation to the conversion of the elite and ruler ship.  (17)

During the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 AD), Buddhism enjoyed an explosion in the production of printed texts.  This is partly due to the reunification of the empire and partly because [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that all Buddhist texts then in print were to be copied and placed in temple libraries in all the major cities.  Another factor that influenced this increase in printing was the creation of a bureau in 606 AD for the translation of Buddhist texts &lt;!--from what language to what language? --&gt; at the behest of [[Emperor Yang]].  To illustrate this diffusion of Buddhist texts, the History of the Sui Dynasty’s bibliography lists 1950 Buddhist titles as compared to 377 Taoist titles.

Buddhism was, therefore, probably the most important factor in the development of printing. The demand for Buddhist texts was so great that it encouraged accelerated levels of printing for the following century. Despite the increased demand for Buddhist literature, the production of books by hand did not end.  Printing only increased the number of copies of books, thus facilitating the ease and degree of communication.  (18, 205)

As Confucianism was the major competing native belief set among the elite, the reason that Buddhist texts enjoyed such widespread printing needs explanation.&lt;ref name="Mair" &gt;{{cite journal

Mair suggests that perhaps there is something inherent in Buddhism that is conducive to its being written in what he calls “vernacular Sinitic” as opposed to the “literary Sinitic” used for native Chinese texts.  One aspect of Buddhism that Mair cites is the notion of [[upaya]], known as fang-pien in Chinese; followers of the Buddha should do whatever is in their power to do to insure the salvation of all living things.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713) This would certainly help explain why Buddhist texts would be printed and circulated in a written language that is more accessible to a wider audience. Another point Mair makes is that lecture notes for sermons by laymen and monks were written in the vernacular language.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This makes sense considering that these notes were to be spoken from; one would not make notes for a sermon in a stilted and highly literary language.  Other Buddhist texts such as [[parable]]s were popular with the masses and so when written, the vernacular is the clear choice.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

Another inherent trait that Mair cites is the ostensibly oral nature of Buddhism and how the religion stresses that “…Buddha is beyond the ‘paths of speech’” and “…’the way of language is cut off, the workings of the mind are obliterated’….” (Ibid.)  Mair also writes:
: “Even the Zen masters, whose words are ironically preserved in written vernacular (perhaps one should say, especially the Zen masters),…’nonestablishment of written words’ (pu li wen-tzu), which disparages the efficacy of language, especially in its written form, to convey essential truths.”  &lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713-714)

Despite this, even Buddhism could not survive and function as a religion without sacred texts.  Many Buddhist texts begin with the phrase evam me sutam (ju shih wo wen, “thus I have heard”).  Buddhist texts also make use of other expressions such as fo shuo (“spoken by the Buddha”). Mair points out that this underlines the direct oral transmission of Buddha’s teachings to the community through Ananda.  So, these phrases are a stamp of authenticity for the text, even when a text did not originate in India.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714)  Given this oral nature of Buddhism, it makes sense that its texts would be rendered in vernacular rather than literary Chinese.

The strongest explanation for the use of vernacular, and by extension the rapid spread of Buddhism and its influence on print culture, is the process by which Buddhism was introduced to China.  Mair argues that the process of translation was what influenced the use of vernacular in Chinese Buddhist texts. Commerce also played a strong role, but this will be discussed later.  It was foreigners that began the process of translation into Chinese (“…the early impetus for the translation of Buddhist texts into [[Sinitic]] came primarily from foreign monks resident in China.”)&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714-715, 717)  What Mair calls “literary Sinitic” is an extremely difficult language to learn, “…requiring at least ten to fifteen years to gain a modicum of proficiency.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(716)  These foreign translators were adults when they came to China and most likely learned spoken Chinese through immersion in the culture before learning how to write the language.  When it came time to write, they used the language they knew which was the vernacular.  Also, when it was Chinese Buddhists working on writing a text, they worked in teams with other Chinese dictating their translations.  Obviously since literary Chinese is unspeakable, the dictation was done in the vernacular. (Ibid.)

The above argument is the strongest for what might be called the mechanical process for the rapid spread of Buddhism and the vast amount of texts available (and the rise in the use of printing) to a wider audience.  What is also a very important aspect in the spread of Buddhism and its influence on printing is the ideological aspects of Buddhism.  As opposed to the native Chinese religions/philosophies, Buddhism is a populist religion.  As Mair writes:  “…Buddhism functioned (and perhaps originated) as a means for the individual to escape from the normal societal bonds.” (719)  Buddhism appealed to the dispossessed, those that were outside the Confucian institutions.  Because Confucianism stressed a rigid social order, many people found themselves stuck in a social position they could not escape from.

The Buddhist community in China consisted of, for example, a large number of widows, orphans, and others that had no place in the fabric of Confucian society.  Literary Chinese was associated with the elite; those that could afford to attend the bureaucratic schools for example.  Buddhism aggressively pursued the conversion of followers and to move into a new area such as China&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721), it makes sense that Buddhism would make use of the vernacular in its texts; it was more accessible to the masses.  Because of this accessibility there was an increased demand for texts and thus the rise in printing.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(720)

Mair cites Daniel Gardner and his work on [[Neo-Confucianism]].  It seems that the vernacular was employed in Neo-Confucian texts because of its: 
: “…more inquisitive approach it permitted toward the classics…Considering the powerful influence of Buddhism
on the formation of Neo-Confucian thought and practice, the adoption of the written vernacular as a legitimate form of serious intellectual discussion would seem to be one more example of the radical restructuring of Confucianism brought about by this foreign religion.” (Ibid.)

So, not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also it also influenced society at large in adapting to the norms of Buddhist thought.  These influences were manifested in literature, philosophy, government, etc.  As Mair writes, “…may be analyzed sociolinguistically as emanating from the fundamentally demotic impulses of the religion."&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721)

== Buddhism and printing in Korea ==
The story of printing in [[Korea]] is slightly different from in China, but Buddhism did play an important role in the development of printing.  Just as in China and Japan, [[woodblock printing]] was the primary technique used for printing, but a scarcity of resources needed for the production of woodblocks in Korea created a need for the invention of an alternative, which was moveable type. Korea was in the unique position among Asian countries of having an [[Korean alphabet|alphabet]] that facilitated the use of moveable type. This is not to say that woodblocks were not used.  Once [[moveable type]] came into use, Korea was no longer quite as dependent on China for texts.

Sometime in the 4th century the Chinese educational system was introduced to what was then the [[Koguryo state]]. A [[civil service examination system]] was established in [[Silla]] after the Korean states consolidated in the 7th century.  As the power of the government grew, demand for books from China increased.  Korea began to print its own texts and books from woodblocks in the 10th century.  Prior to 1056 Korea was mainly a manuscript culture.  Complaints from a provincial capital spurred the government to order copies from the royal collection to be printed. Newly carved woodblocks were sent from the provinces to the royal library, which spurred the production of more woodblocks.&lt;ref name="Sohn" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;(97)

Other than the perceived (and possibly true) unreliability of manuscript copies, religion provided an additional stimulus for the printing of texts from woodblocks, just as in the other countries of East Asia.  A large scale carving of woodblocks for the purpose of printing the [[Tripitaka]] was undertaken starting sometime around 1014.  During the last twenty odd years of the 11th century, more Tripitaka woodblocks were carved, in addition to woodblocks for other Chinese Buddhist works.  The demand for Buddhist texts, as well as Confucian texts, grew in the following years.  Most of these were subsequently destroyed during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

At the time, Korea was rather zealous in its attempts to acquire Buddhist (and other) texts and utilized whatever means it could to acquire texts.  In addition to trade with [[Song dynasty|Song]] China, Korea bought books from private markets (once again, commerce and Buddhism will be discussed later).  The zealousness Korea had to acquire Buddhist texts also provided an impetus for the printing of texts.  By the end of the 11th century Korea had better copies of common texts as well as rare copies of certain editions.  Previously the flow of books was mainly from China to Korea, but in 1091 China asked Korea for 117 books that no longer existed in China’s libraries, a situation similar to that in Europe a few centuries earlier where Ireland had preserved Christian texts no longer in existence on the continent.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This illustrates the strong role that Buddhism played in printing.  Buddhism provided the stimulus to keep as many texts in print as possible.  When these texts were lost in China, Korea proved to be an important repository of Buddhist literature due to its commitment to the printing of Buddhist texts.

Buddhism also played a role in the development of moveable type. Religion was not the only contributing factor in Korea’s development of moveable type.  First, the Song dynasty (which was apparently the only source outside of Korea for books) fled south after the Chin invasion in 1127. Second, many of Korea’s libraries were destroyed resulting in the loss of many texts and woodblocks during a power struggle in the royal court.  Thirdly, the scarcity of hardwoods used in the production of woodblocks in Korea contributed to the need for a more readily made printing source. Pine was the most common wood available in Korea at the time, but is not a good source for woodblocks.  There was birch, but these trees were not common and were to be found mostly on mountainous terrain making it difficult to get to and expensive to transport. (98)

The Koreans at that time were most likely already aware of moveable type as it had already been invented in China. In China, moveable type was made from baked clay, but the Koreans improved upon this by making cast-type.  Metal casting existed in Korea, but with the introduction of a new method of coin casting from China in 1102, Korea finally had the technology to create an effective method of printing using moveable type.  This method of casting came in the form of carving two molds that were joined together with the liquid metal presumably being poured into the hollow thus created. (98-100)  So with the zealous desire for Buddhist texts, the scarcity of resources for woodblock production, the introduction of new technology, and the cessation of trade with China, Korea was able to continue to print Buddhist texts.

There are other examples of how Buddhism stimulated printing in Korea. Despite the difficulties the [[Mongol]] invasion presented, printing of texts continued.  While in exile on [[Kangwha Island]], the [[Goryeo#Mongol invasions .281231 - 1350.29|Koryo]] government re-carved a woodblock edition of a Buddhist text crucial to the [[Son sect]] that had become scarce. Sohn also suggests that the invention of moveable type was due to the general scarcity of books after 1127 but before the Mongol invasion.  Sohn mentions that there was an urgent need for these texts. (98)  What he does not mention, and I would suggest, is that moveable type was used because it would have taken too long to re-carve the woodblocks.  Thus moveable type was utilized to meet the urgent demand for the texts.

There is more evidence for the influence that Buddhism had on the printing of texts.  In 1446, King Sejong introduced the Hunmin chong um, a text that introduced the new system for writing vernacular Korean.  In the preface to this text, there is a line (“Even the sound of the winds, the cry of the crane, the cackle of fowl and the barking of dogs – all may be written” [Mair, 733]) that is derived from a Sung scholar (Cheng Ch’iao) that “praises the phonological sophistication of the Buddhist monks.”  The fact that Sejong was a devout Buddhist could possibly also be seen as evidence of the Buddhist influence on printing. All but two of the earliest texts using Sejong’s Hunmin chong um were Buddhist texts.  Also, Hunmin chong um is based partly on Phags-pa that can be traced back to Srong-brtsan-sgam-po, the king who introduced Buddhism to [[Tibet]].  “The Buddhist impetus, in turn, carried through to King Sejong’s Hunmin chong um.” (731, 734)   This illustrates that not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also on language reform, which in turn further influenced printing.  With the introduction of Hunmin chong um, printing using moveable type in Korea became much more practical.

There are a number of differences between China and Korea which rendered moveable type easier for Korea than China. First, China did not have a script reform that made the use of moveable type more practical as in Korea.  The large number of characters used in written Chinese posed a great challenge to the use of moveable type. Instead of making type for every character all at once, why not make new type as it was needed?  In this way a gradual shift to moveable type printing could have been accomplished. Second, the historical record shows that in China there was a preference for that which was already established and familiar (e.g. the preference of bamboo/wood books over the usage of paper books). Chinese moveable type was made from baked clay, rendering it breakable.

== Buddhism and printing in Japan ==
Little is known about the techniques and procedures used for woodblock printing before 1600 in [[Japan]]; printing and publishing in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period became more commercialized and thus there is more information about it.&lt;ref name="Kornicki" &gt;Kornicki, Peter. The Book in Japan:  A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century.  Brill, Leiden, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;(47)

First a manuscript is passed to a copyist and a clean copy (''hanshita'') is written out.  Sometimes a [[calligrapher]] would be employed to make a copy when quality calligraphy was desired, although the author often prepared the copy.  Second, the hanshita was given to the block-carver who pasted the hanshita face down onto a wooden block and carved away the white parts leaving the text, illustrations, and borders in relief.  Third, the block was passed to the printer who inked the block, laid a sheet of paper on it, and then rubbed the paper to make the impression.  Sometimes a printing was made for the purpose of proofreading but this seems to have been rather rare.  It is not clear how much proofreading was done but it was done for the more important texts. (52)  Fourth, when enough copies were printed they were passed to someone who aligned the pages.  Lastly, a cover was made and the book was finally bound. (47, 48)

The reproduction of texts was done by the technique called ''[[kabusebori]]''.  Reproduction was an unstable process.  Copies would be made from earlier editions of the text by using the text itself as the hanshita.  The woodblock resulting from this technique of duplication was similar but not an exact replica.  This method was used during the Muromachi period to reproduce Chinese texts and also when a popular text needed to be reprinted but the original woodblocks were worn down, damaged, or lost. (49)  This method was also used when particular pages of a text needed to be replaced such as when some woodblocks were more worn than others or when a family or business needed to update its directories. (52)

Umeki was another technique used to make corrections to a text to avoid censorship or when mistakes were made during the carving process.  A portion of the woodblock would be carved out and removed, then replaced with the corrected text on a portion of wood measuring the same dimensions as that which had been removed. (52)

Print technology was introduced to Japan in the 8th century but it took approximately 1000 years for Japan to become a print culture when printing had finally become commercialized. (112)  Initially printing in Japan was a ritual exercise for the production of devotional texts and it was not until the 11th century that texts were printed for the purpose of reading.  This was much the case in China although calendars and Buddhist texts had been printed for reading for quite some time.  Therefore, printing reached Japan from China in the form of a ritual practice. (113)

The only surviving evidence of printing from the 8th century Japan comes from Nara in the form of the [[Hyakumanto Dharani]]. (115) The Hyakumanto Dharani are slips of paper with Buddhist text printed on them installed in miniature pagoda that were placed at various locations in Nara.  They were apparently made to atone for a rebellion that took place 746.  The rebellion was in response to the growing influence Buddhism had in the Japanese court; a Buddhist monk, Dokyo, had been able to have himself appointed to the position of Chancellor of the Realm.  The interference in courtly matters by the Buddhist clergy led to much resentment and Fujiwara no Nakamaro led a rebellion against Dokyo.  The ex-Empress Shotoku ordered the printing of one million charms to appease the Buddhist monks and temples, although it is unclear whether this order was fully carried out.&lt;ref name="Hickman" &gt;Hickman, Brian.  “A Note on the Hyakumanto Dharani.” Monumenta Nipponica, vol. 30, no. 1, (Spring, 1975), 87-93&lt;/ref&gt;(87-88)  Very few of the dharani survived to this day.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;(89)  Hyakumanto dharani represent the earliest existing proof (from Japan) that Buddhism was an influence on printing in East Asia.

[[Inbutsu]], religious stamps depicting the Buddha, were common in pre-Heian times and continued to be made through the Heian period.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"/&gt;(117)  Further evidence of printing in the Heian period comes in the form of books and other texts imported from China by Japanese monks returning to Japan from China and Chinese monks and travelers.  Devotional printing was common in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan.  Fujiwara no Michinaga’s diary (1009 AD) mentions that 1000 copies of the “[[Lotus Sutra]]” were commissioned but none of these survive. It seems that the paper that these devotional texts were printed on was of poor quality and this explains why so few of them exist to this day.  The reason for printing these devotional texts lay in the meritorious act of reproducing sacred texts, not in the reading of them.  Therefore, there was no concern for the fate of the texts after being printed since the act of printing them was what brought about merit. (118)  As described above, Buddhist influence on printing in Japan was initially for gaining merit with the Buddha and great effort was put into printing texts for this reason.  Because Japan during the Nara and Heian periods was primarily a manuscript culture and texts for reading were hand copied, Buddhism’s influence on print had yet to exhibit the influence it did in China.

Practical printing can be dated to the 11th century, during the Heian era when Chinese texts from the [[Song dynasty]] became popular in Japan in the form of commentaries on [[Sūtra|sutras]] and doctrines. [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] became the center of non-devotional printing in Heian Japan and the oldest existing example of this kind is the [[Joyuishikiron]] (a Buddhist text in Chinese) of 1088 printed by the monks of the [[Kofukuji temple]]. [[Kyoto]] became the center of devotional printing because this is where the aristocratic sponsorship for such printing existed. (118-119)

During the [[Kamakura period]] printing became more established and began to shift its emphasis from devotional printing to practical printing.  Inbutsu continued to be produced but their production began to expand to more populist images such as the Amida Buddha and Jizo.  The Kofukuji was important in the shift to practical printing as well as other temples such as Todaiji, Daianji, and Saidaiji.  The monasteries of [[Mt. Koya]] also began printing texts of the Shingon sect, continuously printing up to the 19th century.  It was during the Kamakura period that Kyoto began to be a center of printing.  The 13th-century temple Sen’yuji was one of the most prominent.  Its founder, Shunjo, had brought back books from China and reproduced them using the kabusebori technique.  Texts from Song editions relating to monastic discipline were also printed. Kyoto temples also began printing Pure Land Sect texts during the Kamakura period but the location and dates of production is unknown. (119-121)

It is from the [[Pure Land Sect]] that the first book printed in Japanese, the Kurodani shonin gotoroku (1321), originates. It is most likely due to the populist nature of the Pure Land Sect that this text was printed in Japanese.  It was a collection of sayings by the sect’s founder Honen (1133–1212).  It was printed in hiragana with kanji glossed with furigana.  Later in the 14th century more of Honen’s works were printed.  The Pure Land Sect was one of the first Buddhist sects responsible for reaching out to a general audience through the print medium in the Kamakura period. (121)

[[Zen]] sects had the largest influence on printing during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.  Texts came from five monasteries in [[Kyoto]] and five in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and later other Zen temples began to print texts.  It was with the Zen-printed texts that an educational element began to enter into the act of printing.  These texts were reproductions of Zen master sayings intended for the training of novices and disseminating the teachings to lay persons.  Devotionals were still printed but when Zen monasteries printed devotional texts it was at the behest of sponsors rather than the monasteries themselves. (121-122)

Gozan-ban (the name given to texts printed by Zen sects) were for the most part written by Chinese authors but some were by Japanese authors (monks).  They were also kabusebori editions so they looked like Chinese editions.  Chinese monks also assisted in the printing of Gozan-ban.  Eight Chinese monks had traveled to Kyoto in the 14th century (1367) and these monks were mostly block-carvers and printers employed by the Japanese monks and temples.  Some texts, though, were printed at the expense of the Chinese monks.  Most of the Gozan-ban were Zen and other Buddhist texts but some were secular texts of Chinese origin.  It was in the 14th century that the first non-Buddhist texts were printed.  By the 16th century a large number of secular Chinese texts had been printed by Zen temples.  It would seem then that the Zen monks were the custodians of Chinese culture in Japan. (122)

From the 14th to 16th century secular texts are divided into three categories:  1) canonical texts, 2) dictionaries and other sinological reference texts, and 3) poetic texts.  The first secular Chinese text to be printed was [[Confucius]]’ [[Analects]], printed in Sakai in 1364 with commentaries by the third century scholar He Yan.  In 1528, some Chinese medical texts were printed.  Not all the secular texts were printed by Zen monks, but one quarter of the Gozan-ban were secular texts and printed in Japan for the first time.  The Zen monks' interest in secular Chinese literature resulted in much of the Chinese poetry and Confucian literature printed. (123)

By the 16th Century printing was well established but had yet to become commercial.  Prior to this, the printing of books for reading was done primarily by Buddhist monasteries and monks and were mostly Buddhist texts in the original Chinese.  These books may have been made available for sale.  Little is known how the books were circulated before the Tokugawa era. (124-125)

Buddhism influenced both printing and reading.  The earliest references to reading in Japan relates to Buddhist texts. (251) There is a question regarding “reading” because at first Buddhist texts were printed as a meritorious act and “reading” was secondary.  Buddhist texts were studied and there was a ritualized reading of them.  When discussing reading of the sutras and other tests, “reading” takes a number of forms:  silent vs. chanted, individual vs. mass/group.  During the Nara and Heian periods, there was a number of public readings of Buddhist texts for devotional and other religious reasons. (252)

Buddhism played a large role in literacy during the Nara and Heian periods.  Because Buddhism was a scriptural religion, literacy in Chinese was required because texts available to the Japanese were printed in Chinese. During the Heian period it was men who were for the most part literate in Chinese (most likely the “literary Sinetic” that Mair refers to) but there is proof that some women were literate in Chinese as well. After the Heian period Buddhism remained a text-based religion and it was the Zen monks were particularly interested in secular Chinese texts. The literacy in Chinese that was thought to be so important during the Nara and Heian periods became less stringent during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Literacy gave way to the Sino-Japanese kanbun. The literate were most likely to be found in the Zen monasteries during these periods. (270-271) Literacy began to rise during the Tokugawa period as a result of printing becoming commercialized and the Tokugawa bureaucracy had become dependent on printed and written communications among the various government offices in the capital and provinces. (272-273)

So from the Nara period on, literacy in Chinese was important for the Japanese bureaucracy, but more important for the reproduction of Buddhist texts and the production of commentaries on Buddhist texts.  In the 7th and 8th Centuries the greatest efforts at manuscript and printed text (by extension) production was for the copying of Buddhist texts.  There is evidence that the entire Buddhist canon existent in Japan had been copied by 673.  By 700 there was a large number of Buddhist temples and monasteries that required texts.  By 727 the government had established a sutra scriptorium (the Shakyojo) in Nara that was the center of sutra-copying.  It did not survive the move to Heian-kyo.   The number of surviving printed Buddhist texts, as opposed to printed secular texts, helps to illustrate the influence Buddhism had on printing. (91)

== Commerce and Buddhism ==
Buddhism and commerce were also tied closely together.  The two stimulated each other in a cyclical fashion such that, among other things, printing was influenced to a large degree.

The official histories of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian societies largely neglected to record a number of commercial enterprises that the elite (bureaucracy) were not directly involved with.  The elite (bureaucracy) was only concerned with official missions and held an elitist view regarding the merchants and other commoners that partook in trade with neighboring societies and cultures, which contributes to the manner in which Buddhism was able to infiltrate these societies.  Buddhism followed the same routes the merchants used. As Buddhism spread, so did the demand for religious artifacts and literature. Buddhism also stimulated religious pilgrimages which in turn stimulated trade.  These factors stimulated the growth of local economies and the production of artifacts and the printing of religious texts. This all often went unnoticed by the elite who would otherwise have been vehemently opposed to the spread of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" &gt;Holcombe, Charles.  “Trade-Buddhism:  Maritime Trade, Immigration, and the Buddhist	Landfall in Early Japan.”  Journal of the American Oriental Society.  vol. 119, no.	2, (Apr.-June 1999), 280-292. (pages 280-281)&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the stimulation of commerce and travel, Buddhism assisted trade by providing a social lubricant.  As Holcombe states, “The Buddhist spirit minimized regional differences.”&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(283)  Because of its universalistic philosophy, followers of the religion from different cultures who behaved differently, looked different, and so on, were still able to engage in commerce because they held a common faith.  This in turn helped to propel the spread of Buddhism to other regions.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(282-283)

Buddhist missionaries would accompany private trading caravans and sailing vessels along established trade routes into regions that were untouched by Buddhism.  Sometimes those missionaries would settle in these regions and establish schools/missions or, during the voyage, would convert merchants and traders who would in turn settle in these new regions, raising families, and assisting in the dissemination of the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(285)  Sometimes this immigration was accidental, as in the case with Japan. At the time sailing between Japan, China, and Korea was a dangerous affair, so it is understandable that many of these “immigrants” would opt to remain in Japan (or wherever it was they landed), as happened with ten Paekche monks blown off course as they were sailing to China. The elite, for the most part, ignored travelers that were not members of official missions so it is plausible that the number of immigrants such as the Paekche monks was much higher than the official immigrant count indicates.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(288-289)

Commerce and trade facilitated the spread of Buddhism to new regions and with it the spread of Buddhist texts which stimulated the growth of printing industries.  The extensive book trade between Sung China and Korea as well as the employment of Chinese monks by Japanese temples and monasteries was a common practice.  It is very important to keep in mind the role commerce played in the printing of Buddhist texts.

== Conclusion ==
As mentioned above, the Japanese case provides the best example of how Buddhism influenced printing.  In China the religion was a populist one, which actively sought out those that were marginalized by Confucian society.  Korea had a voracious appetite for Buddhist texts and the combination of the scarcity of resources for woodblock printing as well as the Mongol invasions stimulated the use of new printing technologies.  As Mair writes, “There is little doubt that printing in East Asia, from its inception, was primarily a Buddhist phenomenon.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(736)  Buddhism, being a universalistic and populist religion, as well as its zealous conversion of the common person to its faith, was able to utilize print technology like no other religion at the time was able to.  The ostensibly oral origins of the religion allowed Buddhism to utilize vernacular language in the printed form to reach a much wider audience than Confucianism, Taoism, or other religions.  So in this way Buddhism was able to wield an influence on print technology that was unknown before its introduction to East Asia.

In [[literary theory]] and [[philosophy of language]], the '''chronotope''' is how configurations of time and space are represented in [[language]] and [[discourse]]. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar [[Bakhtin|M.M. Bakhtin]] who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian ''{{lang|ru|xронотоп}}'', which in turn is derived from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|χρόνος}}'' ('[[time]]') and ''{{lang|grc|τόπος}}'' ('[[space]]'); it thus can be literally translated as "time-space." Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" ({{lang|ru|Формы времени и хронотопа в романе}}). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84–258|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In the [[philosophy of language]] and [[philology]], Bakhtin scholars [[Caryl Emerson]] and [[Michael Holquist]] state that the chronotope is "a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular [[genre]]s, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular [[worldview]]s or [[ideology|ideologies]]. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.

In "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:

{{quote|text=We will give the name chronotope (literally, "time space") to the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature. This term [space-time] is employed in mathematics, and was introduced as part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The special meaning it has in relativity theory is not important for our purposes; we are borrowing it for literary criticism almost as a metaphor (almost, but not entirely). What counts for us is the fact that it expresses the inseparability of space and time (time as the fourth dimension of space). We understand the chronotope as a formally constitutive category of literature; we will not deal with the chronotope in other areas of culture.' In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope.
The chronotope in literature has an intrinsic generic significance. It can even be said that it is precisely the chronotope that defines genre and generic distinctions, for in literature the primary category in the chronotope is time. The chronotope as a formally constitutive category determines to a significant degree the image of man in literature as well. The image of man is always intrinsically chronotopic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=M.|year=1981|chapter=Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel|title=In The Dialogic Imagination|pages=84-85|location=Austin|publisher=Univ. Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Examples ==
The concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as [[Robert Frost]]'s poem "The Road Not Taken" or [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''The Grapes of Wrath'', where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Timo|title=Notes Toward an Ecological Conception of Bakhtin’s ‘Chronotope.’|url=http://ecozona.eu/article/viewFile/327/301|date=2010}}; {{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Timo|chapter=The Ecology of Literary Chronotopes|title=Handbook of Ecocriticism and Cultural Ecology|date=2016|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/206422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropologist [[Keith Basso]] invoked "chronotopes" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the [[Western Apache]] of "the moral teachings of their history" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning "it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining "with outsiders against members of their own community." Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are "points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).

Anthropologist of syncretism [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/safet-hadzimuhamedovic/index.html Safet HadžiMuhamedović] built upon [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin’s]] term in his ethnography of the [[Gatačko Polje|Field of Gacko]] in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/HadziMuhamedovicWaiting ''Waiting for'' ''Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape''], he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus '''''"schizochronotopic"''''' (from the Greek σχίζειν (''skhizein''): "to split").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape|last=HadžiMuhamedović|first=Safet|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78533-856-4|location=New York and Oxford|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described two overarching chronotopes as "collective timespace themes", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, '''''schizochronotopia''''' is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. 

The chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and [[Peter Renshaw]] in order to view "student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that "blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives" (2013: 53).

A '''church fan''' is term used mainly in the [[United States]] for a [[hand fan]] used within a [[Christian church]] building to cool oneself off. The fan typically has a wooden handle and a fan blade made of hard stock paper (i.e. card-stock, 2-ply), often with a staple adjoining the two materials.

== History ==
Modern air-conditioning became widely available in America during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/|title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning|date=2015-01-01|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many churches (primarily African-American congregations) were unable to afford the cooling machines for their [[church (building)|church buildings]]. In addition to their function of cooling the body, the paper blade of the fans were used for printed illustrations and community advertisements. Historically, funeral homes often acquired the space on the back of the fans to advertise their services to the churches members, in addition to other local businesses and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20100306/collection-of-church-fans-represents-southern-hospitality|title=Collection of church fans represents Southern hospitality|last=Greene|first=Amanda|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations on the front blade of the fans are varied in subject matter; from illustrations of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], to notable people within the respective churches community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myauctionfinds.com/2014/07/23/a-time-when-hand-fans-cooled-church-goers/|title=A time when hand fans cooled church-goers {{!}} Auction Finds|website=myauctionfinds.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Use ==
With the spread of modern air-conditioning units within church buildings, church fans have become less popular. However, many churches still supply hand fans for their members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">'''Coh-Metrix''' is a computational tool that produces indices of the [[natural language|linguistic]] and [[discourse]] representations of a text. Developed by
[[Arthur C. Graesser]] and [[Danielle McNamara]], Coh-Metrix calculates the [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] of texts on many different measures.

==Coh-Metrix Measurements==
Coh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of the explicit text and the coherence of the [[mental representation]] of the text. "Our definition of [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] consists of characteristics of the explicit text that play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the text" (Graesser, McNamara, &amp; Louwerse, 2003). The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate. Theoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between linguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can be defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are likely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix measurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Graesser,A.C., McNamara,D.S.,&amp; Louwerse,M.M (2003).   What do readers need to learn in order to process coherence relations in narrative and expository text.  In A.P. Sweet and C.E. Snow (Eds.), Rethinking reading comprehension (pp.&amp;nbsp;82–98). New York: Guilford Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an empirical study, the Coh-Metrix L2 Reading Index performs significantly better than traditional [[readability]] formulas.&lt;ref&gt;

Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture.

Their usage can be seen in cultural expressions, [[phraseologism]]s, [[jokes]], [[slogan]]s, [[literature]], [[religion]], [[folklore]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], etc.&lt;ref name="elies"&gt;[http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD11/LD11-05-Lucia.pdf Luque Nadal, L. (2009): "Los culturemas: ¿unidades lingüísticas, ideológicas o culturales?" en Language Design 11, págs. 93-120] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which are subcultures in a culture system. Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in [[translation studies]] and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.&lt;ref name="elies" /&gt;

== Phases of a Cultureme ==

Fernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654436579|title=The Mutual interaction of people and their built environment : a cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|others=Rapoport, Amos., International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (9th : 1973 : Chicago)|year=|isbn=9789027979094|location=The Hague|pages=265–274|oclc=654436579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase One: Basic Culturemes ===

'''Basic culturemes''' are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural "realms," '''urban''' and '''rural''', and two domains: exterior and interior.  Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions.  Within either cultures, there are '''exteriors''' (what is observed from the outside) and '''interiors''' (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective).  The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural-interior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance,

&lt;blockquote href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;"in ''North America'' (United States and Canada): the larger size of many automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=11|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Phase Two: Primary Culturemes ===
'''Primary culturemes''' exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into '''environmental''' (cultural settings) and '''behavioral''' (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and "experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=12|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase Three: Secondary Culturemes ===
Culturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc.  These are '''secondary culturemes'''. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phase Four: Tertiary Culturemes ===
Phase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible.  The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Translation ==
Translating a cultureme can be challenging, as [[connotation]]s are sometimes very strong. For instance: the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''alcázar'' means "the castle", "palace" or "fortress", but, as it is of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, it recalls eight centuries of history ([[Al Andalus]]), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word "fortress" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the [[loan word]] [[Alcázar|alcazar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum24/secciones/tritonos-3-culturemas.htm Translation of culturemes for tourism] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaskot|first=Maciej Paweł|last2=Ganoshenko|first2=Iurii|date=2015-12-31|title=Culturemes and Non-Equivalent Lexis in Dictionaries|url=https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/cs-ec/article/view/cs.2015.009|journal=Cognitive Studies {{!}} Études cognitives|language=|volume=|issue=15|pages=115–124|doi=10.11649/cs.2015.009|issn=2392-2397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturemes are translated in several ways:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;Literal translation: Language of the cultureme is rendered in another language in attempts to convey the same core meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional equivalence: Translating meaning without the inclusion of its cultural association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Near-synonymy: A translation has a similar meaning to the cultureme without being identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under-specification: A space-saving technique that give a short and manageable definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion: A translation that does not preserve the same meaning as the cultureme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explanation: A translator uses this technique in their efforts to get the audience to fully understand the meaning. This can involve lengthy and overly detailed descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Category change: In the instance that the cultureme is obsolete or no longer relevant, a modern-day equivalent is provided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glossary: A given text provides a definition at the end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="International Standard Book Number"&gt;Over-specification: More information is given than required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No translation: Some culturemes are kept in their original language. This applies mainly to [[Latin script|Roman script]] languages, though other languages may have their culturemes [[Romanization|romanized]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omission: The translator may omit what they judge to be peripheral in what is meant to be said.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolae|first=Adina Oana|date=2015|title=Multicultural dialogue: translating culturemes|url=|journal=Discourse as a Form of Multiculturalism in Literature and Communication|language=|volume=3|pages=215–222|doi=|isbn=978-606-8624-21-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Culture: Norms, Ideas, and Materials ===

In translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its "cultureme" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=603–621|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Norms''' refer to the habits and traditions of a societal group. A culture with a foundation of politeness that uses [[honorific]] terms of address, such as in the [[Korean language|Korean]] language, has very intricate forms of pronouns that have nonequivalence in other languages, e.g. English. Different cultures and languages have different interpretations of politeness that affects how successful a cultureme is translated. Traditional holidays are norms in a culture. The Vietnamese New Year ''[[Tết]]'' is a cultureme of the Vietnamese language and culture. ''Tết'' signifies the start of the new year on the [[Lunar calendar]]. It is a day of being home with family and cheerful celebration. A literal translation of ''Tết'' to English would be "New Year." But, anyone who had no knowledge of the cultureme would think the traditions and practices of "New Year's" all the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;*'''Ideas''' refer to "scientific truths, religious beliefs, myths, legends, works of literature, superstitions, aphorisms, proverbs, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=614|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These culturemes are deep rooted in shared, personal history that outsiders of a culture are unfamiliar with knowing. Culturemes pertaining to cultural ideas do not need explained in the present, their meanings and significance are cemented in the people's knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Materials''' refer to physical culture. Food, for instance, is a important example of tangible culture; it can illustrate dietary culture/lifestyle. Certain dishes are staples of the culture and can be a product of the local surroundings. The existence of a food or dish may have historical relevance to a culture. Translation in recipes that involve food cultureme can result in the wrong ingredients being introduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Deterritorialization''' ({{lang-fr|déterritorialisation}}) is a [[concept]] created by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). The term "deterritorialization" first occurs in French [[psychoanalytic]] theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures ([[Deleuze]] &amp; [[Guattari]] 1972).

Its most common use, however, has been in relation to the process of [[cultural globalization]]. Though there are different inflections involved, the general implication that [[globalization]] needs to be understood in cultural-spatial terms as much as in institutional or political-economic ones is common to all accounts&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. In this broad sense, deterritorialization has affinities with the idea of the "disembedding" of social relations in, for example, [[Anthony Giddens]]'s (1990) analysis of the globalizing properties of [[modernity]].

==Overview==
''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) distinguishes between  [[wikt:relative|relative]] and an [[wikt:absolute|absolute]] deterritorialization. Relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization, while positive absolute deterritorialization is more akin to the construction of a "[[plane of immanence]]", akin to [[Spinoza]]'s [[ontological]] constitution of the world.{{Ref|Negri}} There is also a negative sort of absolute deterritorialization, for example in the [[subjectivation]] process (''the face''). 

The function of deterritorialization is defined as "the movement by which one leaves a territory", also known as a "line of flight"&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;. Still, deterritorialization "constitutes and extends" the territory itself&lt;ref&gt;Papastergiadis, N., 2018. The turbulence of migration: Globalization, deterritorialization and hybridity. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In anthropology==
When referring to culture, anthropologists use the term '''deterritorialized''' to refer to a weakening of ties between culture and place. This means the removal of cultural subjects and objects from a certain location in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=Holy Ignorance:  When Religion and Culture Part Ways|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-932802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies that certain cultural aspects tend to transcend specific territorial boundaries in a world that consists of things fundamentally in motion.

==In the context of cultural globalization==
In the context of [[cultural globalization]], some{{Weasel inline|date=September 2016}} argue deterritorialization is a cultural feature developed by the "[[mediatization]], migration, and [[commodification]] which characterize globalized [[modernity]]". This implies that by people working towards closer involvement with the whole of the world, and works towards lessening the gap with one another, one may be widening the gap with what is physically close to them.

According to the works of [[Arjun Appadurai]], this cultural distancing from the locality, is intensified when people are able to expand and alter their imagination through the mediatization of alien cultural conditions, making this culture of remote origin one of a familiar material. This makes it difficult for a local entity to sustain and retain its own local cultural identity, which also affects the national identity of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, G. M. (2002). ''The deterritorialization of cultural heritage'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun. (1990). ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Appadurai's 1990 essay "Disjuncture and Difference": "Deterritorialization, in general, is one of the central forces of the modern world because it brings laboring populations in to the lower-class sectors and spaces of relatively wealthy societies, while sometimes creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home state. Deterritorialization, whether of Hindus, Sikhs, Palestinians, or Ukrainians, is now at the core of a variety of global [[fundamentalism]]s, including [[Islamic]] and [[Hindu]] fundamentalism. In the Hindu case, for example, it is clear that the overseas movement of Indians has been exploited by a variety of interests both within and outside India to create a complicated network of finances and religious identifications, by which the problem of cultural reproduction for Hindus abroad has become tied to the politics of Hindu fundamentalism at home.

At the same time, deterritorialization creates new markets for film companies, art impressions, and travel agencies, which thrive on the end of the deterritorialized population for contact with its homeland. Naturally, these invented homelands, which constitute the [[mediascape]]s of deterritorialized groups, can often become sufficiently fantastic and one-sided that they provide the material for new ideoscapes in which ethnic conflicts can begin to erupt."  (Appadurai 1990:11–12)

===Deterritorialization and reterritorialization===
Deterritorialization and [[reterritorialization]] exist simultaneously. In [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]]'s follow-up to [[Anti-Oedipus]], [[A Thousand Plateaus]], they distinguish between relative deterritorialization, which is always accompanied by reterritorialization, and absolute deterritorialization, which gives rise to a plane of immanence. In both forms of deterritorialization, however, the idea of physical territory remains just that, an idea and reference point.

Mediatization works as a preferential source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a catalyser of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As [[Tomlinson]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, J. (1999): Globalization and Culture, Chicago. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up to the world and amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as "certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions".&lt;ref&gt;García Canclini, N. (1990): Culturas híbridas: estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad, Mexico. Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes/Grijalbo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both sides of the same coin of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, R. (1992): Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture, London. Sage. – (2000): "Globalización: tiempo-espacio y homogeneidad-heterogeneidad", Zona Abierta, 92/93, pp. 213-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the "natural" relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As [[Giddens]] argues, "the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages". Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a [[relativization]] and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1990) The Consequences of Modernity, Cambridge. Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement===
Although the process of across-boundaries flow was imbalanced, it cannot be denied that it has profound influence on politics, economics, and culture from every dimension. Although there were imbalanced power presences in different nations, it is undeniable that people will gradually realize that in addition to their own lives around are mutually implicated in the distant shore, but also to reconcile the impact between their lives around and the distant side. That is, the flow process of beyond the boundaries not only the representatives of strengthening interdependence, but also representatives that they both have the cognitive of [[globalization]]. It formed an easily comprehensive characteristics about "superterritorial" and "transworld". In other words, the original divide in the territorial boundaries between them have lost some authority, what is the main phenomenon of deterritorialization.&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, Jan Aart. 2005. Globalization: A Critical Introduction. Basingstoke/New York: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no matter from what angle to explore globalization, deterritorialization has been a general consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, Wendy and William Walters. 2004. "Globalization as Governmentality," Alternatives. Vol.29, pp. 495-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "deterritorialization" may have different meanings. [[Tomlinson]] had pointed out that many scholars use the vocabulary of deterritorialization to explain the process of globalization, however, there are still some scholars who prefer the use of related words, such as "[[delocalization]]" or "[[Forced migration|displacement]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson. 1999. Globalization and Culture. pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized different point in the use of different terms, but basically we can understand the meaning of these words that is to understand the transformation between local and cultures of the global modernity. In the text of Tomlinson, however, we found that he uses "deterritorialization" to explain the phenomenon instead of using "delocalization". But we can unearth that "deterritorialization" was more focused on liberating the people from the "local", is a process which no longer just only affected by neighborhood and familiar local, but also deeply influenced by the distant place.

As sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] indicated, the most immediate experience of global modernity, in fact, is we stay in our own familiar environment but feel the feeling of living in different places because of globalization. Say in other words, the local has hardly affected by the distance place, however, under the impact of globalization, distant events made its influence reach into your daily life in the environment, which is the concept of "displacement". Due to the space experiences which were combined with neighboring and distant in people's daily life, it can be said that globalization has fundamentally changed our concept of the space.

===Disjunctive relationships===
However, communication technology may act not only to fill the field of local cultural significance and identity which corroded by deterritorialization, but also to establish global cultural politics. Politics of deterritorialization and the displacement of [[sociological]] will lead the struggle between state and nation.  One important new feature of global cultural politics, tied to the [[disjunctive population|disjunctive]] relationships among the various landscapes which proposed by Appadurai, is that state and nation are at each other's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

The '''European Master in Management''' (EMM) is a 2-year general management master program run jointly by [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (France), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (Germany) and [[Lancaster University Management School]] (UK). The purpose of the program is to allow students to study international business from a European and global perspective.

The European Master in Management is '''''a triple master's degree based in the France, Germany and the UK'''''. After completing all program requirements, '''''students are awarded three [[Master of Science|MSc]] Diplomas: one from each of the Partner Universities'''''. The EMM was the first European triple-degree program.

The objective of the EMM is to prepare students for a wide range of career possibilities all focused on global business through a combination of academic periods on different campuses, in-company internships, and a unique multicultural European experience with a great diversity in the student body. The first year is devoted to general management courses, whereas the second year is dedicated to a specialization in [[Corporate finance|Corporate Finance]], [[Marketing]], Strategy &amp; Change or [[Corporate development|Corporate Development]].

When the program was launched, in 2007, [[Aston Business School]] was the program's Partner University in the UK. After Aston Business School left the partnership, the program was run as a double degree master from EMLYON Business School and Ludwig Maximilian Universität (Germany) until Lancaster University Management School joined the partnership, bringing it back to a triple degree program.

==Program==

In the first year, students stay on the same campus ([[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]]) and are provided with a broad foundation of management knowledge. Each fundamental management course gives students a broader perspective of global business, as it is designed and taught jointly by a team of professors from [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU]] and [[Lancaster University Management School|LUMS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/classes-teaching-methods&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second year, students take on an elective specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/Specialisations&lt;/ref&gt; This is an opportunity to study at a new campus, depending on the specialization chosen:
* [[Corporate Finance]] at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon or at the Asian Campus in Shanghai)
* Marketing at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon)
* Strategy &amp; Change at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (at the campus in Munich)
* Corporate Development at [[Lancaster University Management School]] (at the campus in Lancaster)

Students spend at least one semester in a company, on a management internship, and must write a professionally oriented Master's Dissertation. This provides the opportunity to strengthen relations with the business world.

==European Master in Management Partners Companies==

Throughout the year, students have multiple opportunities to contact with the corporate partners. Different companies are frequently represented on campus, either to give lectures and seminars or to offer internship and job opportunities directly to the students.

Some of the main partner companies are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Careers-Network/partner-companies&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}
In English [[common law]], '''fee tail''' or '''entail''' is a form of [[Trust law|trust]] established by deed or settlement which restricts the sale or [[inheritance]] of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] and prevents the property from being sold, devised by [[Will (law)|will]], or otherwise [[Alienation (property law)|alienated]] by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically by [[operation of law]] to an heir pre-determined by the settlement deed. The term ''fee tail'' is from  [[Medieval Latin]] ''feodum talliatum'', which means "cut(-short) [[fiefdom|fee]]", and is in contrast to "[[fee simple]]" where no such restriction exists and where the possessor has an absolute title (although subject to the [[allodial title]] of the monarch) in the property which he can bequeath or otherwise dispose of as he wishes. Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere.

==Purpose==
The fee tail allowed a patriarch to perpetuate his blood-line, family-name, honour and armorials&lt;ref&gt;Frequently in default of a son and heir to the tenant-in-possession, the entail required the next male heir, if via a female line, to adopt the surname and arms of the patriarch, see for example [[Mark Rolle]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the persons of a series of powerful and wealthy male descendants. By keeping his estate intact in the hands of one heir alone, in an ideally indefinite and pre-ordained chain of succession, his own wealth, power and family honour would not be dissipated amongst several male lines, as became the case for example in Napoleonic France by operation of the [[Napoleonic Code]] which gave each child the legal right to inherit an equal share of the patrimony, where a formerly great landowning family could be reduced in a few generations to a series of small-holders or peasant farmers. It therefore approaches the true [[corporation]] which is a legal body or person which does not die and continues in existence and can hold wealth indefinitely. Indeed, as a form of trust, whilst the individual trustees may die, replacements are appointed and the trust itself continues, ideally indefinitely. In England almost seamless successions were made from patriarch to patriarch, the smoothness of which were often enhanced by baptising the eldest son and heir with his father's Christian name for several generations, for example the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all named Fulk. Such indefinite inalienable land-holdings were soon seen as restrictive on the optimum productive ability of land, which was often converted to deer-parks or pleasure grounds by the wealthy tenant-in-possession, which was damaging to the nation as a whole, and thus laws against perpetuities were enacted, which restricted entails to a maximum number of lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An entail also had the effect of disabling [[illegitimate child]]ren from inheriting. It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in [[debt]], often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch's widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute. Frequently in such cases the generosity of the settlor left the entailed estate as an uneconomical enterprise, especially during times when the estate's fluctuating agricultural income had to provide for fixed sum annuities. Such impoverished tenants-in-possession were unable to realise in cash any part of their land or even to offer the property as security for a loan, to pay such annuities, unless sanctioned by private Act of Parliament  allowing such sale, which expensive and time-consuming mechanism was frequently resorted to. The ''beneficial owner'' (or tenant-in-possession) of the property in fact had only a [[life interest]] in it, albeit an absolute right to the income it generated, the ''legal owners'' being the trustees of the settlement, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] passing intact to the next [[Inheritance|successor]] or [[heir]] in law; any purported bequest of the land by the tenant-in-possession was ineffective.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
Fee tail was established during [[feudal]] times by [[landed gentry]] to attempt to ensure that the high social standing of the family, as represented by a single patriarch, continued indefinitely. The concentration of the family's wealth into the hands of a single representative was essential to support this  process. Unless the heir had himself inherited the personal and intellectual strengths of the original great patriarch, often a great warrior, which alone had brought him from obscurity to greatness, he would soon sink again into obscurity, and required wealth to maintain his social standing. This feature of English gentry and aristocracy differs from the true aristocracy which existed in pre-[[French Revolution|Revolution]] France, where all sons of a nobleman inherited his title and were thus inescapably members of a separate noble caste in society. In England all younger sons of a nobleman were born as mere gentlemen and [[commoner]]s, and without the support of wealth  could quickly descend into obscurity, the eldest son alone being a nobleman. On this eldest son was concentrated the honour of the family, and to him alone was granted all its wealth to support his role in that regard, by the process of the fee tail.

===Statute of Westminster 1285===
The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster II]], passed in 1285, created and fixed the form of this estate. The new law was also formally called the statute ''[[De Donis Conditionalibus]]'' (Concerning Conditional Gifts).

===Opponents===
Fee tail was  never popular with the monarchy, the merchant class and many holders of entailed estates themselves who wished to sell their land.

===Abolition===
Fee tail as a legal [[estate (law)|estate]] in England was abolished by the [[Law of Property Act 1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=Jonathan|title=A Dictionary of Law|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199664927|page=258|edition=Eighth|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=nTrvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing use===
A fee tail can still exist in England and Wales as an equitable interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested in the current 'tenant for life' or other person immediately entitled to the income, but on the basis that any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e. a [[future interest]] where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any 'special protectors' to vest a [[reversion (law)|reversionary]] fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a [[base fee]]; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.   No new "fees tail" can now be created following the [[Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/schedule/1/paragraph/5 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 Schedule 1 Para 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[conservation easement]]s are a form of entail still in use.

==Creation==
Traditionally, a fee tail was created by a trust established in a [[deed]], often a [[marriage settlement]], or in a will "to A and the heirs of his body". The crucial difference between the words of conveyance and the words that created a [[fee simple]] ("to A and his heirs") is that the heirs "in tail" must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have "fee tail male", which only sons could inherit, and "fee tail female", which only daughters could inherit; and "fee tail special", which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain "heirs of the body" and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions was said to be "entailed" or "held in-tail", with the restrictions themselves known as ''entailments''.

==Breaking of fee tail==
The breaking of a fee tail was simplified by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1833/cukpga_18330074_en_1#l1g3 Fines and Recoveries Act 1833 s.15]&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the conveyance for making a tenant to the [[praecipe]] for suffering a common recovery. This was the usual preliminary to a recovery with a disentailing assurance, which had to be enrolled. The need for this to be followed by the [[Legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]] of a common recovery was abolished.

The requirement that a disentailing assurance should be enrolled was abolished in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Property Act 1925, s. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mortgage of entailed lands==
Lending upon security of a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] on land in fee tail was risky, since at the death of the tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor in fee tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore  impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Failure of issue==
{{main article|Failure of issue}}
Things did not always go as planned, however. Tenants-in-possession of entailed estates occasionally suffered "failure of issue" – that is, they had no legitimate children surviving them at the time of their deaths. In this situation the entailed land devolved to male cousins, i.e. back up and through the family tree to legitimate male descendants of former tenants-in-possession, or reverted to the last owner in fee simple, if still living. This situation produced complicated [[litigation]] and was an incentive for the production and maintenance of detailed and authoritative family pedigrees and supporting records of marriage, births, baptisms etc.

Depending on how the original deed or grant was worded, in the event of there being daughters but no sons, all the sisters might inherit jointly, it might pass to the eldest sister, it might be held in trust until one of them should produce a (legitimate) son, or it might pass to the next male-line relative (an uncle, say, or even a cousin, sometimes very distant).

==Common recovery==
In the 15th century, lawyers devised  "[[common recovery]]", an elaborate legal procedure which used collaborative lawsuits and [[legal fiction]]s to "bar" a fee tail, that is to say to remove the restrictions of fee tail from land and to enable its conveyance in fee simple.  Biancalana's book ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176–1502'' (2001) discusses the procedure and its history at length.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Biancalana, ''The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176-1502'', Cambridge Studies in English Legal History, 2001.  520 pages. {{ISBN|0521032946}} (2007 reprint).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement==
In the 17th and 18th centuries the practice arose whereby when the son came of age (at 21), he and his father acting together could bar the existing fee tail, and could then re-settle the land in fee tail, again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, but at the same time making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father's widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father's lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.

==Formedon==
Formedon (or ''form down'' etc.) was a right of writ exercisable by a holder in fee for claiming property entailed by a lessee beyond the terms of his feoffment.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} A letter dated 1539 from the [[Lisle Letters]] describes the circumstances of its use:&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981, vol.5, letter 1359, p.408, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I received your ladyship's letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one estate in tail to him and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir [[William Coffin (courtier)|William Coffyn]] in his life. Howbeit Mr Richard Coffyn, next heir to Sir William Coffyn, claimeth the same by his uncle's feoffment to him and to his heirs so that the law will put Mr John Basset from his entry and to compel him to take his action of ''form down'' which is much dilatory as Mr Basset knoweth&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Marquess of Hertford===
An English example of a fee tail may be the main estates of the wealthy art collector [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]] (d. 1870). His only child was his illegitimate son, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet]], to whom he left as much of his property as he could. The main land holdings and [[Ragley Hall]] were inherited by his distant cousin, [[Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford]], descended from a younger son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|1st Marquess]] who had died in 1794. Most of the 4th Marquess's art collection had been acquired by himself or his father, went to Wallace, and is now the [[Wallace Collection]]. Other works were covered by the fee tail, however, and passed to the 5th Marquess.

===Earl of Pembroke===
Another example was [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]], who died in 1827. He had quarreled with his eldest son, later the [[Robert Herbert, 12th Earl of Pembroke|12th Earl]], and left his unentailed estate to [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea]], his son by a second marriage.

==Fees tail in fiction==
Fees tail figure in the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of several well known [[novel]]s and stories, particularly in the 19th century, including:

* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]]
* ''[[Middlemarch]]'' by [[George Eliot]]
* ''[[The Belton Estate]]'' (1866) and ''[[Ralph the Heir]]'' (1871) by [[Anthony Trollope]]
* ''[[The Master of Ballantrae]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]
* ''[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]
* ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]]
* ''[[Wideacre]]'' by [[Philippa Gregory]]
* ''[[The Quincunx]]'' by [[Charles Palliser]] (written in 1989, but it takes the form of a Dickensian mystery set in early-19th-century England)
* ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' by [[Julian Fellowes]]&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2015/04/The-Tale-of-the-Fee-Tail-in-Downton-Abbey.pdf The Tale of the Fee Tail in ''Downton Abbey'']", J. B. Ruhl, Vanderbilt Law Review, April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (written in 2009–2015, but set in England in the period 1912–1927)
* ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by Harper Lee (referred to as an "entailment")

===''Pride and Prejudice''===
''Pride and Prejudice'' contains a particularly thorny example of the kind of problems which could arise through the entailing of property. Mr. Bennet, the father of protagonist [[Elizabeth Bennet]], had only a life interest in the Longbourn estate, the family's home and principal source of income. He had no authority to dictate to whom it should pass upon his death, as it was strictly arranged to be inherited by the next male heir. Had Mr. Bennet fathered a son it would have passed to him, but since he did not it could not pass to any of his five daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Martin|title=Modern Land Law|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317821459|edition=Ninth|page=8 (footnote)|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ro78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the next nearest male heir would inherit the property—Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a boorish minister in his mid-twenties. The inheritance of the Longbourn property completely excluded the five Bennet daughters, who were thus to lose their home and income upon their father's death. The need for the daughters to make a good marriage to ensure their future security is a key motivation for many episodes in the novel. Many fees tail arose from wills, rather than from marriage settlements which usually made some provision for daughters. Austen was very familiar with the law of entail; her brother, Edward, had inherited similarly entailed estates at [[Chawton]], [[Godmersham]] and [[Winchester]] from distant cousins under the will of Elizabeth Knight, who died in 1737.&lt;ref name=grover&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=Christine|title=Edward Knight’s Inheritance: The Chawton, Godmersham, and Winchester Estates|journal=Persuasions|date=2013|volume=34|issue=1|url=http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol34no1/grover.html|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Scotland===
{{main article|Tailzie}}
In [[Scotland]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] (section 50) abolished all feudal tenures including the entail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/50 ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act'' 2000, section 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the doctrines of ''[[legitime|legitim]]'' and ''[[jus relictae]]'' restrict owners from willing property out of their family when they die with children or have a surviving partner.

A Scottish example of fee tail is the case of [[Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton]], who in 1895 inherited from the 12th Duke, his fourth cousin, who had attempted to marry his daughter to the heir.

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 abolished the fee tail in Ireland and converted existing fees tail to [[fee simple|fees simple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/sec0013.html#sec13 ''Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act'' 2009, section 13.]&lt;/ref&gt; For constitutional reasons, this section is subject to a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to fees simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, fees tail still exist in Ireland.

===United States===
The fee tail has been abolished in all but four states in the [[United States]]: [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]]. However, in the first three states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant's children. [[New York (state)|New York]] abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a [[fee simple]]; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.

In [[Louisiana]], the common law concept of estates in land never existed.  The concept of forced heirship and the marital portion protects force heirs and surviving spouses from total divestment of value of the estate of the decedent, who has a duty to provide for their care.

Fee tail-like restrictions still exist though contractual obligations. For example, owners of [[inholdings]] inside public lands may be prevented from selling or gifting their land to non-family members. In this case, the restrictions result from an agreement between the government and the land owner, and is not a part of a deed or settlement.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and later in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], fee tail estates were called ''ordynacja'' ({{IPA-pl|ɔrdɨˈnatsja|lang}}; landed property in ''fideicommis''). ''Ordynacja'' was an economic institution for governing of landed property introduced in late 16th century by king [[Stefan Batory]]. ''Ordynacja'' was abolished by the [[agricultural reform]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. ''Ordynat'' was the [[title]] of the principal [[heir]] of ''ordynacja''.

According to the rules of ''ordynacja'', which became a statute approved by the [[Sejm]]&lt;!--when?--&gt;, the estate was not to be divided between the heirs but inherited in full by the eldest son ([[primogeniture]]).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;Peter Paul Bajer. "[http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm Short history of the Radziwill Family]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231031433/http://www.szlachta.org/2radziwill.htm |date=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from inheritance ([[Salic Law]]).&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; ''Ordynacja'' could not be sold or [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

''Ordynacja'' was similar to the French law of ''[[majorat]]'' or German and Scandinavian ''fideicommis'',&lt;!-- Link to [[fee tail]] removed - not mentioned at that article --&gt; and succession to such resembles that of British [[peerages]].

Many Polish [[magnate]]s' fortunes were based on ''ordynacja'', among them those of the [[Radziwiłł]]s, [[Zamoyski]]s, [[Czartoryski]]s, [[Potocki]]s and [[Lubomirski]]s. Most important ''ordynacja'' were veritable little [[principalities]]. The earliest and most extensive ''ordynacjas'' include:
* [[Ordynacje Radziwiłłów]], created for [[Mikołaj VII Radziwiłł]], [[Albrecht Radziwiłł]] and [[Stanisław Radziwiłł]] in 1589, centered on [[Olyka]], [[Nesvizh]], and [[Kletsk]]
* [[Ordynacja Ostrogska]], created for [[Janusz Ostrogski]] in 1609, later inherited by the [[Zaslawski]], [[Lubomirski]] and [[Sanguszko]] families, centered on [[Ostroh]]
* [[Ordynacja Zamojska]], created for [[Jan Zamoyski]] in 1589, centered on [[Zamość]]
* [[Ordynacja Jarosławska]], created for [[Rafał Jarosławski]] in 1470, centered on [[Jarosław]]
* [[Ordynacja Pińczowska]], created for Piotr and Zygmunt [[Myszkowski]] in 1601, later inherited by the [[Wielopolski family]], centered on [[Pińczów]]

Other European legal systems had comparable devices to keep estates together, especially in Spain and Northern European countries like [[Prussia]]. They are derived from ''[[fideicommissum]]'', a legal institution in [[Roman law]]. Unlike most of the English aristocracy, the [[Prussian Junkers|Prussian ''junkers'']] supported fees tail, and succeeded in reinstating them in 1853, after they had been abolished in a recent Constitution. In Germany and Austria the ''Familienfideikommiss'' was only abolished in 1938, and in [[Scandinavia]] they persisted even later – a few old Swedish fees tail still remain in force, though no new ones may be established. For the law of German and Austrian fideicommissa in particular, an 862-page manual by the German legal scholar [[Philipp Knipschildt]], entitled ''Tractatus de fideicommissis nobilium familiarum – von Stammgütern'' ({{Google books|V2tBAAAAcAAJ|De fideicommissis}}), was the standard reference work. First published in 1654, this grand systematization of existing legal opinion was frequently reprinted and continued to be consulted until well into the 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18701">{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

'''Fictive kinship''' is a term used by [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]] to describe forms of [[kinship]] or social ties that are based on neither [[consanguinity|consanguineal]] (blood ties) nor [[Affinity (law)|affinal]] ("by marriage") ties, in contrast to ''true kinship'' ties.

To the extent that consanguineal and affinal kinship ties might be considered ''real'' or ''true'' kinship, the term ''fictive kinship'' has in the past been used to refer to those kinship ties that are ''fictive'', in the sense of ''not-real''. Invoking the concept as a cross-culturally valid anthropological category therefore rests on the presumption that the inverse category of "(true) kinship" built around consanguinity and affinity is similarly cross-culturally valid. Use of the term was common until the mid-to-late twentieth century, when anthropology effectively deconstructed and revised many of the concepts and categories around the study of kinship and social ties. In particular, anthropologists established that a consanguinity basis for kinship ties is not universal across cultures, and that—on the contrary—it may be a culturally specific symbol of kinship only in particular cultures (see the articles on [[kinship]] and [[David M. Schneider]] for more information on the history of kinship studies).

Stemming from anthropology's early connections to legal studies, the term ''fictive kinship'' may also be used in a legal sense, and this use continues in societies where these categories and definitions regarding kinship and social ties have legal currency; e.g. in matters of inheritance.

As part of the deconstruction of kinship mentioned above, anthropologists now recognize that—cross-culturally—the kinds of social ties and relationships formerly treated under the category of "kinship" are very often not necessarily predicated on blood ties or marriage ties, and may rather be based on shared residence, shared economic ties, [[nurture kinship]], or familiarity via other forms of interaction.

In [[sociology of the family]], this idea is referred to as '''chosen kin''', '''fictive kin''' or '''voluntary kin'''. Sociologists define the concept as a form of extended family members who are not related by either blood or marriage. The bonds allowing for chosen kinship may include religious rituals, close friendship ties,&lt;ref name=Ebaugh&gt;Ebaugh, Helen Rose, and Mary Curry. "Fictive kin as social capital in new immigrant communities." ''Sociological Perspectives 43'', no. 2 (2000): 189-209.&lt;/ref&gt; or other essential reciprocal social or economic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fordham, Signithia. "Racelessness as a factor in Black students' school success: Pragmatic strategy or pyrrhic victory?." ''Harvard educational review 58'', no. 1 (1988): 54-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of chosen kin include [[godparents]], informally adopted children, and close family friends.&lt;ref name=Ciabattari&gt;Ciabattari, Teresa.

== Examples ==
Types of relations often described by anthropologists as ''fictive kinship'' include [[compadrazgo]] relations, [[foster care]], common membership in a unilineal descent group, and legal [[adoption]]. A noted [[Gurung]] tradition is the institution of "Rodi", where teenagers form fictive kinship bonds and become Rodi members to socialize, perform communal tasks, and find marriage partners. In [[Western culture]], a person may refer to close friends of one's parents as "aunt" or "uncle" (and their children as "cousin"), or may refer to close friends as "brother" or "sister", although this is just a mere courtesy treatment and does not represent an actual valuation as such. In particular, college fraternities and sororities in some North American cultures usually use "brother" and "sister" to refer to members of the organization. Monastic, Masonic, and Lodge organisations also use the term "Brother" for members. "Nursing Sister" is used to denote a rank of nurse, and the term "Sisterhood" may be used for feminists. Fictive kinship was discussed by Jenny White in her work on female migrant workers in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Money Makes Us Relatives''.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, she draws on ideas of production and the women she works with being drawn together through "webs of indebtedness" through which the women refer to each other as kin. These relationships are, however, less frequent than kin relationships, and serve purposes that are not comparable to, nor exclude, a natural [[family]] and, much less, natural and universal parents-having-children reproduction system.

* Compadrazgo is a form of fictive kinship that is rooted in Central Mexico history for many years. Literally meaning "co-parenthood", compadrazgo is a term to describe the set of relationships between a child, their parents, and their godparents. It has been hypothesized that these relationships evolved after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest in 1521]] to help deal with stressful situations.&lt;ref&gt;Horstman, Compadrazgo and Adaptation in Sixteenth Century Central Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; These fictive kinships still exist in modern day Mexican societies, and are established by providing some form of aid throughout the child's life.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos, Fictive Kinship and Modernization in Mexico: A Comparative Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Godparents seldom become more important than parents, though, much less in a non-economic fashion.
* Undocumented immigrants have also demonstrated fictive kin relationships. Undocumented restaurant workers are known to form pseudo-families in which they cooperate within living and working situations.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, "Mama's Family": Fictive Kinship and undocumented immigrant restaurant workers.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships benefit the workers by creating a support system that would otherwise be unavailable to those living far from home. These ties are, however, fictive in a strict sense and mean nothing to the people in such pretenses.
* Some fictive kin relationships have been discovered in [[Israel]] in relation to [[Organ transplantation|organ transplants]]. Hospital committees are formed to assess whether the organ donation is from a true family member or from a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Unknotting fictive kinship and legal process.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain organ transplants, some individuals are forced to find strangers and pay them compensation for the procedure. However, the relationship between the donor and recipient must be invented as a familial relationship in order to pass through the hospital committee. In this case, fictive kinship is created knowingly to both parties in order to achieve their goals, and is mutualistic in nature.
* Adoption and foster care have always been grouped into the fictive kinship category (in cases where the child shares no genetic relatedness to the caregivers). The children are normally treated as the adopters' biological kin, receiving a lot of parental investment despite not having family ties. This view has been chastised by some who claim that notions of kinship are not always based on biological determinants.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Adoption of the Unrelated Child: Some Challenges to the Anthropological Study of Kinship&lt;/ref&gt; But these links do not mean that the adopters would not love more their biological offspring, given the extra natural motivation of survival.
* The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has also been an avenue to propagate fictive kinship, such as the sense of brotherhood felt by the soldiers. Fictive kinship has been demonstrated among the spouses of military men and women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Frese, Anthropology and the United States military: Coming of Age in the Twenty First Century.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships may facilitate close bonds that are beneficial during times of hardship.
* Other times, relationships can appear from the outside to be fictive kinship relationships, but the reality is that this appearance is just the result of kinship terminology. Members of the Shanti Nagar village in [[North India]] refer to everyone—even strangers—in familial terms.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, Fictive Kinship in a North Indian Village&lt;/ref&gt; A man would address another man of a similar in age as "brother", and would address an older man as "uncle". Although these terms used in addressing one another appear to be indicative of fictive kinship, they do not actually suggest the existence of ritual kin relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Vatuk, Reference, Address, and Fictive Kinship in Urban North India.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Recently, many anthropologists have abandoned a distinction between "real" and "fictive" kin, because many cultures do not base their notion of kinship on genealogical relations. This was argued most forcefully by [[David M. Schneider]], in his 1984 book ''A critique of the study of kinship''.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, ''A Critique of The Study of Kinship''&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this insight, [[Janet Carsten]] developed the idea of "[[relatedness]]". She developed her initial ideas from studies with the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in looking at what was socialized and biological. Here she uses the idea of relatedness to move away from a pre-constructed analytics opposition which exists in anthropological thought between the biological and the social.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''The substance of kinship and the heat of the hearth; feeding, personhood and relatedness among the Malays in Pulau Langkawi''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carsten argued that relatedness should be described in terms of indigenous statements and practices, some of which fall outside what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''Cultures of Relatedness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply, however, that human non-kin relationships, such as in [[tit-for-tat]] situations, even within a friendship relation, are more important than kin relationships, since their motivation is also related to one's survival and perpetuation, or that people are necessarily bound to the culture they are inserted in, nor can it be generalized to the point of claiming all individuals always undervalue kinship in the absence of nurturing. [[Herbert Gintis]], in his review of the book ''[[Sex at Dawn]]'', critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage, "which would make us unlike any other species I can think of".&lt;ref name=gintis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gintis|first1=Herbert|title=Much that is True, but Remember: Is does not Imply Ought,|url=http://smile.amazon.com/review/RKVMPRH1FYL2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0061707805&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books#wasThisHelpful|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals can be considered out of the natural tendency of living beings for survival through offspring.

In response to a similar model advanced by [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Rice University]]’s [[David Queller]] said that such new model "involves, and I suspect requires, close kinship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Brandon Keim|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/2/|title=E.O. Wilson proposes new theory of social evolution|date=2010-08-26|website=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also overlooks phenomena of survivalist non-kin or not close kin such as the one that can be seen on [[tribalism]] or [[ethnic nationalism]].

== Use in sociobiology ==
{{see also| Social bonding and nurture kinship}}

In the biological and animal behavioural sciences, the term "kinship" has a different meaning from the current anthropological usage of the term, and more in common with the former anthropological usage that assumed that blood ties are ontologically prior to social ties. In these sciences, "kinship" is commonly used as a shorthand for "the regression coefficient of (genetic) relatedness", which is a metric denoting the proportion of shared genetic material between any two individuals relative to average degrees of genetic variance in the population under study. This coefficient of relationship is an important component of the theory of [[inclusive fitness]], a treatment of the evolutionary selective pressures on the emergence of certain forms of social behavior. Confusingly, inclusive fitness theory is more popularly known through its narrower form, [[kin selection]] theory, whose name clearly resonates with former conceptions of "kinship" in anthropology.

Whilst inclusive fitness theory thus describes one of the necessary conditions for the evolutionary emergence of social behaviors, the details of the proximate conditions mediating the expression of social bonding and cooperation have been less investigated in sociobiology. In particular, the question of whether genetic relatedness (or "blood ties") must necessarily be present for social bonding and cooperation to be expressed has been the source of much confusion, partly due to thought experiments in [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s early theoretical treatments. In addition to setting out the details of the evolutionary selection pressure, Hamilton roughly outlined two possible mechanisms by which the expression of social behaviors might be mediated:

{{quote
 | The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;
}}

Traditional sociobiology did not consider the divergent consequences between these basic possibilities for the expression of social behavior, and instead assumed that the expression operates in the "recognition" manner, whereby individuals are behaviorally primed to discriminate which others are their true genetic relatives, and engage in cooperative behavior with them. But when expression has evolved to be primarily location-based or context-based—depending on a society's particular demographics and history—social ties and cooperation may or may not coincide with blood ties. Reviews&lt;ref name="SBNK"/&gt; of the mammal, primate, and human evidence demonstrate that expression of social behaviors in these species are primarily location-based and context-based (see [[nurture kinship]]), and examples of what used to be labeled as "fictive kinship" are readily understood in this perspective. Social cooperation, however, does not mean people see each other as family or family-like, nor that people will value those known not to be related with them more than the ones who are or simply neglect relatedness.

A '''fuzzy associative matrix''' expresses [[fuzzy logic]] rules in tabular form. These rules usually take two variables as input, mapping cleanly to a two-dimensional matrix, although theoretically a matrix of any number of dimensions is possible.

Suppose a professional is tasked with writing fuzzy logic rules for a video game monster. In the game being built, entities have two variables: hit points (HP) and firepower (FP):

{|border=1
! HP/FP !! Very low HP !! Low HP !! Medium HP !! High HP !! Very high HP
|-
! Very weak FP
| Retreat! || Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Defend
|-
! Weak FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Defend || Attack || Attack
|-
! Medium FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! High FP
| Retreat! || Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack!
|-
! Very high FP
| Defend || Attack || Attack || Full attack! || Full attack!
|}

This translates to:

 IF MonsterHP IS VeryLowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS LowHP AND MonsterFP IS VeryWeakFP THEN Retreat
 IF MonsterHP IS MediumHP AND MonsterFP is VeryWeakFP THEN Defend

Multiple rules can fire at once, and often will, because the distinction between "very low" and "low" is fuzzy. If it is more "very low" than it is low, then the "very low" rule will generate a stronger response. The program will evaluate all the rules that fire and use an appropriate [[defuzzification]] method to generate its actual response.

An implementation of this system might use either the matrix or the explicit IF/THEN form. The matrix makes it easy to visualize the system, but it also makes it impossible to add a third variable just for one rule, so it is less flexible.

There is no inherent pattern in the matrix. It appears as if the rules were just made up, and indeed they were. This is both a strength and a weakness of fuzzy logic in general. It is often impractical or impossible to find an exact set of rules or formulae for dealing with a specific situation. For a sufficiently complex game, a mathematician would not be able to study the system and figure out a mathematically accurate set of rules. However, this weakness is intrinsic to the realities of the situation, not of fuzzy logic itself. The strength of the system is that even if one of the rules is wrong, even greatly wrong, other rules that are correct are likely to fire as well and they may compensate for the error.

This does not mean a fuzzy system should be sloppy. Depending on the system, it might get away with being sloppy, but it will underperform. While the rules are fairly arbitrary, they should be chosen carefully. If possible, an expert should decide on the rules, and the sets and rules should be tested vigorously and refined as needed. In this way, a fuzzy system is like an [[expert system]]. (Fuzzy logic is used in many true expert systems, as well.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous European Union" excluding member states such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The villages of '''Großwilsdorf''' and the Rödel Plateau are situated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the middle of [[Germany]].  It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts (Deutsch-Slawische Forschungen zur Namenkunde und Siedlungsgeschichte 26).|date=1971|publisher=Berlin|language=German|trans-title=The history of names in the settlement in the area of the Saale and the Elbeuntil the end of the 9th century (German-Slav research on the history of names and settlements 26).|author=Walter, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

[[File:Sandstone,_Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Hamburg Metropolitan Region as a centre of aviation ==

Companies based in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region include the aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]] and [[Lufthansa Technik]], a market leader in the field of maintenance, repair, and overhaul of civil aircraft.&lt;ref name="rüther"&gt;Rüther, Kirstin: ''Luftfahrtstandort HAM – Tradition und Vision'' in ''Internationales Verkehrswesen'' vol. 63, March 2011, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berichte.lufthansa.com/2008/gb/serviceseiten/downloads/files/gesamt_dlh_gb08.pdf |title=Geschäftsbericht 2008 |author=Frank Hülsmann |publisher=Deutsche Lufthansa AG |pages=94 |access-date=2013-03-04 |format=pdf; 4,0&amp;nbsp;MB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214224451/http://berichte.lufthansa.com/2008/gb/serviceseiten/downloads/files/gesamt_dlh_gb08.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-14 |df= }}

Four of Hamburg’s universities offer a course of study with significant aviation-related components: 
* the [[Hamburg University of Applied Sciences]] (HAW Hamburg)
* the [[Helmut Schmidt University]] / University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg
* the [[Hamburg University of Technology]] (TUHH)
* and the [[University of Hamburg]]
Also based in Hamburg are the [[German Aerospace Center]]’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine and Institute of Air Transportation Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10257/311_read-222/ |title=Der Standort Hamburg des DLR |publisher=Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

=== The focus on cabins: Crystal Cabin Award and Aircraft Interiors Expo {{anchor|Aircraft Interiors Expo}}===

A particular focus for many aviation companies in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region is the interior fittings of aircraft along with the design of aircraft cabins. Airbus develops and builds the cabins for the A380 at [[Finkenwerder Airport]], and Lufthansa Technik AG designs [[in-flight entertainment]] systems along with luxury VIP fittings for private aircraft.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |title=Wo die inneren Werte zählen – Hamburgs Kabinenkompetenz |publisher=Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V. |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319210813/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in cabin design, cabin fittings, cabin technology and In-Flight Entertainment and Communications (IFE&amp;amp;C).
The aviation region’s focus on this field is clearly seen in the Aircraft Interiors Expo, an annual specialist trade fair held in Hamburg since 2002. Launched in 2007, the [[Crystal Cabin Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |title=General Information |publisher=Crystal Cabin Award Association |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106210825/http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for outstanding product innovations in the field of aircraft interior fittings is presented as part of this trade fair.&lt;ref&gt;Munke, Hans-Jörg: Weltweit führende Fachmesse, Artikel in: Hamburger Abendblatt, 21. März 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is funded by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.

== The aerospace cluster: Hamburg Aviation ==

In the field of [[economics]], an accumulation of companies spread throughout the value creation chain, interwoven with research and training facilities, such as exists in the aviation industry in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, is termed a [[Business cluster]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E.: Clusters and the New Economics of Competition; Harvard Business Review: 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A cluster is defined by a triple helix structure: the interplay between commerce, research and education, and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry: The Triple Helix. University-Industry-Government Innovation in Action, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, companies, universities and government bodies joined forces to establish the “Hamburg Aviation Initiative” in order to promote the development of the aviation industry cluster in Hamburg. This developed into the “Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V.” association, with 15 founding members, formally established in 2011. Hamburg Aviation is the brand name of this association. Its goal is the joint coordination of initiatives to support the aviation industry in the region.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Strategie und Erfolge des Spitzenclusters |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620134414/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |archivedate=2013-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of its work include the initiation of cooperative research projects and the management of EU research projects along with regular industry gatherings such as the Hamburg Aviation Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Das Hamburg Aviation Forum |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802042757/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |archivedate=2013-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation of events designed to secure the next generation of aviation specialists.

=== Winning the Leading-Edge Cluster competition ===

In 2008, the then Hamburg Aviation Initiative was recognised as a Leading-Edge Cluster in the first Leading-Edge Cluster Competition organised by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF).&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, Bob: [http://www.abendblatt.de/wirtschaft/article559622/Bund-staerkt-Hamburger-Luftfahrtbranche.html ''Bund stärkt Hamburger Luftfahrtbranche''] Article in Hamburger Abendblatt, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a total of 40 million euros of public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/regional/hamburg/forschung/euro-fuer-hamburgs-luftfahrt-forschung-5684244.bild.html ''Hamburg Luftfahrt-Forschung: Bund gibt 40 Millionen Euro'']. Article in Bild, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This partial funding, combined with the support of companies in the cluster, financed numerous research and development projects.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation" /&gt; The total investment in research and development as a result of winning the competition was over 80 million euros.&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aerobrief"&gt;''Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e. V. mit neuem Vorstand zu neuen Horizonten'' in ''Aerobrief 25/2011'' 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network projects: ZAL and HCAT ===

In 2009, as a network project of the universities, aviation enterprises, industry associations, research institutions and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the Center of Applied Aeronautical Research (Zentrum für Angewandte Luftfahrtforschung, or ZAL) was established – an initiative of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''Hamburg hothouse for cabin technology to open in 2013'' in ''APEXnews'' 15 March 2011, Airline Passenger Experience Association, London, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative campus of the Hamburg Centre of Aviation Training (HCAT), is one project focussed on the training of qualified specialist personnel, securing the next generation of aviation specialists.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII"&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''hamburg hothouse'' in ''Aircraft Interiors International'' June 2011, pp.66-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schütte, Gisela: [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/hamburg/article13877009/Ein-Flugzeug-als-schwieriges-Puzzlespiel.html ''Ein Flugzeug als schwieriges Puzzlespiel. Studenten lernen im HCAT, wie Kabinen und Cockpits optimal gestaltet werden''].Online at: Die Welt, 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamburg Aviation: the next generation ===

Securing the next generation of qualified personnel is a significant focus of the work of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Nachwuchsförderung und Qualifizierung |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723190931/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous projects, jointly supported by the industry, the city and the universities, serve this purpose. Examples include the Faszination Technik Klub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faszination-fuer-technik.de/startseite.html |title=Faszination Technik Klub für Kinder &amp; Jugendliche in Hamburg |publisher=Faszination-fuer-technik.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; organising lectures and events related to aviation for children and teenagers, and the [[DLR School Lab]] at the Hamburg University of Technology, where school pupils can carry out technical and scientific experiments.

=== International cooperative programs ===

Another area in which the association is active is the promotion of international cooperation between aviation locations. In May 2009, Hamburg Aviation launched the [[European Aerospace Cluster Partnership]] (EACP).&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Weltweite Kooperationen |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723194553/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the organisation is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and to initiate cooperative projects across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eacp-aero.eu |title=EACP: European Aerospace Cluster Partnership |language=de |publisher=Eacp-aero.eu |date=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such project is CARE: Clean Aerospace Regions, funded by the European Commission. The project provides a framework for 10 partners, 8 of them EACP members, to collaborate in promoting research into ecologically efficient technologies and processes for the air transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://care-aero.eu |title=CARE Aero: CARE Aero |publisher=Care-aero.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829020312/http://care-aero.eu/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human height''' or '''stature''' is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a [[human body]], standing erect. It is measured using a [[stadiometer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadiometers and Height Measurement Devices|url=https://www.stadiometer.com/|website=stadiometer.com|publisher=stadiometer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in centimetres when using the [[metric system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the BMI-for-Age Growth Charts |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |website=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Center for Disease Control]] |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130012800/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |archivedate=30 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Price, Beth|title=MathsWorld Year 8 VELS Edition|date=2009|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]]|location=Australia|page=626|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2veDRPjMggC&amp;printsec=frontcover|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or feet and inches when using the [[imperial system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lapham, Robert  |author2=Agar, Heather |title=Drug Calculations for Nurses|date=2009|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=USA|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1_vAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Pamela J.|title=Lippincott's Textbook for Nursing Assistants: A Humanistic Approach to Caregiving|date=2008|publisher=[[Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=USA|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=biM2u4JfxZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular genetic profile in men called [[Haplogroup I-M170|Y haplotype I-M170]] is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with height. Ecological data shows that as the frequency of this genetic profile increases in the population, the average male height in a country also increases.

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to [[gigantism]] or [[dwarfism]], which are medical conditions caused by specific [[gene]]s or [[endocrine]] abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, William F. (2001) ''Review of Medical Physiology'', Lange Medical, pp. 392–397, {{ISBN|0071605673}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions. Some research indicates that a greater height correlates with greater success in dating and earning in men, although other research indicates that this does not apply to non-white men.&lt;ref&gt;https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-problem-with-being-tall-male-and-black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of growth and height==
[[Image:Human height growth per month, United States.png|thumb|right|300px|The median (50th percentile) growth curves for male and females 0–20 years in the United States.]]
The study of height is known as [[auxology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermanussen, Michael (ed) (2013) ''Auxology – Studying Human Growth and Development'', Schweizerbart, {{ISBN|9783510652785}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the [[health]] of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential in regard to differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness ([[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]]) of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolton-Smith | first1 = C. | title = Accuracy of the estimated prevalence of obesity from self reported height and weight in an adult Scottish population | doi = 10.1136/jech.54.2.143 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–148 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1731630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper [[Health care|medical care]] and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed.&lt;ref name=kolmos2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Komlos | first1 = J. | last2 = Baur | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2003.12.006 | title = From the tallest to (one of) the fattest: The enigmatic fate of the American population in the 20th century | journal = Economics &amp; Human Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 57–74 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15463993| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average (male) height in a nation is correlated with [[protein quality]].

Changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations.

Height measurements are by nature subject to statistical sampling errors even for a single individual.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} In a clinical situation, height measurements are seldom taken more often than once per office visit, which may mean sampling taking place a week to several months apart. The smooth 50th percentile male and female growth curves illustrated above are aggregate values from thousands of individuals sampled at ages from birth to age 20. In reality, a single individual's growth curve shows large upward and downward spikes, partly due to actual differences in growth velocity, and partly due to small measurement errors.

For example, a typical measurement error of plus or minus 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm may completely nullify 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm of actual growth resulting in either a "negative" 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (due to overestimation in the previous visit combined with underestimation in the latter), up to a 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (the first visit underestimating and the second visit overestimating) in the same elapsed time period between measurements. Note there is a discontinuity in the growth curves at age 2, which reflects the difference in recumbent length (with the child on his or her back), used in measuring infants and toddlers and standing height typically measured from age 2 onwards.

[[Image:Galton-height-regress.jpg|thumb|300px|Sir [[Francis Galton]]'s (1889) data showing the relationship between offspring height (928 individuals) as a function of mean parent height (205 sets of parents). The [[correlation]] was 0.57.]]
Height, like other [[phenotypic]] traits, is determined by a combination of [[genetics]] and [[environmental factor]]s. A child's height based on parental heights is subject to [[regression toward the mean]], therefore extremely tall or short parents will likely have correspondingly taller or shorter offspring, but their offspring will also likely be closer to average height than the parents themselves. Genetic potential and a number of hormones, minus illness, is a basic determinant for height. Other factors include the genetic response to external factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and life circumstances.

Humans grow fastest (other than in the womb) as [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s, rapidly declining from a maximum at birth to roughly age 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate, and then during the [[pubertal]] growth spurt, a rapid rise to a second maximum (at around 11–12 years for female, and 13–14 years for male), followed by a steady decline to zero. On average, female growth speed trails off to zero at about 15 or 16 years, whereas the male curve continues for approximately 3 more years, going to zero at about 18–19. These are also critical periods where stressors such as malnutrition (or even severe [[child neglect]]) have the greatest effect.

Moreover, the health of a mother throughout her life, especially during her critical period and [[pregnancy]], has a role. A healthier child and adult develops a body that is better able to provide optimal prenatal conditions.&lt;ref name="grantham2007" /&gt; The pregnant mother's health is important for herself but also for the fetus as [[gestation]] is itself a critical period for an [[embryo]]/[[fetus]], though some problems affecting height during this period are resolved by catch-up growth assuming childhood conditions are good. Thus, there is a cumulative generation effect such that nutrition and health over generations influences the height of descendants to varying degrees.

The age of the mother also has some influence on her child's height. Studies in modern times have observed a gradual increase in height with maternal age, though these early studies suggest that trend is due to various socio-economic situations that select certain demographics as being more likely to have a first birth early in the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n1/fig_tab/1601508t1.html#figure-title Table 1.

=== Nature versus nurture ===
The precise relationship between [[nature versus nurture|genetics and environment]] is complex and uncertain. Differences in human height is 60–80% [[Heritability|heritable]], according to several [[twin study|twin studies]]&lt;ref name=weedon&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/|title=How much of human height is genetic and how much is due to nutrition? |author=Lai, Chao-Qiang |journal=Scientific American|date=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been considered [[polygenic]] since the [[Mendelian-biometrician debate]] a hundred years ago.

The effect of environment on height is illustrated by studies performed by anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] and coworkers of Guatemala Mayan children living in the United States. In the early 1970s, when Bogin first visited [[Guatemala]], he observed that [[Mayan Indian]] men averaged only {{convert|157.5|cm|ftin|frac=2}} in height and the women averaged {{convert|142.2|cm|ftin|frac=2}}. Bogin took another series of measurements after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], during which up to a million Guatemalans fled to the United States. He discovered that Maya refugees, who ranged from six to twelve years old, were significantly taller than their Guatemalan counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 40–44 | last = Bogin | first = Barry | title = The tall and the short of it | journal = Discover | accessdate = 26 April 2013 | year = 1998 | url = http://courses.washington.edu/bioa101/articles/article38.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the American Maya were {{convert|10.24|cm|in|abbr=on}} taller than the Guatemalan Maya of the same age, largely due to better nutrition and [[health care]].&lt;ref name="bogin2003" /&gt; Bogin also noted that American Maya children had relatively longer legs, averaging {{convert|7.02|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than the Guatemalan Maya (a significantly lower sitting height ratio).&lt;ref name=bogin2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Rios | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5 | title = Rapid morphological change in living humans: Implications for modern human origins | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 136 | pages = 71–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  14527631| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krawitz, Jan |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_heightgap_04.html |title=P.O.V. – Big Enough |publisher=PBS |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of growth==
{{See also|Adolescence#Growth spurt}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Endocrine growth regulation.svg|thumb|The main pathways in the endocrine regulation of growth]]

Growth in stature, determined by its various factors, results from the lengthening of bones via cellular divisions chiefly regulated by [[somatotropin]] (human [[growth hormone]] (hGH)) secreted by the anterior [[pituitary]] gland. Somatotropin also stimulates the release of another growth inducing hormone [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) mainly by the liver. Both hormones operate on most tissues of the body, have many other functions, and continue to be secreted throughout life; with peak levels coinciding with peak growth velocity, and gradually subsiding with age after [[adolescence]]. The bulk of secretion occurs in bursts (especially for adolescents) with the largest during sleep.

The majority of linear growth occurs as growth of cartilage at the [[epiphysis]] (ends) of the [[long bone]]s which gradually [[Endochondral ossification|ossify]] to form hard bone. The legs compose approximately half of adult human height, and leg length is a somewhat [[sexually dimorphic]] trait, with men having proportionately longer legs. Some of this growth occurs after the growth spurt of the long bones has ceased or slowed. The majority of growth during growth spurts is of the long bones. Additionally, the variation in height between populations and across time is largely due to changes in leg length. The remainder of height consists of the cranium. Height is sexually dimorphic and statistically it is more or less [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], but with [[heavy tail]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 
It has been shown that a [[log-normal distribution]] fits the data equally well, besides guaranteeing a non-negative lower [[confidence limit]], which could otherwise attain a non-physical negative height value for arbitrarily large confidence levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Limpert |first1=E |last2=Stahel |first2=W |last3=Abbt |first3=M |title=Lognormal distributions across the sciences: keys and clues |journal=BioScience |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=341–352 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0341:LNDATS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height abnormalities==

Most intra-population variance of height is genetic. [[Short stature]] and tall stature are usually not a health concern. If the degree of deviation from normal is significant, hereditary short stature is known as familial short stature and tall stature is known as familial tall stature. Confirmation that exceptional height is normal for a respective person can be ascertained from comparing stature of family members and analyzing growth trends for abrupt changes, among others. There are, however, various diseases and disorders that cause growth abnormalities.

Most notably, extreme height may be pathological, such as [[gigantism]] resulting from childhood hyperpituitarism, and [[dwarfism]] which has various causes. Rarely, no cause can be found for extreme height; very short persons may be termed as having [[idiopathic short stature]]. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003 approved hGH treatment for those 2.25 standard deviations below the population mean (approximately the lowest 1.2% of the population). An even rarer occurrence, or at least less used term and recognized "problem", is idiopathic tall stature.

If not enough [[growth hormone]] is produced and/or secreted by the pituitary gland, then a patient with growth hormone deficiency can undergo treatment. This treatment involves the injection of pure growth hormone into thick tissue to promote growth.

==Role of an individual's height==

===Height and health===

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain studies have shown that height is a factor in overall health while some suggest tallness is associated with better cardiovascular health and shortness with longevity.&lt;ref name="Samaras"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Samaras TT, Elrick H |title=Height, body size, and longevity: is smaller better for the humanbody? |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=206–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12016250 |pmc=1071721 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.176.3.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer risk has also been found to grow with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/07/21/height-cancer-risk.html | work=CBC News | title=Cancer risk may grow with height | date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, modern westernized interpretations of the relationship between height and health fail to account for the observed height variations worldwide.&lt;ref name=cavalli&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., &amp; Cavalli-Sforza, F., 1995, ''The Great Human Diasporas'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavalli-Sforza and Cavalli-Sforza note that variations in height worldwide can be partly attributed to evolutionary pressures resulting from differing environments. These evolutionary pressures result in height related health implications.  While tallness is an adaptive benefit in colder climates such as found in Europe, shortness helps dissipate body heat in warmer climatic regions.&lt;ref name=cavalli /&gt;  Consequently, the relationships between health and height cannot be easily generalized since tallness and shortness can both provide health benefits in different environmental settings.

At the extreme end, being excessively tall can cause various medical problems, including cardiovascular problems, because of the increased load on the heart to supply the body with blood, and problems resulting from the increased time it takes the brain to communicate with the extremities. For example, [[Robert Pershing Wadlow|Robert Wadlow]], the tallest man known to verifiable history, developed trouble walking as his height increased throughout his life. In many of the pictures of the later portion of his life, Wadlow can be seen gripping something for support. Late in his life, although he died at age 22, he had to wear braces on his legs and walk with a cane; and he died after developing an infection in his legs because he was unable to feel the irritation and cutting caused by his leg braces.

Sources are in disagreement about the overall relationship between height and longevity. Samaras and Elrick, in the Western Journal of Medicine, demonstrate an inverse correlation between height and longevity in several mammals including humans.&lt;ref name="Samaras"/&gt;

Women whose height is under {{convert|150|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} may have a small [[human pelvis|pelvis]], resulting in such complications during [[childbirth]] as [[shoulder dystocia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch258/ch258b.html|work=Merck Manual Home Edition|publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Sweden in 2005 has shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between height and suicide among Swedish men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Magnusson PK, Gunnell D, Tynelius P, Davey Smith G, Rasmussen F |title=Strong inverse association between height and suicide in a large cohort of Swedish men: evidence of early life origins of suicidal behavior? |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=7 |pages=1373–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15994722 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large body of human and animal evidence indicates that shorter, smaller bodies age slower, and have fewer chronic diseases and greater longevity. For example, a study found eight areas of support for the "smaller lives longer" thesis. These areas of evidence include studies involving longevity, life expectancy, centenarians, male vs. female longevity differences, mortality advantages of shorter people, survival findings, smaller body size due to calorie restriction, and within species body size differences. They all support the conclusion that smaller individuals live longer in healthy environments and with good nutrition. However, the difference in longevity is modest. Several human studies have found a loss of 0.5 year/centimeter of increased height (1.2 yr/inch). But these findings do not mean that all tall people die young. Many live to advanced ages and some become centenarians.&lt;ref&gt;Samaras TT 2014, Evidence from eight different types of studies showing smaller body size is related to greater longevity JSRR 3(16):2150-2160. 2014: article no. JSRR.2014.16.003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height and occupational success===
{{see also|Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States}}
There is a large body of research in psychology, economics, and [[human biology]] that has assessed the relationship between several seemingly innocuous physical features (e.g., body height) and occupational success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Body height and occupational success for actors and actresses |first=Stieger |last=Stefan |first2=Burger |last2=Christoph |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=107 |pages=25–38 |year=2010 |doi=10.2466/pr0.107.1.25-38 |pmid=20923046 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between height and success was explored decades ago.&lt;ref name="W.

In most occupational fields, body height is not relevant to how well people are able to perform; nonetheless several studies found that success was positively correlated with body height, although there may be other factors such as gender or socioeonomic status that are correlated with height which may account for the difference in success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W.

The only exceptions of this rather uniform height distribution were people in the Anglo-Saxon settlement regions who were taller than the average and people from Southeast Asia with below-average heights.

In the late nineteenth century, the Netherlands was a land renowned for its short population {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, but today its population is among the world's tallest with young men averaging {{convert|183.8|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/pr.2012.189|title=The world's tallest nation has stopped growing taller: The height of Dutch children from 1955 to 2009|year=2012|last1=Schönbeck|first1=Yvonne|last2=Talma|first2=Henk|last3=Van Dommelen|first3=Paula|last4=Bakker|first4=Boudewijn|last5=Buitendijk|first5=Simone E.|last6=Hirasing|first6=Remy A.|last7=Van Buuren|first7=Stef|journal=[[Pediatric Research]]|volume=73|issue=3|pages=371–7|pmid=23222908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by economist [[John Komlos]] and Francesco Cinnirella, in the first half of the 18th century, the average height of an English male was 165&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in), and the average height of an Irish male was 168&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in).

The tallest living man is [[Sultan Kösen]] of [[Turkey]], at {{Height|cm=251}}. The tallest man in modern history was [[Robert Pershing Wadlow]] (1918–1940), from [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], who was {{Height|cm=272}} at the time of his death. The tallest woman in medical history was [[Zeng Jinlian]] of [[Hunan]], China, who stood {{Height|cm=248}} when she died at the age of 17. The shortest adult human on record was [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] of [[Nepal]] at {{Height|cm=54.6}}.

Adult height between populations often differs significantly. For example, the average height of women from the Czech Republic is greater than that of men from Malawi. This may be caused by genetic differences, childhood lifestyle differences (nutrition, sleep patterns, physical labor), or both.

Depending on sex, genetic and environmental factors, shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be universal in the extremely aged. This decrease in height is due to such factors as decreased height of inter-vertebral discs because of [[desiccation]], [[atrophy]] of soft tissues and postural changes secondary to degenerative disease.

* A relatively small sample of the population may have been measured, which makes it uncertain whether this sample accurately represents the entire population.
* The height of persons can vary over the course of a day, due to factors such as a height increase from exercise done directly before measurement (normally inversely correlated), or a height increase since lying down for a significant period of time (normally inversely correlated). For example, one study revealed a mean decrease of {{convert|1.54|cm|in}} in the heights of 100 children from getting out of bed in the morning to between 4 and 5 p.m. that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1545095 | pmid=568918 | volume=53 | title=Variations in height throughout the day | journal=Arch Dis Child | pages=762 | last1 = Buckler | first1 = JM | doi=10.1136/adc.53.9.762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors may not have been controlled in some of the studies.

In the Netherlands, about 35% of men have the genetic profile Y [[haplogroup I-M170]], but in Herzegovina, the frequency is over 70%. Extrapolating the genetic trend line suggests that the average Herzegovinian man could possibly be as tall as 190&amp;nbsp;cm (nearly 6′ 3″). Many Herzegovinians do not achieve this potential due to poverty (citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm taller if both of their parents went to university, which is considered as a wealth indicator) and to nutritional choices: [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|religious prohibition on pork]] may be largely to blame for the shorter average stature of Muslim Herzegovinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acsh.org/news/2017/04/12/move-over-dutch-men-herzegovinians-may-be-tallest-world-11122 "Move Over, Dutch Men.

The '''Janzen–Connell hypothesis''' is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of [[tree]] [[species]] [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical rainforests]].  It was published independently in the early 1970s by [[Daniel Janzen]]&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;Janzen, Daniel H. "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests." The American Naturalist. 104.940 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Connell]].&lt;ref name="Connell"&gt;Connell, J.H. "On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive exclusion in some marine animals and in rain forest trees." In: Dynamics of Population. Ed. P.J. Den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Pudoc, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their hypothesis, [[Host (biology)|host]]-specific [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[pathogens]], or other [[natural enemies]] (often referred to as [[Predation|predators]]&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called [[specialist predator|specialists]]), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a [[coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]].

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been called a special case of [[keystone species|keystone predation]], [[niche partitioning#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]] or the pest pressure hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;Carson, Walter A. and Stefan A. Schnitzer. Tropical Forest Community Ecology. Blackwell Publishing: Hoboken, NJ, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Gregory|editor1-last=Burslem|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Pinard|editor2-first=Michelle|editor3-last=Hartley|editor3-first=Sue|title=Biotic interactions in the tropics : their role in the maintenance of species diversity|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521609852|pages=141-164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pest pressure hypothesis states that plant diversity is maintained by specialist natural enemies.&lt;ref name="gillette1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillette|first1=J.B.|title=Pest pressure, an underestimated factor in evolution|journal=Taxonomy and Geography; a symposium|date=1962|volume=4|issue=37|pages=37-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Janzen-Connell hypothesis expands on this, by claiming that the natural enemies are not only specialists, but also are distance-responsive or density-responsive.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;

This mechanism has been proposed as promoting diversity of forests as it promotes survival of a number of different plant species within one localized region. While previously thought to explain the high diversity of tropical forests in particular, subsequent research has demonstrated the applicability of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis in temperate settings as well. The Black Cherry is one such example of a [[temperate forest]] species whose growth patterns can still be explained by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.

==History==

===Daniel Janzen’s hypothesis===
Daniel Janzen published his hypothesis in 1970 in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' under the article "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests."&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; His hypothesis was based on the observation that in tropical forests (when compared to temperate forests), there were few new adult trees in the immediate vicinity of their parent tree. He explained the low density of tropical trees and lack of "bunching" of tree types around parent trees for two reasons: (1) the number of [[seeds]] decline with distance from the parent tree and (2) that the adult tree, its seeds, and seedlings are a source of food for host-specific parasites and diseases.
Using his observations, Janzen created a model demonstrating the probability of a seed maturation or a seedling survival as a function of distance from the parent tree (as well as total seed count, dispersal mechanism, and predatorial activity).

===Joseph Connell hypothesis===
Joseph Connell published his hypothesis in 1971 in Dynamics of Populations.&lt;ref name="Connell" /&gt; Unlike Janzen, Connell proposed experiments that focused on the key prediction that exclusion of host-specific predators would cause a decrease in diversity as tree species with greater establishment or competitive ability formed low-diversity seedling and sapling communities where dominance was concentrated in a few species.

He formed his hypothesis through observations in [[Queensland]], Australia.  Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended to occur in single-species clumps.  Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater [[Mortality rate|mortality]], especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual of the same species.  This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults.  To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species.  In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others.  Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent.  This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by interspecies competition.

==Effects on forest dynamics==

===Disease dynamics and tree density===
Plant pathogens follow [[infectious disease dynamics]]. The [[basic reproductive rate]] &lt;math&gt;(R_0)&lt;/math&gt; of a disease is dependent on three variables such that:

&lt;br&gt;{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;beta;''L''''S''}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Where &amp;beta; is the transmission rate or infectiousness of the disease, ''L'' is the average infection time of the host, and ''S'' is the density of the host population.  By decreasing any one of the variables, the reproduction rate of the disease decreases.  Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults.

===Herbivory and tree density===
Specialist herbivores who consume plant matter can also be thought of as having a "transmission rate" between individuals similarly to a disease. Tree predators (especially herbivorous insects) are limited by the ease of movement. When individuals are closer together at high density, movement between trees is easier and the predators quickly spread out. However, at low tree density, predators can not find the next individual with as much ease and thus often have low transmission rates leading to less specialist predation.

==Problematic aspects==

Many studies examining the Janzen–Connell hypothesis have shown supporting patterns with a number of tree species, but despite this there are also problematic aspects of the hypothesis.
# The first is that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis explains diversity at a community-wide scale, but most studies have only looked at a single species or a localized region. Most studies do not test the diversity prediction and did not determine the causes for patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  As Wright (2002) pointed out, "field measurements only demonstrate that niche differences, Janzen–Connell effects, and negative density dependence occur. Implications for species coexistence and plant diversity remain conjectural."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J.S.  "Plant diversity in tropical forests: a review of mechanisms of species coexistence."  Oecologia. 130.1 (2002): 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# While these host-specific predators may play [[keystone species]] roles as they possibly aid in the prevention of superior tree competitors from monopolizing an area, no study has yet to examine species richness and abundance after removing natural enemies, creating a gap in the supporting research for the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Diversity may be maintained, at least in part, by episodic outbreaks of specialized pests, which may reduce the survivorship, growth, and [[fecundity|reproductive success]] of adults of a species whenever they are particularly aggregated.  Thus, specialist predation also impacts adult density, rather than just juveniles which has been the focus of research efforts.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Disease and predation may be just affecting overall density rather than in localized regions around adults alone.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Theoretical work has suggested that distance-responsive predators are less able to promote coexistence than equivalent predators that are not distance-responsive.&lt;ref name="stump2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stump|first1=Simon Maccracken|last2=Chesson|first2=Peter|title=Distance-responsive predation is not necessary for the Janzen–Connell hypothesis|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2015|volume=106|pages=60–70|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2015.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Many empirical studies have shown that few natural enemies are host-specific specialists,&lt;ref name="novotny2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=V.|last2=Basset|first2=Y.|title=Host specificity of insect herbivores in tropical forests|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2005|volume=272|issue=1568|pages=1083–1090|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3023|pmc=1559807}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the original hypothesis claimed.  However, theoretical work has suggested that predators can have broader diets as long as they are more damaging to their primary host than other species.&lt;ref name="sedio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedio|first1=Brian E.|last2=Ostling|first2=Annette M.|last3=Ris Lambers|first3=Janneke Hille|title=How specialised must natural enemies be to facilitate coexistence among plants?|journal=Ecology Letters|date=August 2013|volume=16|issue=8|pages=995–1003|doi=10.1111/ele.12130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The responses of density-dependent predators' may not be restricted to a single trophic level, and when multiple trophic levels interact, Janzen-Connell effects may be negated. This is an example of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"  and it has been shown that the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations can be severely limited when the natural enemies of the seed predators are also density responsive &lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Muller-Landau|first2=Helene C.|last3=Wright|first3=S. Joseph|last4=Rutten|first4=Gemma|last5=Jansen|first5=Patrick A.|title=Tri-trophic interactions affect density dependence of seed fate in a tropical forest palm|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=14|issue=11|year=2011|pages=1093–1100|issn=1461023X|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Research testing the hypothesis==

===Supporting research===
There have been over 50 studies designed to test predictions of this hypothesis in tropical and other settings and most show that many tree species exhibit patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.  Studies that have supported the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* A 2010 study of [[Panama]] forest reinforced that Janzen–Connell effects are also prevalent in tropical rainforests as seedlings growing close to their parents are likely to die due to [[microorganisms]] in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, Scott A., et al. "Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest." Nature 466 (8 July 2010) 752–755.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 study by Petermann ''et al.'' in [[grasslands]] showed that soil-borne pests created a feedback very similar to the Janzen–Connell effect, supporting the hypothesis as a driver of diversity in temperate [[ecosystems]]. This study suggests that the predator/density mechanism that promotes species diversity is not contained to tropical forests alone – even if tropical ecosystems do have the highest diversity. This supports the hypothesis as a mechanism for diversity, but not as an explanation [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pertermann, Jana S. et al. "Janzen–Connell Effects are Widespread and Strong Enough to Maintain Diversity in Grasslands." Ecology 89.9 (2008): 2399–2406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An examination of spatial data for 24 woody tropical rain forest plants showed either density-dependence or distance-dependence in plant offspring, supporting the hypothesis. However, other causal factors such as [[allelopathy]] were also suggested in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Deborah A. and David B. Clark. "Dynamics of a Tropical Rain Forest Tree: Evaluation of the Janzen–Connell Model." The American Naturalist. 124.6 (1984):769–788.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Research===
Studies questioning the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* Hyatt ''et al.'' examined the hypothesis across a number of tree species (rather than focusing on the effects on just one) and found no support for the distance-dependence of the hypothesis and concluded that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis was not a mechanism for diversity. They did find however that in temperate settings, distance from parent reduced survivorship. But in tropical settings there was a slight positive correlation between the improved competitive ability of seeds and  distance from parent.&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;Hyatt, Lauren A. et al. "The Distance Dependence Prediction of the Janzen–Connell Hypothesis: a Meta-Analysis." Oikos. 103.3 (2003): 590–602.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings were later challenged: Using additional data, and slightly different statistical techniques, Comita ''et al.''&lt;ref name="comita_2014_meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Comita|first1=Liza S.|last2=Queenborough|first2=Simon A.|last3=Murphy|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Eck|first4=Jenalle L.|last5=Xu|first5=Kaiyang|last6=Krishnadas|first6=Meghna|last7=Beckman|first7=Noelle|last8=Zhu|first8=Yan|last9=Gómez-Aparicio|first9=Lorena|title=Testing predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis of experimental evidence for distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling survival|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 2014|volume=102|issue=4|pages=845–856|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12232|pmc=4140603}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there was strong evidence for distance-dependence at the seedling stage, but not at the seed stage.
* A 1994 study by Burkey found that seed predation did not follow a pattern supporting that of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis along a meaningful scale. Seeds within 1 metre from the trunk were highly predated. However, seeds reached their peak density while still under the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of their parent. The authors concluded that seed predation did not follow the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Burkey, T.V. "Tree Species Diversity: A Test of the Janzen–Connell Model." Oecologia. 97. (1994): 533–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current conclusions and further research==
It is tricky to form conclusions regarding the accuracy of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis as it is difficult to falsify. This is because:
* Heavy predation may keep some species rare and widely spaced, and these species may also be the best competitors.  If so, these species are most likely to form dense aggregations that would reduce diversity in local areas. But due to their rarity or a belief that rare species are not regulated by density-dependence, these species may be the ones least likely to be studied.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
* This means that the failure to find Janzen–Connell effects for what could be hundreds of tree species does not reject the hypothesis, as ecologists are missing the few key species where it does apply. However, dissenting findings do reduce the importance of the hypothesis for explaining overall coexistence of a number species.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
** For example, Hyatt ''et al.'' (2003) found that there were "individual cases of conformity to the hypothesis,"&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt; which is all that is needed for the hypothesis to work if the specific cases represent tree species that are excellent competitors, highly shade tolerant, habitat generalists, or some combination of these traits that would allow these species to otherwise dominate the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;

It is likely that a number of mechanisms underscore the coexistence of similar species and thus cause biodiversity in ecosystems. It is possible the Janzen–Connell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics. The hypothesis may also be affected by the kind of predator or pathogen as preliminary research has shown that the hypothesis is true only when host-specific predators have limited mobility with a range less than the seed dispersal range.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Ran and Renato Casagrandi. "A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen–Connell and beyond." Journal of Ecology. 92. (2004): 733–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[financial crisis]], [[regulation]] of financial activities is at the center of economic and political events. The crisis has indeed led regulators but also the academic world to ask new questions about the effectiveness of regulation policies. To answer these questions, the French '''laboratory of excellence on financial regulation''' (Labex ReFi) was established at the initiative of the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (CNAM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enass.fr/recherche/laboratoire_d_excellence/laboratoire-d-excellence-fr-1-r67.html|title=Ecole nationale d'assurances – Laboratoire d'excellence|website=www.enass.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA) and [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] and [[ESCP Europe]] (project leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escpeurope.eu/fr/faculte-recherche/centres-de-recherche-laboratoires-de-recherche-escp-europe-business-school/labex-refi-laboratoire-dexcellence-regulation-financiere-escp-europe/|title=Labex Réfi Laboratoire d'Excellence Régulation Financière – ESCP Europe|website=www.escpeurope.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the framework of the “Grand Emprunt”. Financed over 10 years, Labex ReFi will be evaluated by the National Research Agency (ANR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labex-refi.com/|title=Labex Refi -|website=www.labex-refi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labex ReFi : a laboratory of excellence helping the financial regulation ==

Governance LABEX ReFi is organized around a Scientific Council under the leadership of Prof. [[Christian de Boissieu]], a Strategic Orientation Committee, chaired by Mr. [[Augustin de Romanet de Beaune]], composed of regulators and professionals, as well as academic personalities and an Executive Committee, led by Dr. [[Raphael Douady]] and Mr. François-Gilles Le Theule, with representation from each partner institution.

Labex ReFi is a research center dedicated to the evaluation of regulatory policies. It aims both to advance knowledge of the functioning of financial systems and their regulation, and secondly, to "advise" and "guide" the independent action of public authorities in the implementation of policies regulation by providing academic expertise.&lt;ref&gt;http://riskergy.com/rd/members/labex-refi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Labex ReFi is a multidisciplinary laboratory where specialists in economics, accounting, [[finance]] and management, financial mathematics and law, from several institutions, collaborate. All these disciplines are concerned with financial regulation but from different angles, with tools, language, incentives and evaluation systems of their own. One objective of the Labex ReFi is to bring together researchers from various backgrounds to produce this set of "useful" research for the implementation of regulatory policies. This is an important issue because regulation has often been characterized by "silo" logic. Each discipline works separately and develops its own doctrine, without fully understanding questions raised by the interaction with other disciplines, which sometimes leads to erroneous visions and consequently unwelcome decisions or with consequences opposite to the effect sought after.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.gouv.fr/files/live/sites/anc/files/contributed/Articles%20et%20discours/2011/2011_11_17_Discours_LABEX.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missions ==
Labex ReFi activities articulate around three areas: research, valorization and education.

=== Research Projects ===
The research is organized into working groups driven by academic professors or researchers from partner institutions. Labex researchers are interested in major issues of financial regulation, such as asset allocation and evaluation, market (in)efficiency, history of financial crises, interaction with the economy real, financial information, credit rating agencies, banking and insurance regulation, regulating financial activities and capital markets, systemic risk, the valuation of long-term assets, etc. Calls for projects are launched every year since 2012. Doctoral fellowships and postdoctoral contracts are also awarded each year. Partner institutions (University of Paris I, ESCP Europe, CNAM, ENA, ENASS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recherche.cnam.fr/le-cnam-dans-les-labex-d-hesam-universite-607193.kjsp|title=Les labex et projets de recherche heSam Université|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also animate research seminars dedicated to the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larsg.over-blog.com/article-le-labex-refi-escp-europe-paris-i-cnam-ena-re-oit-le-cercle-turgot-a-la-sorbonne-116511469.html|title=Le Labex RéFi (ESCP Europe, Paris I, CNAM, ENA) reçoit le Cercle Turgot à la Sorbonne – La Revue des Sciences de Gestion – Direction et Gestion des Entreprises|first=La redaction de|last=LaRSG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy Papers Valuation ===
Valorization primarily happens through "[[White paper|policy papers]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaelgiraud.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/renationaliser-la-dette-policy-paper-REFI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with current regulatory topics and express academic views on these matters. Different types of events are organized, including breakfasts every two months putting together professionals, regulators and academics to discuss various topics. Since November 2011, breakfasts addressed questions related to assessing sovereign debts, the role of rating agencies and the separation of banking activities, market efficiency, the asset quality review, the content of risk reports, etc. Several conferences for large audiences were organized on main regulation themes including a major conference in June 2013 in collaboration with FEBS on "Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk", which brought together over 350 participants, as well as other events, e.g. "Rethinking the finance standards" (October 2011), "Shareholder activism" (January 2012), "4th edition of the European Days of control" (February 2012), "The new prudential standards: what effects banking sector, what effects on financial stability?" (March 2012), etc. Senior researchers from Labex ReFi author a monthly column in Revue Banque on topical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revue-banque.fr/recherche/results/labex+r%C3%A9fi|title=Recherche : labex, réfi – Revue Banque|website=www.revue-banque.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collective work "How Financial Regulation Can get Europe out of the Crisis" was published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hesam.eu/blog/2014/06/12/journee-scientifique-du-labex-refi/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518080159/http://www.hesam.eu/blog/2014/06/12/journee-scientifique-du-labex-refi/ |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Program ===
Labex ReFi is also aimed at developing programs dedicated to financial regulation. A seminar entitled "5 lessons on regulation" organized in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ([[ETH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ena.fr/index.php?/fr/actualites/Conference-Labex-Refi-The-Governance-of-Industrial-Foundations-mardi-15-mai-2012|title=Page d'accueil|first=|last=Actimage|website=ENA}}&lt;/ref&gt;) bring together students from partner institutions in the context of lectures delivered by international lecturers. Other courses are provided involving professionals with extensive practical market or accounting information experience, collectively addressing students from all partner institutions and even from executive education. Ultimately, the aim is to create a "school of regulation" with European scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucien-pons.over-blog.com/article-la-reglementation-financiere-decryptee-par-labex-refi-rendre-le-monopole-de-la-creation-monetaire-a-112904309.html|title=La réglementation financière décryptée par Labex Réfi.

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">{{linguistics}}
The term "'''linguistic ecology'''" (also known as "'''ecolinguistics'''" or "'''language ecology'''") was first used in an article on the "language situation" in Arizona (Voegelin, Voegelin and Schutz, 1967).

==Description==
It was taken up by [[Einar Haugen]], who pioneered a form of [[linguistics]] which used the metaphor of an ecosystem to describe the relationships among the diverse forms of language found in the world, and the groups of people who speak them. Linguistic ecology looks at how languages interact with each other and the places they are spoken in, and frequently argues for the preservation of [[endangered language]]s as an analogy of the preservation of [[biological species]].

Linguistic ecology has often been described as a form of [[ecolinguistics]] (e.g., in Fill and Mühlhäusler). However, some claim that this is more properly considered a form of sociolinguistics, since the focus is on humans and language, rather than the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. Steffensen (2007) has argued that separation of the metaphorical 'linguistic ecology' from ecolinguistics would be reductionist, because high [[linguistic diversity]] is associated with high [[biological diversity]] (see Bastardas-Boada 2002). The relationship between linguistic diversity&lt;ref&gt;(Esperanto with English subtitles) Evildea, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xdm1HcVdE Ĉu Esperanto savos aŭ estingos la aliajn lingvojn ?]'' (Will Esperanto save or extinguish the other languages), YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; and biodiversity is claimed to arise since local ecological knowledge is built into local language varieties and threatened if the local language is threatened by a more dominant language (see Mühlhäusler 1995). 

Linguistic ecology is represented by the journal ''Language Ecology'' which describes the field as follows:

"The ecology of language is a framework for the study of language as conceptualised primarily in Einar Haugen's 1971/72 work, where he defines language ecology as "the study of interactions between any given language and its environment". It was a reaction to the abstract notion of language – as a monolithic, decontextualised, static entity – propagated by [[Chomsky]], and it was conceived as a broad and interdisciplinary framework. In his use of 'ecology' as a metaphor from biology in linguistics, Haugen formulated ten questions which together comprehensively address factors pertaining to the positioning of languages in their environment. Each of these relates to a traditional sub-field of the study of language – encompassing historical linguistics, linguistic demography, sociolinguistics, contact, variation, philology, planning and policy,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Analysis of language policy discourses across the scales of space and time. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 202'', 7-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, N.H., &amp; Hult, F.M. (2008). Ecological language education policy. In B. Spolsky &amp; F.M. Hult (Eds.), ''Handbook of educational linguistics'' (pp. 280-296). Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; politics of language, [[ethnolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and typology – and each of them intersects with one or more of the other sub-fields.

==Summary==
Taken together, answering some or all of these questions is part of the enterprise of the ecology of language. Since then the notion of ecology in linguistics has evolved to address matters of social, educational,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.  (2012). Ecology and multilingual education. In C. Chapelle (Gen. Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of applied linguistics'' (Vol. 3, pp. 1835-1840).  Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; historical and developmental nature. With the development of ecology as a special branch of biology, and issues of the 20th and 21st centuries such as migration, hybridity and marginalisation coming to the fore, the notion of language ecology plays an important part in addressing broad issues of language and societal change, endangerment, human rights, as well as more theoretical questions of classification and perceptions of languages, as envisaged in Haugen's work" (''Language Ecology'' 2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29241">'''Latin manuscripts of the New Testament''' are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called ''versions''. They are important in [[textual criticism]], because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a ''witness'') to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the [[Codex Bezae]], early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have "crossed back over" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known [[Comma Johanneum]].

Latin manuscripts are divided into "Old Latin" and [[Vulgate]]. Old Latin manuscripts, also called ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' or ''Itala'', are so called not because they are written in [[Old Latin]] (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.

Unlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no such thing as a uniform version of the New Testament in Latin prior to Jerome's Vulgate". Elliott (1997:202).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382 AD [[Jerome]] began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts#Jerome's version|Jerome's version]] is known as the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, UBS4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification ==
=== Identification ===

The list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and ''The Greek New Testament'' ([[United Bible Societies|UBS]]4). Each manuscript is identified first by its [[Scribal abbreviation|siglum]] (the first column, '''s.''', in the table), as given by the [[critical apparatus]] of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter ''t'' refers to Codex Bernensis in the [[gospel]]s, but [[Liber Comicus]] elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.

Sigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an ''original'' document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten ''volumes'' (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition ([[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Codex Sangallensis]], "Book from [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]]") or rediscovery ([[Stonyhurst Gospel]]), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, "[[Book of Armagh]]"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, "[[Theodore Beza]]'s Book"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, "The Lectionary"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume ([[Codex Gigas]], "The Huge Book" or [[Codex Aureus (disambiguation)|Codex Aureus]], "The Gold Book"). The [[Book of Mulling]] is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.

==== Beuron numbers ====

The [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]] Ancient Latin Institute (''Vetus Latina Institut'') has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These ''Beuron numbers'' are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.

Beuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[General epistles]] (Gen), and is allocated number 5.
* Manuscripts 1-49 are witnesses to one or more Gospels.
* Manuscripts 50-74 are witnesses to Acts, General epistles or the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev).
* Manuscripts 75-89 are witnesses to [[Pauline epistles]] (Paul).
* Manuscripts 91-96 are [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es in Spanish Bibles.

=== Other issues ===

NA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (the [[Vulgate#Weber-Gryson (Stuttgart) edition|Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate]]).

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or [[facsimile]] editions may be inspected. This method involves [[Paleography|paleographical]] analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.

It must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, [[Codex Sangermanensis]] (g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses ''both'' to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.

== Old Latin ==

The table below employs the following conventions.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
* Content is given to the nearest book (sometimes chapter); verses and lacunae are not listed.
* Editions are those consulted by UBS4; in many cases, better editions are also available.
* Locations are given in [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form, unless linked to sources in other languages.
* Manuscripts will sometimes be referred to as "it" followed by the siglum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. 
# '''“The [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Geidai Connection]],”''' a group of artists around [[Kōji Enokura]] and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. 
# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

==Early life==
Muhammad Taqi Usmani was born on 5 October 1943&lt;ref name=fsc&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Justice Maulana Muhammad Taqi Usmani|publisher=Federal Shariat Court, Pakistan|accessdate=20 July 2017|url=http://federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/images/Former%20CJ_Jug_Reg_Immages/fj6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (5 Shawwal 1362 AH) in [[Deoband]], a city in the [[Saharanpur district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=albalagh&gt;[http://www.albalagh.net/taqi.shtml Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on albalagh.net website], Retrieved 20 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Usmani passed the Fazil-e-Arabi (Arabic language examination) with distinction, administered by the Punjab Board.&lt;ref name=fsc/&gt; In 1959 he graduated from the [[Ulama|`Alim]] course at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Brian Kettell p 28"&gt;Brian Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|047097804X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ijara&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Finance Scholars|url=http://ijaraloans.com/?p=91|publisher=IjaraLoans.com|date= 30 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then specialised in ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) under the guidance of his father,&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt; the Mufti of Darul Uloom Karachi, [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], receiving his ''Takhassus'' degree (equivalent to a PhD) in ''fiqh'' and ''ifta'' (issuance of Islamic legal opinions) from Darul Uloom Karachi in 1961, earning the title of ''Mufti''. He graduated from the [[University of Karachi]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1964, then received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] with distinction from the University of Karachi in 1967. He received a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Arabic literature]], with distinction, from the [[University of Punjab]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=ijara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian B. Kettell, Introduction to Islamic Banking and Finance, p 28. {{ISBN|1119990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani received ''ijaza'' to teach hadith from Islamic scholars including [[Muhammad Shafi (scholar)|Muhammad Shafi]], [[Muhammad Idris Kandhlawi]], [[Qari Muhammad Tayyib]], Saleemullah Khan, Mufti Rashid Ahmad Ludhianvi, Sahban Mahmud, Zafar Ahmad Usmani, [[Muhammad Zakariya Kandhalvi]], Hasan al-Mahshat, [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, Abi Al-Faid [[:id:Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani|Muhammad Yasin Al-Fadani]] Ash-[[Shafi'i]], and others.&lt;ref name=albalagh/&gt;

His Teachers also include Mufti Wali Hasan Tonki, the Grand Mufti of Jami' ul Uloom Al-Islamiyyah. He admired the academic methods of [[Mufti]] [[Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda]]h, of whom he wrote an Orbituary to after his demise in his Nuqoosh-e-Raftghaan. He is very close friends with his teacher's nephew Dr. 'Abdu-s-Sattar Abu Ghuddah.

In tradition to the scholars of Deoband, recognising the importance of Tasawwuf, he traversed the path under the guidance of his Shaikh Dr. Abdul Hai Arifi and Maulana [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]  both khulafa of Hakeemul Ummat Maulana [[Ashraf Ali Thanwi]].&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt; He is authorized by both of his mentors in Silsila e Ashrafia: Chistiyyah, Naqshbandiyah, Qadiriyah and Suharwardiyah. In addition to his busy schedule he is himself a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world, such as Moulana Sheikh Mohammad Luqman Sahib Ji of the renowned Abu Bakr Trust in Walsall, England.

Usmani pioneered the concept of [[Islamic banking]] in Pakistan when he established the [[Meezan Bank]]. Usmani has authored a number of books in Arabic, Urdu, and [[English language|English]] on Islamic topics in addition to a large number of articles on [[Islamic banking]] and [[Islamic finance|finance]] published in a number of journals and magazines. According to ''The Muslim 500'' website, he is a leading scholar of Islamic Finance, "Usmani's chief influence comes from his position as a global authority on the issue of Islamic finance."&lt;ref name=TheMuslim500/&gt;

In March 2004, [[United Arab Emirates]] Vice President and Prime Minister [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] presented an award to Taqi Usmani in recognition of his lifetime service and achievement in [[Islamic finance]] during the annual ''International Islamic Finance Forum'' (IIFF) in [[Dubai]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

In accordance with the tradition of the scholars of [[Deoband]] and recognising the importance of ''tasawwuf'', Usmani's ''bay'ah'' was accepted by Abdul Hai Arifi and [[Muhammad Masihullah Khan]]. Usmani is currently a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world and delivers weekly lectures on self-improvement at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] on Sundays between [[Asr|Asr Salaah]] and [[Maghrib|Maghrib Salaah]].&lt;ref name=ashrafiya&gt;[https://www.ashrafiya.com/sayyidi-mawlana-mohammad-taqi-usmani-db/ Profile of Muhammad Taqi Usmani on ashrafiya.com website], Retrieved 23 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently teaches [[Sahih Bukhari|Sahih al-Bukhari]], fiqh, and [[Islamic economics]] at [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] and is known for his ''Islahi Khutbat''. He was a key member of a team of scholars which helped declare [[Ahmadis]] non-Muslims by Pakistan's National Assembly during the era of former Pakistani president, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], in the 1970s. During the presidency of General [[Zia ul Haq]], he was instrumental in drafting laws pertaining to ''[[Hudood]]'', ''[[Qisas]]'' meaning ''retaliation in kind'' or ([[eye for an eye]], and ''[[Diyya]]'' (blood money).

==Views==
Usmani strongly opposes elements of modernity, which he describes as engulfing

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the whole world in the tornado of nudity and obscenity, and has provided an excuse for fornication, and more so it has led under thunder claps to the passage of a bill in the British House of Commons to legalize homosexuality. It is in the shadow of the same modernity that Western women are openly displaying banners on the streets demanding legalization of abortion ....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/IslamAndModernismByMuftiTaqiUsmani/42345132-Islam-and-Modernism_djvu.txt |page=6 |last1=Taqi Usmani |first1=Muhammad |title=Islam and Modernism |accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also strongly supports Pakistan's [[Hudood Ordinances]] he helped write and strongly opposed the [[Women's Protection Bill]], which he believes violates the injunctions of Quran and Sunnah. He thinks it will not provide a great relief to countless women.

At a religious conference in 1984 he urged a more "dynamic attitude" towards the practice of ''[[ijtihad]]'', arguing there is no shortage of fine minds capable of interpreting the sharia, but warning against the contamination of sharia by Western ideas such as the elimination of [[hudood]] penalties such as amputation and [[stoning]].&lt;ref name=kadri-228&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|pages=228–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usmani&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usmani|first1=Taqi|title=THE ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE.

[[File:Ossia-vclo.jpg|thumb|360px|Ossia example (2nd bar).&lt;br /&gt;{{audio|Ossia-vclo.mid|Play original}} {{audio|Ossia-vclo-ossia.mid|Play ossia}}]]
'''''{{Lang|it|Ossia}}''''' {{IPA-it|osˈsiːa|}} is a musical term for an alternative passage which may be played instead of the original passage. The word ''[[Wikt:ossia|ossia]]'' comes from the Italian for "alternatively" and was originally spelled ''o sia'', meaning "or be it" (Fallows 774).

''Ossia'' passages are very common in [[opera]] and solo-[[piano]] works. They are usually an easier version of the preferred form of passage, but in [[Mily Balakirev]]'s ''[[Islamey]]'', for instance, the [[Urtext edition|urtext]] has ossia passages of both types (simpler and more difficult). [[Bel canto]] vocal music also frequently uses ''ossia'', also called ''[[Wikt:oppure|oppure]]'', passages to illustrate a more embellished version of the vocal line (Fallows 774).

On the other hand, an ''ossia'' marking does not always indicate a change in difficulty; the piano solo music of [[Franz Liszt]] is typically full of alternative passages, often no easier or more difficult than the rest of the piece. This reflects Liszt's desire to leave his options open during a performance. Many of his ''ossia'' passages are [[cadenza]]s.

An unusual use of ''ossia'' is found in Alban Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] where several ''ossia'' parts are included for the solo violin. If the soloist chooses to play these, the [[concertmaster]] is required to play a different ossia (which takes part of the solo violin line that is lost in favor of the soloist's ossia).

'''Pivot Legal Society''' is a legal advocacy organization based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]]. Founded in 2000, Pivot's stated aim is to represent and defend the marginalized and disenfranchised.

==Hope in Shadows==

[[Hope in Shadows]] is a photography contest organized by Pivot Legal Society, for residents of the Downtown Eastside since 2003. Every summer, up to 200 residents are given single-use cameras and encouraged to capture their community and their lives through images. The contest is designed to raise awareness about life in the Downtown Eastside, presenting reality from a distinctly personal point of view. Forty photographs are chosen by a panel of Vancouver artists and photographers, which are put on display on the street outside the Carnegie Community Centre. Here, local residents can vote to select the winning entries, which are compiled in an annual calendar, sold by residents on the streets of Vancouver. In 2010 216 local residents received job training to sell the 2011 Hope in Shadows calendar. More than $130,000 was earned by licensed street vendors selling 2011 calendars. The calendar sales were a 10% increase over the previous year. The Hope in Shadows book which won the 2008 City of Vancouver Book Award in October 2008 and has now sold more than 5,000 copies on the streets (if they had been sold in bookstores it would be an official B.C. Best Seller). Many of the calendar and book sellers are photographers in the competition. The 2011 contest will be held June 1–4. The top 40 pictures will be exhibited in the Pendulum Gallery in October, and the 2012 calendar will become available on October 4, 2011. Past Hope in Shadows photographs can be viewed on Flickr via the Hope in Shadows website.

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

'''''Powell v. State of Georgia''''', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998){{ref|citation}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]].  Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house.  The jury [[acquit]]ted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but [[convicted]] him of consensual sodomy.

In its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 186]] (1986).

In ''Bowers'', the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had observed in his ''Bowers'' dissent that ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either.

The Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6-1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The majority noted that "privacy rights protected by the U.S. Constitution are not at issue in this case," while the dissenting justice cited ''Bowers'' extensively.

Powell's conviction was overturned.

Although this case involved [[heterosexual]] activity, the decision overturned the state's [[sodomy law]] and had the effect of making [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sexual activity legal in the State of Georgia. Sodomy laws were overturned nationwide five years later, when ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) overruled ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.

{{Psychology sidebar}}
'''Psychogenic disease''' (or '''psychogenic illness''') is a name given to physical illnesses that are believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=E. C H|last2=Seet|first2=R. C S|title=What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=1 February 2007|volume=100|issue=2|pages=60–61|doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.2.60|pmid=17277261|pmc=1790983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly applied to illnesses where a physical abnormality or other biomarker has not yet been identified. In the absence of such "biological" evidence of an underlying disease process, it is often assumed that the illness must have a psychological cause, even if the patient shows no indications of being under stress or of having a psychological or psychiatric disorder.

Examples of diseases that are believed by many to be psychogenic include [[psychogenic seizures]], [[psychogenic polydipsia]], [[psychogenic tremor]] and [[psychogenic pain]].

There are problems with the assumption that all medically unexplained illness must have a psychological cause. It always remains possible that genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological or other abnormalities may be present which we do not have the technology or background to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|287464|Conversion Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Richard|title=Medically Unexplained Symptoms and the Siren "Psychogenic Inference"|journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology|date=2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=289–299|doi=10.1353/ppp.2010.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term psychogenic disease is often used in a similar way to [[psychosomatic]] disease. However, the term "psychogenic" usually implies that psychological factors played a key causal role in the development of the illness. The term "psychosomatic" is often used in a broader way to describe illnesses with a known medical cause where psychological factors may nonetheless play a role (e.g., asthma can be exacerbated by anxiety).

The '''Qatar Computing Research Institute''' (QCRI) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], is a nonprofit multidisciplinary computing research institute founded by the [[Qatar Foundation]] (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development in 2010. It is primarily funded by the Qatar Foundation, a private, non-profit organization that is supporting Qatar on its journey from carbon economy to [[knowledge economy]]. 

==Background==
QCRI is one of the three national research institutes under Qatar Foundation and specializes in applied computing research. Its research fall into two main categories: core computing and multidisciplinary computing. Within core computing, QCRI specializes in internet computing (with an emphasis on cloud computing and social networking), data analysis, and advanced computer hardware design. Within multidisciplinary computing, QCRI is focused on Arabic language technologies, high performance computing, and bioinformatics.

QCRI has offices in the [[Hamad Bin Khalifa University|HBKU]] Research Complex, in [[Doha]]'s [[Education City]].  QCRI has a staff of 90+ employees.

==Origins==
QCRI grew out of a series of meetings held by the Qatari Arab Joint Committee (QAJC) analyzing the needs of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;"Qatar Computing Research Institute looks to 'shake computer science'". Business Intelligence Middle East. 18 August 2010. http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?c=3&amp;cg=3&amp;t=1&amp;id=47875 Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group found that Qatar Foundation funded basic computing research at academic institutions worldwide through [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF) and that it incubated the development of new commercial computing products through Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), but it lacked a research organization focused on computing grand challenges that address national priorities for growth and development.

QCRI was established in 2010 with a mandate to tackle large-scale computing challenges relevant to the needs of Qatari stakeholders.  The stakeholders include Qatari industry, Qatar’s government, and Qatari society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"Main Customers and Stakeholders". Qatar Computing Research Institute. 1 March 2011. https://www.qcri.org/about-qcri{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, QCRI’s customers include the petroleum industry, the telecommunications industry, the healthcare industry, and the media industry. The petroleum industry needs advanced computer modeling to assist in the extraction and movement of petroleum products. The telecommunications and datacenter industries need the most advanced research in computing networks, broadband, and other forms of advanced computing infrastructure. The healthcare industry needs efficient and secure management of electronic patient records, clinical information systems, and data interoperability protocols for the exchange and sharing of data. The media industry needs solutions for the cataloging and retrieval of vast amounts of content generated through audio and video, and it needs Arabic language technology solutions to digitize and publish the vast Arabic language corpora.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; QCRI also works closely with both the basic research institutes in Qatar, including the [[Education City]] Universities on their most promising basic research findings. It also will work closely with [[QSTP]] to identify the most viable commercial applications of QCRI’s research.

==Activities==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2015}}
Research topics investigated by the QCRI include Arabic language computer technologies, [[computer security]] and [[data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2014/QCRI_connection.html|title=Karem Sakallah Continues Commitment to Qatar Computing Research Institute|publisher=Computer Science and Engineering School, University of Michigan|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic Language Technology Ecosystem Grand Challenge is to have an Arabic Language Technology research community in the Arab world of 100 specialized researchers, research engineers, and developers. The Arabic Machine Translation Grand Challenge hopes to realize machine translation for translating text or speech for 20 languages to and from Arabic. The Arabic Intelligent Support System Grand Challenge is a campaign to provide seamless multimodal Arabic content access and processing in 25% of newly authored software that handle Arabic in the Middle East. The Arabic Automated Language Tutor Grand Challenge assists in Arabic language learning for 1 million students via an interactive Arabic language tutor that teaches literacy, phonics, and grammar. The Seamless Arabic Dialogue System Grand Challenge is to transform 50% of automated commercial customer facing in Qatar to Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. The Arabic Content and Search Grand Challenge will try to make Arabic a tier 1 language on the web and in the enterprise in terms content, search, and services.

== Sponsors and partners ==
QCRI's principal sponsor is the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. QCRI conducts research and development in collaboration with various organizations, including [[Qatari Diar]], [[Aljazeera| Aljazeera Network]], Microsoft Research, and Yahoo! QCRI also collaborates with other computing research institutes, including [[MIT]], [[Columbia University]], [[University of Waterloo]], and [[Purdue University]].

Laherrère and D. Sornette&lt;/ref&gt; except in the cases of the two "[[King effect|Kings]]": [[China]] and [[India]].]]
'''Rank-size distribution''' is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the '''rank-frequency distribution''', when the source data are from a [[frequency distribution]]. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a [[power law]] distribution, or less well-known ones such as a [[stretched exponential function]] or [[parabolic fractal distribution]], at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.

A rank-size distribution is not a [[probability distribution]] or [[cumulative distribution function]]. Rather, it is a discrete form of a [[quantile function]] (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.

==Simple rank-size distributions==
In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[[List of United States cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}

When any [[log-linear]] factor is ranked, the ranks follow the [[Lucas numbers]], which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous [[Fibonacci sequence]], each number is approximately 1.618 (the [[Golden ratio]]) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An [[equiangular spiral]] is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.

== Segmentation ==
[[File:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|Wikipedia word frequency plot, showing three segments with distinct behavior.]]

A rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for [[market segmentation]], but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.

Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two, termed the '''head''' and '''tail'''. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically '''middle''',&lt;ref name="fishkin"&gt;[https://moz.com/blog/illustrating-the-long-tail Illustrating the Long Tail], Rand Fishkin, November 24th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; also '''belly''',&lt;ref name="young"&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2006/09/04/digg-that-fat-belly/ Digg that Fat Belly!], Robert Young, Sep. 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''torso''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/08/03/09/long-tail-guide The Long Tail Keyword Optimization Guide - How to Profit from Long Tail Keywords], August 3, 2009, Tom Demers&lt;/ref&gt; and '''body'''.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx The Small Head, the Medium Body, and the Long Tail .. so, where's Microsoft?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025939/http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx |date=2015-11-17 }}, 12 Mar 2005, Lawrence Liu's Report from the Inside&lt;/ref&gt; These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly ''[[long tail]]'', also ''fat belly'',&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; ''chunky middle'', etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called ''top-tier'', ''mid-tier'', and ''bottom-tier''.

The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the [[skewness]] or [[kurtosis]] of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?

These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the [[90–9–1 principle]], which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving [[form letter]]s; and the line is simply as far as resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.

Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first ''p'' portion of ranks, which account for &lt;math&gt;1 - p&lt;/math&gt; of the overall population, as in the 80:20 [[Pareto principle]], where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power laws can be computed from the [[Pareto index]].

Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the [[king effect]], where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a [[piecewise function]]. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a [[broken power law]] for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.

The [[Yule–Simon distribution]] that results from [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" and "success breeds success") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to "very well capture" word frequency versus rank distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf | title=Scaling laws in human speech, decreasing emergence of new words and a generalized model | author=Lin, Ruokuang|author2=Ma, Qianli D. Y.|author3=Bian, Chunhua | year=2014 | arxiv=1412.4846|bibcode=2014arXiv1412.4846L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species. It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a110361|title=A Growth Process for Zipf's and Yule's City-Size Laws|first=M F|last=Dacey|date=1 April 1979|publisher=|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=11|issue=4|pages=361–372|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/a110361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rank-size rule ==
The '''rank-size rule''' (or '''law'''), describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals.

All are real-world observations that follow [[power law]]s, such as [[Zipf's law]], the [[Yule distribution]], or the [[Pareto distribution]]. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the [[natural logarithm]] of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a [[log-linear]] pattern.{{dubious|date=March 2013}} This is the rank-size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213211558/http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ |date=2007-02-13 }} Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical rationale===

One study claims that the rank size rule "works" because it is a "shadow" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/image/monog08/fulltext.pdf The Urban Rank-Size Hierarchy] James W. Fonseca&lt;/ref&gt; The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or "rule of thumb" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest-ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship.

==Known exceptions to simple rank-size distributions==

While Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the [[King effect]]. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0641.pdf|title=Kwok Tong Soo (2002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302005906/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cuberes, David, The Rise and Decline of Cities, University of Chicago, September 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the [[United States]], although its largest city, [[New York City]], has more than twice the population of second-place [[Los Angeles]], the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the capital, [[Kinshasa]], is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, [[Lubumbashi]]. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]. This follows from [[Gibrat's law]] of proportionate growth.

Because exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries.  The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established.  A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant "[[primate city]]" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner.  Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city.  Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern.  If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank-size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern.  For example—the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule.  By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities—the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.

'''Shanghai Ocean University''' ({{zh|c=上海海洋大学}}) is a [[public university]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].

The university changed its name to the current name on 6 May 2008, authorized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education The People's Republic of China]], and the whole school was to be moved to [[Lingang New City]] in August 2008. Its former name is Shanghai Fisheries University (上海水产大学). It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1912, Shanghai Ocean University was on the bank of the Huangpu River, with an area of 700,000 square meters. The university is characterized by aquaculture, food science, fishery economics, fishery laws, and stresses the coordinated development of multiple disciplines and expertise in agriculture, science, engineering, economics, arts and management.

==Academics==
The university consists of nine schools: Fishery, Oceanology, Food Science, Economics and Trade, Information, Humanities, Further Education, Vocational and Technical Education, AIEN (Sino-Australian Cooperated).

In addition to one state-level key discipline, two municipal-level key disciplines, three department-level key disciplines, and the right of conferring doctorate of aquaculture (the first level state discipline which covers two second-level disciplines), the university has 14 graduate programs, 23 undergraduate specialties and 18 specialties for junior college students. There are 10000 regular students (including Ph.D. students, graduates, undergraduates and students of higher vocational school) and 3700 students for further education. Of the staff members 200 teachers hold senior academic titles (professor and associate professor). The Shanghai Ocean University library has a collection of 460,000 books featured with fishery science.

The university takes the nationwide lead in such academic fields as Ichthyology, Aquatic Animal Proliferation and Breeding, Fish Diseases Prevention, Fish Nutrition and Feeds, Fish Species and Quality Resources, Seaweed Cells Engineering, Fishing Gear and Methodology, Fishery Machinery, Preservation and Management of Fishery Resources, Fishery Regulations and Policy, Fishery Economics, Biological Technology, Marine Ecology, Food Science and Engineering, Refrigeration and Cryogenics.

==International presence==
Shanghai Ocean University has made agreeable advances in international cooperation and communication. It has enrolled many international students who are pursuing doctorate or graduate and undergraduate degrees. As for the training courses and further education, subjects as Chinese Techniques of Aquatic Breeding, Development of Marine Fishery and Preservation of Fishery Resources, Chinese Language, Chinese Traditional Culture have formed their own features and gained their own advantages. Up to now the university has established long-term academic cooperation with more than 40 foreign institutions of higher education and research.

Following the school spirit of Solidarity, Dedication, Reality and Originality, the university is determined to keep pace with the worldwide competition, strive to build itself into a first-rate university famous at home and abroad for its featured multidisciplinary development in teaching and scientific research.

Silla is a spirit of the sky, the wind, and the weather. Though identified as male, he is never depicted, and thought to be formless. There are very few myths in which Silla is a character, because he is not thought to have many personality characteristics. He also represents a concept somewhat akin to the [[Hindu]] idea of [[Paramatman]], or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]’s idea of the great [[Ralph Waldo Emerson#Literary career|Over soul]]: Silla is also believed to be the substance which [[souls]] are made of. Contrary to the Christian missionaries who have identified [[Nanook]] the [[polar bear]] spirit as the supreme deity of the Inuit, Silla is much closer to this role. However Silla also has a somewhat malevolent aspect: he is known to lure children away from their play off into the tundra, never to be seen again.

Among the many various  [[Eskimo]] cultures, term ''silap inua'' / ''sila'', ''hillap inua'' / ''hilla'' (among [[Inuit]]), ''siḷam iñua'' (among [[Inupiaq]]), ''ellam yua'' / ''ella'' (among [[Yup'ik]]) is used with some diversity.&lt;ref name="Kleivan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleivan|first1=I.|last2=Sonne|first2=B.|title=Eskimos, Greenland and Canada|date=1985|publisher=E.J.

[[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|Shamanhood among Eskimo peoples]] was a diverse phenomenon, just like the various Eskimo cultures themselves. Among [[Copper Inuit]], shamans were believed to obtain their power from this “Wind Indweller”, thus even their helping spirits were termed as ''silap inue''.&lt;ref name="Merkur"/&gt;{{rp|230}}

Among [[Siberian Yupik]], {{IPA-iu|sl̥am juɣwa|}} was depicted as a mighty hunter, catching game just like earthly men, but being capable of controlling whether people paid attention to customs and traditions.&lt;ref name="Diószegi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diószegi|first1=Vilmos|title=Popular Beliefs and Folklore Tradition in Siberia|date=1997|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|isbn=0700703802|page=447|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sireniki Eskimo language]], the word {{IPA-iu|siˈlʲa|}} has meanings “universe”, “outer world”, “space”, “free space”, “weather”.&lt;ref name="Menovshchikov"&gt;{{cite book |last=Menovshchikov |first=G.A. |title=Language of Sirenik Eskimos.

==History==
According to the interpretations of [[anthropologists]], Silla is one of the oldest Inuit deities, but was recently (in the last thousand years) supplanted by [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], (the goddess of [[sea mammals]]) and the [[Caribou Mother]] (the goddess  of [[caribou]]) when these became the major food sources of the Inuit. Anthropologists believe that the belief is extremely old because of the widespread nature of this deity.

{{short description|set of 17 global development goals defined by the United Nations for the year 2030}}
[[File:UN SDG Logo.png|thumb|The Sustainable Development Goals are a UN Initiative.|269x269px]]{{redirect|SDG}}

'''Sustainable Development Goals''' ('''SDGs''') (or '''Global Goals for Sustainable Development''', the '''17 Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''the Goals"'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;: "Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "'''2030 Agenda'''."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|website=United Nations – Sustainable Development knowledge platform|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve. Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and economic development issues including [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[global warming]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 54 of [[ the United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/70/1 of 25 September 2015 contains the goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-led process involved its 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|Member States]] and global [[civil society]]. The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled "The Future We Want".&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/rio-20-summit-the-future-we-want/ |title=United Nations Official Document |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a non-binding document released as a result of [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] held in 2012.&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"/&gt;

Implementation as of 2016 is described as "Localizing the SDGs" to highlight the role of local institutions and local actors.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Regional efforts included agreements like the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]]&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;. Some remain pessimistic about the potential for achieving the SDGs, especially because of estimates of the cost of achieving all 17.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  However, progress had been reported by 2018. For example, fewer African children under the age of 5 are suffering from [[Stunted growth|stunting]] and wasting. However, the same study concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to [[malnutrition]] by 2030.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   {{TOC limit|3}}

[[File:UN SDGs consulltations in Mariupol (29274119644).jpg|thumb|UN SDG consultations in Mariupol, Ukraine]]

In 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden, for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the United Nations created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as Agenda 21, was developed and adopted.

In 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]], was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliver2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-short-history-of-the-SDGs-Paula-Caballero.pdf|title=A Short History of the SDGs|last=Caballero|first=Paula|date=April 29, 2016|website=Deliver 2030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118221940/http://deliver2030.org/wp%2Dcontent/uploads/2016/04/A%2Dshort%2Dhistory%2Dof%2Dthe%2DSDGs%2DPaula%2DCaballero.pdf|archive-date=2017-11-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] 64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as "The Future We Want" was reached by member states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|title=Future We Want – Outcome document .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.

The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that “at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly’s Sixty-eighth Session &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposal|title=Home .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]]'s Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/700&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] from 2007 to 2016, has stated that: "We don’t have plan B because there is no planet B!."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/11/secretary-generals-remarks-to-the-press-at-cop22/|title=Secretary-General’s remarks to the press at COP22|date=15 November 2016|website=UN|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.&lt;ref name="post-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|year=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.&lt;ref name="post-2015"/&gt;

=== Ratification ===
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on Financing for Development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in New York City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda has 92 paragraphs. Paragraph 51 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets.

== Implementation ==

Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time.&lt;ref name="globalcitizen.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Global governance for SDGs|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/peer-pressure-can-contribute-achieving-sdgs-more-needed|author=Belay Begashaw|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 April 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent campaign "Project Everyone" has met some resistance.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africaplatform.org/news/why-this-is-sustainable-development-not-global-goals/|title=Why this is Sustainable Development Not Global Goals – Africa Platform|website=Africaplatform.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored "[[sustainability]]" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicywatch.org/blog/2015/09/25/public-sdgs-or-private-ggs/|title=Public SDGs or Private GGs? – Global Policy Watch|website=Globalpolicywatch.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that while "nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood-Zimmerman|first=Aaron|last2=Millear|first2=Anoushka I.|last3=Stubbs|first3=Rebecca W.|last4=Shields|first4=Chloe|last5=Pickering|first5=Brandon V.|last6=Earl|first6=Lucas|last7=Graetz|first7=Nicholas|last8=Kinyoki|first8=Damaris K.|last9=Ray|first9=Sarah E.|date=2018|title=Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7694|pages=41–47|doi=10.1038/nature25760|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" written by Ambassador David Donoghue, Felix Dodds and Jimena Leiva as well as "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by Macharia Kamau, David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek.

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] has observed that UK and [[European Union]] [[pension fund|pension investors]] have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and [[early adopter]]s of “SDG-centric” investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement ==
[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]
UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals&lt;/ref&gt; They also shortened the title "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals" to "[[Global Goals]]/17#GlobalGoals," then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewdivision.world/global-goals-branding|title=the-new-division|website=the-new-division|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/slideshows/designing-the-global-goals-for-everyone|title=How This Great Design Is Bringing World Change to the Masses|date=2015-09-24|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalfestivalofideas.org/|title=Global Festival of Action – Global Festival of Action|website=globalfestivalofideas.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis approached Swedish designer [[sv:Jakob Trollbäck]] who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgoals.org/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Jakob Trollbäck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewdivision.world&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Le Temps Presse festival ===
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the Millennium Development Goals. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letempspresse.org/fr/le-festival/|title=Le Temps Presse|last=|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=Le Temps Presse|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17 goals==
There are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 304 indicators that will measure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/6754Technical%20report%20of%20the%20UNSC%20Bureau%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Technical report by the Bureau of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) on the process of the development of an indicator framework for the goals and targets of the post-2015 development agenda – working draft|date=March 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations General Assembly Draft outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda|website=UN|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal. Directly below each goal, in quotation marks, is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence.

[[File:Sustainable Development Goals chart.svg|thumb|787x787px|A diagram listing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals|center]]

=== Goal 1: No poverty ===

==== "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-1-no-poverty.html|title=Goal 1: No poverty|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Extreme poverty]] has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, more than 1 in 5 people live on less than the target figure of US$1.25 per day. That target may not be adequate for human [[subsistence]], however. Some suggest it may be necessary to raise the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] figure to as high as $5 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/global-poverty-climate-change-sdgs/|title=The Problem with Saving the World {{!}} Jacobin|website=www.jacobinmag.com|access-date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources. People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social [[discrimination]], and exclusion from decision-making processes.

Children make up the majority – more than half – of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early [[pregnancy]] and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.

Achieving Goal 1 is hampered by growing inequality, increasingly [[Fragile state|fragile statehood]], and the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]].&lt;ref name="D+C/E+Z"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/eradicate-extreme-poverty-ultra-poor-need-be-reached|title=Programmes for the poorest of the poor|author=Jörn Geisselmann|date=29 April 2017|work=D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 2: Zero hunger ===
==== "[[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|End hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.

Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide,&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014. [http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/128045 An ambitious development goal: Ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025]. In 2013 Global food policy report. Eds. Marble, Andrew and Fritschel, Heidi. Chapter 2. Pp 15-28. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"/&gt;

=== Goal 3: Good health and well-being for people ===
==== "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-3-good-health-and-well-being.html|title=Goal 3: Good health and well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; 

Goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data for girls of greatest concern – those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000-2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15-19.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].

Goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of [[substance abuse]], deaths and injuries from [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]] and from hazardous chemicals and air, [[Water pollution|water]] and soil pollution and contamination.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

=== Goal 4: Quality education ===
==== "Ensure [[inclusion (education)|inclusive]] and [[educational equity|equitable]] quality education and promote [[lifelong learning]] opportunities for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-4-quality-education.html|title=Goali 4: Quality education|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the [[primary school]] level, for both boys and girls. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

Additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

=== Goal 5: Gender equality ===


==== "Achieve [[gender equality]] and [[empowerment|empower]] all women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-5-gender-equality.html|title=Goal 5: Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
According to the UN, "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.

[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 05. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – Indicators and a Monitoring Framework|url=http://indicators.report/goals/goal-5/|website=indicators.report|publisher=indicators.report|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated for "listening to girls". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Anna|title=21 ways the SDGs can have the best impact on girls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/21-ways-the-sdgs-can-have-the-best-impact-on-girls|accessdate=5 August 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has insisted on the transformational role [[Gender diversity|gender-diverse]] that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as “more than ever before, many UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation ===

==== "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 6}}

The [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]] (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"/&gt; Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed water services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. "Equitable sanitation" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the users.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt; This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko, Tan, Tay Keong, Flynn, Patricia M.|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines].

=== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ===
==== "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] and modern energy for all."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

As of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology, falling short of the 95 percent target.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ===
==== "Promote sustained, inclusive and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], full and productive employment and [[decent work]] for all."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren’t prioritized enough. Being prioritized as number 8 and number 9 respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking and defies common sense''"''&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"/&gt;

For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

By 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ===
==== "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Resilience (engineering and construction)|Urban resilience}}
Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ===
==== "Reduce income [[social inequality|inequality]] within and among countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries. "Duty-free treatment" has expanded. As of 2015, 65 percent of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free, as compared to 41 percent in 2005.

The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as [[Remittance|remittances]]). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical "remittance corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10|title=Progress of Goal 10 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 Nov 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goal Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities ===
==== "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html|title=Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and [[affordable housing]]. The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in [[Slum|slums]] or [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]. Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11|title=Sustainable Development Goal 11|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production ===
==== "Ensure [[sustainable consumption]] and production patterns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html|title=Goal 12: Responsible consumption, production|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Sustainable products}}
The targets of Goal 12 include using [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national [[recycling]] rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.

Target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12|title=Goal 12 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework, adopted by member states at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]], is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rio20.un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216-5_english.pdf|title=A/CONF.216/5: A 10-Year Framework of Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the [[One Planet Network]] have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/platform-sustainable-development-goal-12 Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 13: Climate action ===
==== "Take urgent action to combat [[Global warming|climate change]] and its impacts by regulating [[emission of greenhouse gases|emissions]] and promoting developments in [[renewable energy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html|title=Goal 13: Climate action|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the [[Financing for Development]] process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2015/december/COP21-paris-climate-conference.html|title=Paris Climate Change Conference: COP21|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Impact-of-climate-on-SDGs-technical-report-CDKN.pdf|title=The impact of climate change on the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development goals|last2=Greño, P|date=May 2015|publisher=CDKN &amp; HR Wallingford|last3=Houlden, V|display-authors=et al.|last1=Ansuategi, A|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around [[poverty]], [[gender equality]], and energy. The UN encourages the [[public sector]] to take initiative in this effort to minimize [[environmental impact|negative impacts on the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/no9.pdf&amp;embedded=true|title=Sustainable Development Innovation Briefs, Issue 9|last=|first=|date=March 2010|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial [[China–United States relations|Sino-American]] convergence that developed in 2015-2016, notably at the UN [[COP21]] summit (Paris) and ensuing [[G20]] conference (Hangzhou).&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth|title=Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth?|date=October 2016|work=Analyse Financière|first1=M. Nicolas J.|last1=Firzli|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Asia-Pacific region needs more [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCEOA Chairman Underscores the Value of Big Data for the SDGS |url=http://www.globalceoalliance.org/news-and-events/gceoa-chairman-underscores-the-value-of-big-data-for-the-sdgs/ |website=Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Press release |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 14: Life below water ===
==== "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html|title=Goal 14: Life below water|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Ocean]]s cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are essential for making the planet livable. [[Rainwater]], [[drinking water]] and climate are all regulated by [[ocean temperature]]s and [[ocean current|currents]]. Over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. Oceans absorb 30 percent of all [[carbon dioxide]] produced by humans.&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"&gt;UNDP2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein. However, there has been a 26 percent increase in [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] since the [[industrial revolution]]. A full 30 percent of [[marine habitat]]s have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world's [[fish stocks]] are [[overfishing|over-exploited]].&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Marine pollution]] has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"&gt;WWF2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} 20 percent of all [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;UN2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans.

Individuals can help the oceans by reducing their [[energy consumption]] and their use of plastics. Nations can also take action. In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tesdal Galtung |first1=Anders |last2=Rolfsnes |first2=May-Helen |title=Finn.no kjøper sekker med havplast |url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/finn.no-kjoper-sekker-med-havplast-1.13599585 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=NRK |date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, including Kenya, have [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags|banned the use of plastic bags]] for retail purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya plastic bag ban comes into force after years of delays |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41069853 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving the oceans contributes to [[poverty reduction]], as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.&lt;ref name="UN2016"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and [[coastal ecosystem]]s, and [[fishing regulation|regulating fishing]]. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fsustainabledevelopment%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf&amp;embedded=true&amp;chrome=false&amp;dov=1 [[chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg|link=]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 15: Life on land ===
==== "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, sustainably manage forests, combat [[desertification]], and halt and reverse [[land degradation]] and halt [[biodiversity]] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html|title=Goal 15: Life on land|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. Achieving a "land degradation-neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of [[introduced species]] and more protection of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/advocacy/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/mountain-green-cover-index/en/|title=Mountain Partnership: working together for mountain peoples and environment|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Mountain Partnership|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg15|title=Sustainable Development Goal 12|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development UN|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal extinction is a growing problem.

=== Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ===
==== "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide [[right to fair trial|access to justice]] for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions.html|title=Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Reducing [[violent crime]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and [[child abuse]] are clear global goals. The International Community values [[peace]] and [[justice]] and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also [[violence against women]]). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.

One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sdg16report.org/|title=SDG16 Data Initiative 2017 Global Report|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=SDG16 Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723064355/http://sdg16report.org/|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

SDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and [[Birth certificate|birth registration]], ensuring the right to a name and nationality, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals ===
==== "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for [[sustainable development]].“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-17-partnerships-for-the-goals.html|title=Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Increasing [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]] is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. [[Public–private partnership|Public-private partnerships]] that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17|title=Sustainable Development Goal 17|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women and gender equality ===
There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically – by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen’s House: ESG and Asset Ownership|url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= Revue Analyse Financière|publisher=Revue Analyse Financière|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/POST-2015%20Gender.pdf|title=Gender equality and women’s rights in the post-2015 agenda: A foundation for sustainable development|format=PDF|website=Oecd.org|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and sustainable development ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives UNESCO, 2015 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf|title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100209-0|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality [[Higher education|Higher Education]] to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 ("Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"&lt;ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

==Criticisms==

=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development. Finally, the MDGs used a  sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Whilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Competing goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
First, some of the SDGs might be contradictory. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] (as opposed to qualitative economic development and the goal of better distribution of the economic product) might undermine [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].

Second, the goal of achieving sustainable human population and lifestyle levels, and the scientific issues of matching ecosystems (and the Earth as a whole) to the number of human beings that they can sustainably support at a certain life-style level, seem neglected and largely unarticulated. Human population levels and reproductive rates are independent variables in trying to reach the SDGs and in aiming at an overall sustainable Earth/Human Community, they need to be scientifically recognized as such.

Third, in addition to population and lifestyle issues, three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the promotion of [[multidisciplinary]] and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;. 

Fourth, the issues of demilitarization, disarmament, and conversion to peace-based economies also seem neglected, along with the issues of corruption, drugs, robotization of jobs, the need for global citizenship education, the lack of reliable UN and SDG financing, and the current disempowering inability of citizens to participate directly in the global-level decision-making and priority-setting process and to thereby feel the collective togetherness needed for the success of the SDG effort.

=== Too many goals ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing.

=== High cost of achieving the SDGs ===
''The Economist'' estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2–3 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called "pure fantasy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847191468000296045/pdf/103172-PUB-Box394556B-PUBLIC-EPI-K8632-ADD-SERIES.pdf|title=The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene|last=Hutton|first=Guy|date=15 November 2017|website=Documents/World Bank|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms ===
Other views are more positive. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The Rockefeller Foundation asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|website=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|website=sphaera.world|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talmudical hermeneutics''' ([[Hebrew]]: מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Scriptures]], within the framework of Rabbinic Judaism. This includes, among others, the rules by which the requirements of the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]] and the [[Halakha]] are derived from and established by the written law.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

These rules relate to: 
* grammar and exegesis
* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes
* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with [[Niqqud|points]]
* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see [[Gematria]])
* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see [[Notarikon]])
* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization
* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels
* the logical deduction of a halakhah from a Scriptural text or from another law&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

== Classes of rules ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
Compilations of such [[hermeneutic]] rules were made in the earliest times. The [[tannaitic]] tradition recognizes three such collections,&lt;ref name=je/&gt; namely: 
# the 7 Rules of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]]&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name="avision"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sion|first=Avi|editor-first=Andrew|editor-last=Schumann|contribution =Talmudic Hermeneutics|title=Logic in religious discourse|year=2010|publisher=Ontos-Verl.|location=Frankfurt, M. [i.e.] Heusenstamm [u.a.]|isbn=978-3-86838-061-3|pages=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqI6IpwXBdoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]; [[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] xxxvii.)
# the 13 Rules of [[Rabbi Ishmael]]&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name="avision" /&gt; ([[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]] at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is merely an amplification of that of Hillel)
# the 32 Rules of Rabbi [[Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name="avision" /&gt; These last-mentioned rules are contained in an independent baraita ([[Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules]]) which has been incorporated and preserved only in later works. They are intended for haggadic interpretation, but many of them are valid for the Halakah as well, coinciding with the rules of Hillel and Ishmael.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor Eliezer ben Jose sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day. For some reason they restricted themselves to a compilation of the principal methods of logical deduction, which they called "[[middot (Talmud)|middot]]" (measures), although the other rules also were known by that term (comp. [[Sifre]], Num. 2 [ed. Friedmann, p.&amp;nbsp;2a]).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;.

Those rules are traditionally studied and applied to the [[religious texts]] of some [[biblical canon]], which were commonly believed to be inspired by God himself, through the words and the actions of human people. Therefore, those rules were related in coordination with the four independent level of biblical reading, as in the acronym [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]].

== Dates of the rules ==
All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet HaShachar,'' the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the [[tannaim|tanna]] to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though he possibly amplified them.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

The Talmud itself gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the [[Geonim]] regarded them as Sinaitic (הלכה למשה מסיני, "Law given to [[Moses]] at [[Mount Sinai]]"; comp. Rabbi [[Samson of Chinon]] in his ''Sefer HaKeritot'').&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

==Rules of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael==

[[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[Rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. Rabbi Akiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Rabbi Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles which guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

=== Superfluity in the text ===
According to Rabbi Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous. He established two principles broadening the scope of the rule of his teacher [[Nahum of Gimzo]], who had declared that certain particles, like את, גם and או, were inclusive and certain others, such as אך, רק and מן, were exclusive.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; These two principles are: 
* '''אין רבוי אחר רבוי אלא למעט''' (= "one inclusion added to another is equivalent to an exclusion"; Sifra, Ẓaw, Pereḳ, 11 [ed. [[I.H. Weiss]], p.&amp;nbsp;34d])
* '''לשונות רבויין הן''' (= "words are amplifications"; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] xix. 17a)&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
Hence he interprets the following forms of expression as amplifications: an infinitive before a finite verb, e.g., הכרת תכרת ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 64b); the doubling of a word, e.g., איש איש ([[Yeb.]] 71a); and the repetition of a term by a synonym, e.g., ודבר ואמר (Jerusalem Talmud [[Soṭah]] viii. 22b). Ishmael, on the contrary, lays down the principle, (דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם = "the Torah speaks in the language of men"; Sifre, Num. 112). The [[Bible]] may, therefore, have employed superfluous words and sounds; and forced values should not be assigned to them for the purpose of deducing new rules therefrom.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

The same statement holds with regard to the repetition of an entire section. Ishmael is of the opinion that "the Torah at times repeats a whole section of the [[halakha|Law]] in order to give a new application to it" (כל פרשה שנאמרה במקום אחד וחזרו שנאה במקום אחר לא שנאה אלא בשביל דבר שנתחדש בה ; Sifre, Num. 2, according to the reading of [[Elijah of Vilna]]). It is not necessary, therefore, to draw a new inference from every repetition. Thus, for instance, in [[Num.]] v. 5-8 the Torah repeats the section on אשם גזלות in [[Lev.]] v. 20-26 (vi. 1-7, A. V.) for the purpose of teaching the new ruling that in certain cases recompense for sin shall be made directly to the priests. Akiva asserts, on the other hand (in Sifre, l.c., according to the reading of Elijah of Vilna), that "Everything that is said in a section so repeated must be interpreted" (= כל מה שנאמר בה צריך להדרש), and that new deductions may be drawn from it. According to this view, in [[Num.]] v. 5-8, for example, a new meaning must be sought in the repetition of the Law.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Vocalization of words===
According to Akiva, the traditional vocalization in the Bible of a word which may be read in various ways is well founded (יש אם למקרא); and he deduces many rules from the meanings which such words have according to traditional pointing. This rule had been formulated before Akiva by a tanna named Rabbi Judah ben Ro'eẓ, who is not mentioned elsewhere, and of whom, consequently, nothing more is known (comp. Sanhedrin 4a). Ishmael, in opposition to Akiva, follows the principle יש אם למסורת, i.e., that the tradition regarding only the consonantal text is authoritative, and that rules may be deduced only from that text. A single example will serve to illustrate the difference between the methods of the two schools. In [[Lev.]] xxi. 11, in the law which forbids a priest to defile himself by touching a corpse, the word נפשת is written defectively. Since the traditional reading indicates the plural, "nafshot", Akiva draws the conclusion that a quarter-log of blood, the minimum quantity by which a priest may be rendered unclean through contact with a single corpse, also defiles him when it issues from two bodies. According to Ishmael, however, this minimum quantity defiles a priest only when it issues from a single corpse; for the word, according to the consonantal text, is to be read in the singular "nafshat" (comp. Sanhedrin 4a, b, [[Hullin]] 72a, and [[Tosafot]] to both passages).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Juxtaposition of sections===
According to Akiva, laws may be deduced from the juxtaposition of two legal sections, since "every passage which stands close to another must be explained and interpreted with reference to its neighbor" (כל פרשה שהיא סמוכה לחבירתה למדה הימנה; Sifre, Num. 131). According to Ishmael, on the contrary, nothing may be inferred from the position of the individual sections, since it is not at all certain that every single portion now stands in its proper place. Many a paragraph which forms, strictly speaking, the beginning of a book and should stand in that position, has been transposed to the middle. Ishmael explains the occurrence of a section in a place where it does not properly belong (ולמה נכתב כאן) by declaring that "there is no first or last in the Scriptures" (אלא מפני שאין מקדם ומאחר בתורה), not as due to any special reason ([[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]], ed. Weiss, p.&amp;nbsp;48a; [[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] i.; comp. [[Pesahim]] 6b, where [[Rav Papa]] defines this principle in such a manner that it does not contradict Ishmael's rules concerning "Kelal uferat"). Eliezer ben Jose expanded this rule in his baraita ([[Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules]]) and divided it into two parts (Nos. 31 and 32).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Nonetheless, this method is utilized in many instances, for example: [[Deuteronomy]] 22:11 speaks of the commandment forbidding the wearing of [[shaatnez]], a specific mixture of [[wool]] and [[linen]]. The next verse discussed the directive to make [[tzitzit]], the fringes tied to four-cornered garments. The juxtaposition of these two verses is used to teach that the transgression of shaatnez is not violated when one wears a four cornered garment of linen bearing tzitzis of wool (the wool here is actually the thread(s) of [[tekhelet]], a blue-dyed woolen thread. While the white strings of the tzitzit could be of any material, the blue string must be wool, even when the subsequent garment would be a mixture of wool and linen.)

Juxtaposition through "exemplification" or  משל has recently been described by Talmudist [[Daniel Boyarin]] as the ''sine qua non'' of Talmudic hermeneutics (Boyarin 2003: 93), for "until Solomon invented the ''[[Mashal (allegory)|mashal]]'', no one could understand Torah at all" (''Song of Songs Rabba''). The phenomenon has been compared to the more recent phenomenon of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in modern popular music, especially hip-hop ([http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/gjtp/2010/00000018/00000002/art00004 Levy 2010]).

===Fusion of methodologies===
The opposition between the schools of Ishmael and Akiva lessened gradually, and finally vanished altogether, so that the later [[tannaim]] apply the axioms of both indiscriminately, although the hermeneutics of Akiva predominated.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

== Detailed rules ==

===Kal va-chomer (קל וחומר)===
{{See also|A fortiori argument}}
The first rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael is "kal va-chomer" ({{lang-he|קל וחומר}}), called also "din" (conclusion). This is the argument "a minori ad majus" or "a majori ad minus". In the Baraita on the Thirty-two Rules this rule is divided into two (Nos. 5 and 6), since a distinction is made between a course of reasoning carried to its logical conclusion in the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] themselves ("kal va-chomer meforash") and one merely suggested there ("kal va-chomer satum"). The completed argument is illustrated in ten examples given in Genesis Rabbah xcii.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

The full name of this rule should be "kal va-chomer, chomer ve-kal" (simple and complex, complex and simple), since by it deductions are made from the simple to the complex or vice versa, according to the nature of the conclusion required. The major premise on which the argument is based is called "nadon", or, at a later period, "melammed" (that which teaches); the conclusion resulting from the argument is termed בא מן הדין ("ba min ha-din", that which "comes from the rule") or, later, "lamed" (that which learns). The process of deduction in the kal va-chomer is limited by the rule that the conclusion may contain nothing more than is found in the premise. This is the so-called "dayyo" law, which many teachers, however, ignored. It is formulated thus: דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון ("The conclusion of an argument is satisfied when it is like the major premise").&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

There is a dispute regarding the thirteen principles: Either the kal va-chomer is unique among the thirteen rules in that it may be applied by anyone in any circumstance in which it logically applies and the remaining twelve rules may only be applied with a tradition of application descending from [[Moses]] (or another authoritative legal board of the era) or all thirteen except a gezerah shava are open to all and only the latter is restricted in its application.

For example, one may make the following logical reasoning and support it using the basis of this rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. A somewhat easier construct would be to assert "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a [[Three-point field goal|three-pointer]], surely an excellent professional basketball player could make the same three-pointer," but this might be attacked as a poor analogy because not everyone can make every shot.

However, one must be careful of falling into the trap of an illogical deduction, as explained above by "dayyo". An example of this would be as follows: If a parent will punish his or her child with a minor punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child with a major punishment should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. This is an illogical deduction; although it might be a fair speculation, it cannot be proven with logic. All that can be proven is at least the result of the lesser offense. This would be akin to asserting "if a junior varsity basketball player can make a three-pointer, surely an excellent professional basketball player could make a half-court shot."

The discovery of a fallacy in the process of deduction is called "teshuvah" (objection), or, in the terminology of the [[amoraim]], "pirka". The possibility of such an objection is never wholly excluded, hence the deduction of the kal va-chomer has no absolute certainty. The consequences of this are: (a) that the conclusions have, according to many teachers, no real value in criminal procedure, a view expressed in the axiom that the conclusion is insufficient to punish the violator of an inferred prohibition (אין עונשין מן הדין ; Sifre, Num. 1); (b) that very often a passage is interpreted to mean something which may be inferred by means of a kal va-chomer (מילתא דאתיא בק"ו טרח וכתב לה קרא ; Pesahim 18b; [[Yoma]] 43a).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

An example of a situation in which transgressions are specifically not punished according to 
kal va-chomer is as follows: [[Leviticus]] 18:21 speaks of the prohibition of worshiping [[Molech]], a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume that if it were prohibited to pass some of one's children through the fire, surely it would be prohibited to pass ''all'' of one's children through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word "ומזרעך", lit. "and from your seed", that this prohibition is only when ''some'' of one's children are sacrificed in this worship; when all of one's children are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve the health and well-being of one's remaining children, whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly.

===Gezerah shavah (גזירה שוה)===
The ''gezerah shavah'' ("Similar laws, similar verdicts") is the second rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael, and the seventh of Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. This may be described as argument by [[analogy]], which infers from the similarity of two cases that the legal decision given for the one holds good for the other also. The term ''gezerah shavah'' originally included arguments based on analogies either in word or in fact. Before long, however, the latter class was designated as ''hekkesh'', while the phrase ''gezerah shavah'' was limited to analogy in the case of two different Biblical laws containing a word common to both. The ''gezerah shavah'' was originally restricted to a δὶς λεγόμενον (bis legomenon), i.e., a word occurring only in the two passages offering the analogy. Since such a word is found nowhere else, there is no reason to assume that it bears different meanings in the two passages. The ''gezerah shavah'' consequently attaches to the word in the one passage the entire sequence of ideas which it bears in the other. Such a ''gezerah shavah'' is purely lexicographical, as seeking to determine the exact signification of a word by comparison with another passage in which the full meaning of such word is clear. The rule thus demonstrates itself.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

An example will illustrate this more clearly. The phrase מלק את ראשו ("to wring off the head") occurs only twice in the [[Pentateuch]], namely, in Leviticus i. 15 and ib. v. 8. In the latter passage, however, the meaning of the phrase is more closely defined by ממול ערפו ("from the neck"). The Sifra (ed. Weiss, p.&amp;nbsp;9a) concludes, therefore, that the nearer definition, "from the neck", in the second passage, is part of the concept of the word מלק, and, consequently, that in the former passage, also, מלק means "to wring the head from the neck". At a later period, however, the gezerah shavah emerged from these narrow bounds and inferred the identity of legal requirements from the identity of their terminology, even when such terminology occurred in many passages besides the two which formed the analogy. Thereby the gezerah shavah lost its inherent power of demonstration; for it is wholly unreasonable to attribute to a word a meaning which happens to be associated with it in a single passage, when various other passages connect ideas entirely different with the same word. Since, moreover, each individual teacher might choose which two expressions he would select for a ''gezerah shavah'', contradictory conclusions might be drawn, which would each have the same claim to validity, since both were obtained by a ''gezerah shavah''. Consequently, in order to be binding, a ''gezerah shavah'' was obliged to conform to two requirements which, on the one hand, greatly restricted its application, and, on the other, gave legal decisions thus obtained the value of those deduced from a superfluous word in the Holy Scriptures.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; These conditions are:

* אין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו ("No one may draw a conclusion from analogy upon his own authority"; [[Pes.]] 66a; [[Niddah]] 19b). This rule, however, is not to be regarded as implying that every gezerah shavah must have been handed down from [[Mt. Sinai]], as [[Rashi]] (on the various passages) and many expositors who followed him explained it, but that the use of this method of hermeneutics is to be permitted only to an entire board or council, and is to be employed only when its results agree with the traditional [[halakah]], which thereby acquires the importance of a law implied in the [[Tanakh|Scriptures]]. In [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]] this rule reads: אדם דן גזירה שוה לקיים תלמודו ואין אדם דן גזירה שוה לבטל תלמודו  ("From a gezerah shavah conclusions may be deduced which support tradition, but not such as are opposed to tradition"; comp. [[Maimonides]] in the introduction to his ''Mishneh Torah'').&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
* The words of the text which form the basis of the deduction from analogy must be free, i.e., they must be superfluous and non-essential, or they may not be used (מופנה להקיש ולדין הימנו גזירה שוה). This limitation of the gezerah shavah, however, to superfluous words is not generally recognized. Akiva considers the gezerah shavah valid when neither of the two words is superfluous (אינו מופנה כלל). According to Rabbi Ishmael, it is sufficient if the analogy is free on one side (מופנה מצד אחד), i.e., if one of the two words forming the basis of the analogy is pleonastic. Rabbi Eliezer alone requires both words to be superfluous (מופנה משני צדדים; comp. [[David Zvi Hoffmann]], ''Zur Einleitung in die Halachischen Midraschim,'' p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Binyan ab mi-katuv echad (בנין אב מכתוב אחד)===
In "binyan ab mi-katub echad" ("A standard from a passage of Scripture") a certain passage serves as a basis for the interpretation of many others, so that the decision given in the case of one is valid for all the rest.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Binyan ab mi-shene ketubim (בנין אב משני כתובים)===
By this rule of "binyan ab mi-shene ketubim" ("A standard from two passages of Scripture")   a decision in two laws having a characteristic in common (הצד השוה) is applied to many other laws which have this same characteristic. Rabbi Ishmael unites rules 2 and 4 in his third rule, while the same combination forms the eighth rule of Rabbi Eliezer.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Kelal u-perat and perat u-kelal (כלל ופרט ופרט וכלל)===
The rules of "Kelal u-perat" and "perat u-kelal" ("General and particular, particular and general") is a  limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. According to Rabbi Ishmael, this principle has eight special applications, and thus includes eight separate rules in his scheme (Nos. 4-11). This method of limitation is one of the main points of difference between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the former, who follows his teacher Rabbi [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]], the particular is only an elucidation of the preceding general expression, so that the latter includes only what is contained in the particular (כלל ופרט אין בכלל אלא מה שבפרט). But if still another general follows the particular, the two general expressions are defined by the intermediate particular, so that the law applies only to what is like the particular (כלל ופרט וכלל אי אתה מרבה אלא כעין הפרט). Akiva, on the contrary, applies the rule of increase and decrease (רבוי ומיעוט) which had been taught him by his teacher Nahum of Gimzo. According to this principle, the general followed by a particular subsumes everything which is like the particular (Sanhedrin 45b, 46a). If, however, another general term follows the particular, the former subsumes also what is not similar to the latter. The two general terms are decreased in only one respect by the intermediate particular (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי ריבה הכל ומאי מיעט דבר אחר ; [[Shebu.]] 26a; comp. also [[Rashi]] on Sanhedrin l.c.).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primidi.com/talmudical_hermeneutics/detailed_rules/kelal_u-perat_and_perat_u-kelal_%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C_%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98_%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98_%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C|title=Talmudical Hermeneutics - Detailed Rules - Kelal U-perat and Perat U-kelal (כלל ופרט ופרט וכלל)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' (כלל ופרט וכלל) and ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui'' (רבוי ומיעוט ורבוי) is exemplified in the following example: [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:31 states ועשית מנרת זהב טהור מקשה תיעשה המנורה, "You shall make a ''[[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]'' of pure gold, hammered out shall the ''Menorah'' be made."  The repetitive fashion of the statement can be explained by the ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' or the ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui''.

Whichever method of deduction is employed, the word ועשית ("You shall make") is an objective generalization, the words מנרת זהב ("pure [[gold]]") are an objective specification and the word תיעשה (shall be made") is again an objective generalization.  The rule of ''kelal u-perat u-kelal'' works to teach that anything similar to the specification is deemed appropriate, while the rule of ''ribbui u-miyut u-ribbui'' is more inclusive, allowing everything ''except'' the thing ''most dissimilar'' to the specification.

Thus, [[Rashi|Rashi's]] commentary in ''[[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Rosh Hashanah]]'' 24b asserts that, according to the former method of learning this verse, the ''Menorah'' could, when necessary, be constructed of any metal (deemed in the same category of and thus similar to gold), whereas use of the latter method of learning would allow the ''Menorah'' to be constructed of anything but [[clay]] (deemed the material most dissimilar to gold).  This argument arose because the ''[[gemarah]]'' made reference to a wooden ''Menorah'' overlaid with [[tin]] that was constructed in the times of the ''[[Hasmonean|Chashmunaim]]'' and used in the Temple service.

===Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher (כיוצא בו ממקום אחר)===
The rule "Ka-yotze bo mi-makom acher" ("Like that in another place") refers to explaining a Biblical passage according to another of similar content.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===Davar ha-lamed me-inyano (דבר הלמד מעניינו)===
Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") refers to definition from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead which is not found in [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by the help of a third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, [[Simeon ben Eleazar]] laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted ([[Genesis Rabbah]] lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

To support a [[halakic]] decision, and more especially to find a point of departure in the [[aggadah]], the traditional reading of a word is altered by transposition of its consonants or by substitution of others which are related to them, or the consonant-group is retained with alteration of its vowels, the last method being the most frequent. A halakic example of this form of hermeneutics is the interpretation of the word "kapot" (bough; [[Leviticus]] 23:40) as though it were "kaput" (bound; Sifra, ed. Weiss, p.&amp;nbsp;102d; [[Sukkah (Talmud)|Sukkah]] 32a). It is noteworthy, moreover, that only the tannaim derived new halakot with the aid of these rules, while the [[amoraim]] employed them only in advancing haggadic explanations or in establishing the old halakhot of the Tannaim.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Talmud Hermeneutics|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14215-talmud-hermeneutics|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Bacher|authorlink1=Wilhelm Bacher|first2=Jacob Zallel|last2=Lauterbach|authorlink2=Jacob Zallel Lauterbach|accessdate=Mar 1, 2016}}

'''Tandem language learning''' is a method of [[language learning]] based on mutual [[language exchange]] between tandem partners (ideally each learner is a native speaker in the language the proponent wants to learn). Many [[language school]]s in the world, organised as TANDEM International,&lt;ref name="tandem-schools1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandem-schools.com|title=Tandem International e.V., the Tandem schools group|last=|first=|date=|website=tandem-schools.com|accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many universities implement this approach.

==General background==
In Tandem Language Learning both partners can meet in person (face-to-face Tandem) or learn by e-mail, phone or other media (eTandem, also called Distance Tandem), placing emphasis on cultural integration as part of the language-learning process. Learning is supported in different ways, for instance, via worksheets, textbooks or simply informal conversation. There are distinct uses of the Tandem method which promote independent learning e.g. Tandem Partnerships (two people, supported by counsellors), and Binational Tandem Courses (for groups, organised by moderators). The classic style is that where partners equally share the available time during the exchange. For example, a Portuguese speaker and a German speaker can talk for half an hour in German and then for half an hour in Portuguese. In this way, through language exchange partnerships with native speakers, and extra social and cultural experiences, participants become fully immersed in the target language culture. The only condition for participation in self-directed Tandem is to be at a lower intermediate  level of language proficiency (Lower B1 Threshold). The Common European Framework of References for Languages ( CEFR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/cadre1_en.asp |title=Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment (CEFR) |website=Coe.int |date=2014-03-29 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Can-Do statements provide a clear description of language ability at the Threshold level (B1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eur.nl/english/ltc/alumni/cefr/b1/ |title=CEFR level B1 (Intermediate) |website=Eur.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in several European languages.

==Tandem history==
"Language learning by exchange" or the Tandem Approach is based on various systems of teaching exchange students abroad, such as: partner learning, "peer teaching", tutoring models and "Zweierschaften" (Steinig) or  'one-on-one discipleship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguee.com/german-english/translation/zweierschaft.html |title=zweierschaft - English translation – Linguee |website=Linguee.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some of the most important highlights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = TANDEM Fundazioa: history|url = http://tandemcity.info/general/en_history.htm|website = tandemcity.info|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=1CpgcAZWT5UC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=history+tandem+schmelter#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title = Schmelter, Selbstgesteuertes oder potenziell expansives Fremdsprachenlernen im Tandem, Gunter Narr Verlag Tübingen|date=2004|pages=134–149|accessdate =2016-01-20 |website =Books.google.es|isbn = 9783823361039|last1 = Schmelter|first1 = Lars}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the beginning of the 19th century in England, [[Joseph Lancaster]] and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] instituted the "mutual system" which supplemented large parts of the teacher’s activity at school with pupils’ mutual help. Peter Petersen (German educationalist, 1884–1952) developed something similar in the "[[Jenaplan schools]]", and, from 1960 on, similar tutoring models began to appear in the USA.
* The "Tandem" concept for two people learning the same language appeared first in 1971 in connection with the "audio-visual method" of Wambach, and from there it was transferred to binational German-French youth meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfjw.org/english-version |title=Service &gt; The Franco-German Youth Office (FGYO) &amp;#124; Deutsch-Französisches Jugendwerk |language=de |website=Dfjw.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Klaus Lieb-Harkort and Nükhet Cimilli transferred the model to their work with immigrants in the German-Turkish area, in Munich. Courses followed in Bremen, Frankfurt and Zürich.
* In 1979, this inspired Jürgen Wolff to develop the Tandem learning partner mediation, initially for Spanish and German. In 1982 a similar course programme designed by Wolff and his colleagues in Madrid later became the basis for the TANDEM network, later established as the TANDEM schools network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tandem-schools.com/network/ |title=TANDEM: Network |website=tandem-schools.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 1983, the TANDEM model is adopted as an alternative way of language learning, whose basic elements of language courses abroad, youth exchange, cultural tours, class correspondence and similar cross-border activities are replicated in selective schools throughout Europe. 
* The network cooperates with various educational institutions including the E-Tandem Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slf.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ |title=Tandem Server Bochum - language learning exchange partnerships - eTandem |website=Slf.ruhr-uni-bochum.de |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1992, and renamed the International E-Mail Tandem Network in 1993.
* 'TANDEM Fundazioa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandemcity.info/general/en_history.htm |title=TANDEM Fundazioa: history |website=Tandemcity.info |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1994 for the development of scientific cooperation and educational and advanced training with their head office in Donostia/San Sebastian, Spain.
* The majority of the schools under the TANDEM Network established the association 'TANDEM International'&lt;ref name="tandem-schools1"/&gt; with headquarters in Bremen, Germany. Since March 2014, TANDEM International has been the owner of the brand 'TANDEM'.

==Opportunities for application==
Tandem is an approach that can benefit all ages, which can be implemented in different educational settings, but perhaps is best appreciated by language students with a lower intermediate proficiency or above. It can take place in the country of one course group, in the country of the other group, together in a third location, or over the Internet.

Tandem unites many aims under one roof:
* general language Tandem,
* Tandem focused on cultural exchange,
* Tandem for professional purposes,
* cross-cultural understanding Tandem,
* multilingual ‘Babylonia Tandem’,
* cross-border 'Mugaz Gain'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandemcity.info/euskara/ca24_mugaz-gain.htm |title=TANDEM Fundazioa: Mugaz Gain proyecto cultural transfronterizo |website=Tandemcity.info |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* eTandem on the Internet
&lt;br&gt;
And offers self-directed learning with flexibility of content: conversation, narrative, reading, professional activities such as phone calls, interpretation, translation, as well as leisure activities, intercultural differences, etc. Tandem has developed from a language-learning method to an educational movement, as evidenced by the sources cited.

==Positive effects==
'''Improvement in language skills'''

At first, professional discussion primarily centred round the question of the effectiveness of Tandem in comparison with traditional language teaching methodologies. This initiated an investigation carried out in 1983 at the Madrid Goethe-Institute, in which Tandem pairs, a Tandem course and teacher-steered phases were connected with each other and the linguistic progress was compared to a control group, who were also preparing for the '[[TestDaF-Institut|Zertifikat DaF]]'. Results showed that the Tandem participants got better results in listening comprehension and speaking skills while they were less successful in reading and writing, even if their performance in the certificate as a whole was just as good as the control group. Another advantage was mutual mistake correction, which was fostered by increased language intake.

'''Development of intercultural competence'''

Not only is Tandem concerned with language comprehension and learning, but equally with cultural understanding and knowledge. Accordingly, a critical analysis of its competence must also examine this second ‘leg’. In fact, it turns out that Tandem aids a change of perspective, with comparison of one’s own and foreign points of view. This is also very helpful during translator training. Moreover, native speakers report an increase of awareness about their own language in the course of the Tandem. Therefore, it seems to be suitable as a ‘confidence booster’ in learning contexts.

== Getting started with Tandem learning ==
'''Considerations for 121 Tandem'''

With regard to the requirements and quality of the input, it is essential to give the following basic tools during the practical introduction to Tandem:
• [[meta-communication]] formulas in the foreign language, for the learner's role, and

• the most important explanation techniques in the first language, for the learning assistant's role.

'''Considerations for Group Tandem'''

Mediation with large numbers of participants, "cocktail mediation", in which many people form partnerships after an introduction to Tandem, has proved as effective as mediation via questionnaires and images. It can be recommended as a good way of finding learning partners, on the condition that for the remaining students the possibility of questionnaire mediation be made known before starting.

'''Criteria for ‘good’ Tandems'''

In another investigation, Tandem partners in Bolzano and Merano who had been learning for more than one year together, and can be seen accordingly as experts, were questioned about their experiences in order to infer criteria for ‘good’ Tandems. The results showed (in order of frequency, multiple answers possible):
* human understanding/sympathy
* common interests
* time availability
* punctuality/reliability
* consistency
* common aims
* initial support at the beginning of the experience
Several series of tandem handbooks have been published in many languages as a result of the [[European Union]] funded projects: Tandem and eTandem Handbooks and Teacher Guides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slf.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/Tandem/etandem/guides-en.html |title=eTandem Europa - Tandem handbooks and teacher guides - English |website=Slf.ruhr-uni-bochum.de |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[LINGUA]] project "International E-Mail Tandem Network" (1994–1996)
*[[Open and Distance Learning]] project "Telematics for Autonomous and Intercultural Tandem Learning" (1996–1999).
*[[LINGUA-D]] project "Tandem Language Learning Partnerships for Schools" (1998–2000)

== From tandem language learning to telecollaboration ==
In order to compete in our digitally advanced world, the acquisition of 21st Century skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Liberty Concepts |url=http://edglossary.org/21st-century-skills/ |title=21st Century Skills Definition - The Glossary of Education Reform |website=Edglossary.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Global skills has taken priority in the classroom. And as can be seen from its history, Tandem Language Learning has metamorphosed over time, reflecting these changes in our attitudes to learning. Today, with a focus on [[intercultural competence]], a key global skill, Tandem Language Learning has been also called Online Intercultural Exchange (OIE) (O'Dowd, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Online intercultural exchange: An introduction for foreign language teachers.|last = O'Dowd|first = R.|publisher = Clevedon: Multilingual Matters.|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-mediated Intercultural Foreign Language Education (ICFLE) and Telecollaboration. Such exchanges, despite being held at distance, give participants access to different cultures and beliefs with an authentic audience, boosting student engagement.

'''Benefits of virtual language exchanges'''

Indeed, benefits of virtual exchanges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fltmag.com/virtual-exchanges-in-the-foreign-language-classroom/ |title=Virtual Exchanges in the Foreign Language Classroom |publisher=The Fltmag |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are seen to include
* development of intercultural competence 
* improvement of foreign language skills to communicate with native speakers
* increase in student motivation
* student-centred learning
'''Drawbacks of Virtual Language Exchanges''' 
* possible lack of accessibility due to time difference
* communication gaps due to social and cultural differences and expectations between groups. 
* this, in turn, may have a negative effect on motivation.

'''Getting Started with Telecollaboration'''

These virtual platforms allow easily observable and assessable student activity, and may provide access to virtual partnerships. One example is that of the Skype in the Classroom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skypeintheclassroom.org/ |title=Microsoft in Education |publisher=Skype in the Classroom |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307161907/http://skypeintheclassroom.org/ |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; part of [[Skype]], an online telephony platform. It hosts a ready-made activity called Mystery Skype, where classes have to guess where in the world their exchange-class is based. This is a simple, easily adaptable task that could be easily integrated into normal classroom activity.

'''Intercultural Communicative Competence in Telecollaboration and Tandem'''

Telecollaboration enables the augmentation of cultural awareness and [[second-language acquisition]] by geographically distant individuals using [[computer-mediated communication]] tools.  A key objective of this exchange process is the development of [[Intercultural competence|Intercultural Communicative Competence]] (ICC) (O’Dowd, 2013&lt;ref name="O'Dowd2013" /&gt;), given that  previous research (see for example see Kern, 2000;&lt;ref name="KernR2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kern|first1=R.|title=Literacy and language teaching|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer, 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=G.|title=E-mail) in foreign language teaching. Towards the creation of virtual classrooms.|date=1998|publisher=Stauffenberg medien|location=Tubingen, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has established that exposure to  different cultures via online communication may have bolstered perceptions of difference by reinforcing [[stereotype]]s, as opposed to facilitating deeper cultural awareness and understanding between participants in the online exchange. Moreover, Helm and Guth (2010)&lt;ref name=HelmGuth2010&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helm, F.|author2=Guth, S.|editor1-last=Francesca Helm|editor1-first=Sarah Guth|title=Telecollaboration 2.0: Language, Literacies, and Intercultural Learning in the 21st Century|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Bern|chapter=The Multifarious Goals of Telecollaboration 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold that Telecollaboration is based in a globalised milieu where the ideas of culture and language may not be consistent with those of [[national identity]]; identity may derive from historical and geographical processes within a multicultural context that extends beyond national boundaries (Risager, 2007 cited in Helm and Guth, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;ref name=HelmGuth2010 /&gt;). This shift highlights the importance of facilitating an awareness of [[cultural diversity]], in terms of how learners perceive their own and other cultures. Based on this research, fostering ICC is essential given today’s cultural diversity in education (Helm and Guth, 2010;&lt;ref name=HelmGuth2010 /&gt; O’Dowd and Waire, 2009&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Dowd|first1=R.|last2=Waire|first2=P.|title=Critical issues in telecollaborative task design|journal=Computer Assisted Language Learning|date=2009|volume=22|issue=2|pages=173–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Further, with the proliferation of [[Web 2.0]] (and indeed Telecollaboration 2.0) students are increasingly immersed in situations where an awareness about their own and other cultures is essential to developing  communicative competence in a culturally-diverse setting. The key to the development of these competencies is collaboration within the wide array of communicative task-based activities used in Telecollaboration(O’Dowd, 2013&lt;ref name="O'Dowd2013" /&gt;).

'''Telecollaboration Using [[Task-based learning|Task-based Learning]]: Challenges for Instructors'''

There are several challenges inherent in instructors’ choices of appropriate tasks in fostering ICC within Telecollaboration. Firstly, research has indicated that while instructors may be able to implement tasks aimed at fostering ICC, they may not be able to clearly conceptualize the intended outcome of the chosen tasks (Samuda and Bygate, 2008, cited in O’Dowd &amp; Waire, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;174&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt;). Secondly, collaboration between tandem instructors may create challenges in respect of differing views on task design, especially in relation to [[learner autonomy]], that is, how much autonomy students should be given in choosing and completing tasks (O’Dowd &amp; Waire, 2009&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt;). Thirdly, instructors’ differing views on their role in terms of intervention and management of the task may affect the task outcome (O’Dowd and Waire, 2009&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt;) as well as result in lengthy, time-consuming online exchange.

'''Fostering ICC within Telecollaboration Using Task-based Learning: Task Types'''

Research conducted by O’Dowd and Waire (2009)&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt; highlighted 12 task types that could foster the development of such non-linguistic pedagogical objectives. These task types fall within 3 categories:
# Tasks designed to foster Information Exchange mainly used at the introduction stage, where students interact via the exchange of basic personal information. This may be conducted by providing cultural autobiographies, virtual interviews and informal conversation.  
# Comparison and Analysis tasks are more demanding as they go beyond information exchange and require participants to compare and critically analyze [[Cultural artifact|cultural artefacts]] from their respective cultures, such as [[book]]s, [[newspaper article]]s, and [[film]]s. Furthermore, ICC may also be fostered through the use of [[questionnaire]]s designed to elicit discussion regarding different perceptions of [[Word Association|word associations]] and social situations (Furstenburg et al., 2001, cited in O’Dowd and Waire, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt;), creating a context for virtual discussion on these matters.
# Collaborative tasks are aimed at the co-production, i.e. the creation of a joint artefact, in the form of an [[essay]], [[presentation]], [[translation]] or cultural adaptation of a text. This type of activity is designed to engender a context in which participants actively negotiate meaning linguistically and culturally, and reach an agreement on their final co-production arising from their collaboration (O’Dowd and Waire, 2009&lt;ref name="O'DowdWaire2009" /&gt;).

== Tandem learning using the Cormier Method ==
According to Chang &amp; Kuo (2009) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning culture and language through ICTs : methods for enhanced instruction|date=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|others=Chang, Maiga, 1974-, Kuo, Chen-Wo.|isbn=9781605661667|location=Hershey PA|oclc=430984238}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cormier method is based on instructions in which small groups of learners with different mother tongues interact for in-tandem learning to occur. Devised by Helene Cormier, a language teacher at Club d'échange linguistique de Montréal language school (CELM), the participants develop conversations that are aimed to consolidate developed skills in the areas of listening, comprehension, vocabulary and pronunciation.

Participants of this language exchange can experience how native speakers interact through text, voice and video chat. The sessions take about roughly one hour, in which the participants speak in one language for thirty minutes and then switch to the other language for the following thirty minutes. Additionally, through this experience the learners have the chance to learn something from their peers’ culture by using the target language accordingly. &amp;nbsp;

In Mullaiselvan Mohan’s (2016) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/mullais/Home/misc/cormier-method|title=Cormier method - mullais|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google site, there are five recommendations that should be taken into account in order to develop sessions with the Cormier method.

These include:
* Utilising the timer accordingly
* Taking charge of your own learning when speaking in your second language
* Being sensitive to your partners' needs when speaking in your own language
* Not correcting grammar all the time, but striving for communication
* Being considerate to others
Abdulezer et al (2007) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skype for dummies|last=Loren.|first=Abdulezer,|date=2007|publisher=Wiley Pub|others=Abdulezer, Susan., Dammond, Howard., Zennström, Niklas.|isbn=978-0470048917|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=85838113}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the Cormier method is implemented in mylanguageexchange.com, a formal language-learning site, which recommends the implementation of Skype since it is free, mobile and easy to install in most electronic devices that possess a webcam and a microphone. Through the use of Skype audio conferencing learners are able to formulate small groups and use the built-in timer in Skype to maintain the rotation of languages.

Advantages:
* Small focused groups allow all participants to practise and develop close relationships
* Pre-designed lesson plans and engaging activities stimulate participants’ motivation
* Real-time communication with native speakers of your target language is arguably more beneficial than any textbook or pre-recorded media
* Can be accessed anywhere with an adequate internet connection
* Virtual timer manages and allocates time for each participate to practice
Disadvantages:
* Only suitable for intermediate and above levels
* Native speakers may struggle to assist learners’ if they have no teaching background
* Learners from different educational backgrounds and knowledge may hinder communication
* Accessibility in certain countries
* Practice vs Progression &amp;nbsp;
As this method is primarily for practising, it should not be the main source of language learning and should be seen as a review or a tool that helps learners improve their language learning skills.

Cormier’s method is a simple approach to e-tandem learning that has clearly had success, particularly with the use of Skype. Implementing such a method is possible with relative ease, but there are drawbacks as previously discussed. However, with an abundance of new technologies emerging, different and improved approaches to that of Cormier may have even greater success in the future. These tools could be utilised to incorporate language-learning beginners, as well as improve upon the accessibility to learners in countries where Skype may not be available. Alternative digital tools such as Google Hangouts, Viber, ooVoo, WeChat and many more means that e-tandem learning and telecollaboration will be an area of language learning that continues to grow and prosper.

== Why tandem language learning does not always work ==

Tandem language learning is in theory a great idea that reaps various linguistic and cultural benefits. Students of different nationalities can learn from each other for free. However, there are various reasons that may not allow this to work (Drummer, 2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://agnieszkadrummer.wordpress.com/2012/11/02/dlaczego-tandemy-jezykowe-czesto-nie-dzialaja/|title=Dlaczego tandemy językowe często "nie działają"?|last=Drummer|first=A|date=2012|work=Agnieszka Drummer - język niemiecki|access-date=2018-02-14|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lack of sufficient amount of foreign students who wish to study a particular minority language''' (such as Polish, Maltese and others). Even if speakers of minority languages want to learn more popular ones such as English or German, they may find difficulty to find others who are interested in theirs. Minority languages are not very attractive in the world market of [[foreign language]]s (Drummer, 2012)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Participants´expertise:''' this may involve two factors:

# Insufficient knowledge: Native speakers may lack sufficient knowledge to teach their own language to others. It may also be very challenging and time consuming for students to be methodologically and pedagogically apt to design meaningful learning experiences (Drummer, 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Error correction: According to Py (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Py|first=B|date=2000|title=La construction interactive de la norm comme pratique et come representation|url=|journal=Aile|volume=12|pages=77–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as cited in Cappellini (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappellini|first=M|date=2016|title=Roles and Scaffolding in Teletandem Interactions: A Study of the Relations between the Sociocultural and the Language Learning Dimensions in a French-Chinese Teletandem|doi=10.1080/17501229.2016.1134859|journal=Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching|volume=10 |issue=1|pages=6–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; novice learners speaking in a foreign language during tandem programmes may make mistakes which provoke interruptions from the language experts that aim to correct the error. Such interruptions may hinder the flow of the conversation, disturb the fluency of the novice speaker and produce further foreign language anxieties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idyoma.com/blog/2018/7/17/best-way-to-learn-spanish|title=The Best Way to Learn Spanish: A Process That Works for You|work=Idyoma|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

* '''Task design''': &amp;nbsp;If the online language interaction lacks proper integration within the learning process and the course curriculum, displays no pedagogical leadership and has carelessly designed tasks, the value of tandem language learning can be downplayed by both students and teachers alike (O´Dowd, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, R. (2013). Telecollaboration and CALL. In Thomas, M., Reinders, H., &amp; Warshauer, M. (Eds.) ''Contemporary computer-assisted language learning''. London: Bloomsbury Academic. pp. 123-140. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://site.ebrary.com/lib/uon/detail.action?docID=10632566&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;
* '''Affordances of technology:''' Technology can sometimes come in the way of successful online intercultural exchanges. Lewis (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T. (2017). Introduction to system special issue on telecollaboration. ''System,'' ''64'', 1-6. doi:10.1016/j.system.2017.01.007&lt;/ref&gt; argues that there may be a non - alignment of visual input and output when using certain conferencing technologies such as [[Skype]]. Consequently, &amp;nbsp;students will appear to be socially absent from the conversation which will bring about miscommunication. Moreover, the affordances of [[Teleconference|teleconferencing]] can undermine actual communication by interrupting the usual process of indicating social presence that includes looking directly at the interlocutor. Hence, if students by mistake signal themselves as socially absent from the other teleconference participants, it can contribute to their exclusion from the conversation.
* '''Cultural issues:''' Telles (2015)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telles|first=João Antonio|last2=Telles|first2=João Antonio|date=March 2015|title=Teletandem and performativity|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1984-63982015000100001&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Brasileira de Linguística Aplicada|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–30|doi=10.1590/1984-639820155536|issn=1984-6398}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that during tandem programmes when comparing cultures, students may share their subjective opinions and reinforce intercultural [[stereotype]]s that may create a hostile discourse and interrupt the flow of the conversations. &amp;nbsp;To this end, he suggests that without teacher interventions tele tandem interactions “may fall into shallow performances of sedimented and pre-given representations of self and other” (Telles, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This tallies with O’ Dowd (2013)’s&lt;ref name="O'Dowd2013" /&gt; views who sustains that preconceptions of the other learner's culture can affect learners’ proactive attitudes and levels of participation in the exchange (O´Dowd, 2015 as cited in O´Dowd, 2013).&lt;ref name="O'Dowd2013" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

To conclude, in theory, language tandem is a great idea and at times it may be beneficial. However, it requires a mutual effort from both parties, time and synchronization. If one of the parties is not satisfied with the learning experience, the tandem language experience may not be a successful educational endeavour (Drummer, 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

'''Theoretical computer science''' ('''TCS''') is a subset of general [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]] that focuses on more mathematical topics 
of computing and includes the [[theory of computation]].

It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[ACM SIGACT|Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory]] (SIGACT) provides the following description:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  SIGACT | url = https://www.sigact.org/ | accessdate = 2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"|TCS covers a wide variety of topics including [[algorithms]], [[data structure]]s, [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[parallel computation|parallel]] and [[distributed computation|distributed]] computation, [[probabilistic computation]], [[quantum computation]], [[automata theory]], [[information theory]], [[cryptography]], [[program semantics]] and [[Formal methods|verification]], [[machine learning]], [[computational biology]], [[computational economics]], [[computational geometry]], and [[computational number theory]] and [[Symbolic computation|algebra]]. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and [[rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigor]].}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of computer science}}

While logical it is inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 [[Kurt Gödel]] proved with his [[incompleteness theorem]] that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.

These developments have led to the modern study of logic and [[computability]], and indeed the field of theoretical computer science as a whole{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. [[Information theory]] was added to the field{{by whom|date=September 2017}} with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by [[Claude Shannon]]. In the same decade, [[Donald Hebb]] introduced a mathematical model of [[Hebbian learning|learning]] in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of [[neural network]]s and [[parallel distributed processing]] were established. In 1971, [[Stephen Cook]] and, working independently, [[Leonid Levin]], proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]] &amp;ndash; a landmark result in [[computational complexity theory]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

With the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the beginning of the 20th century came the concept that mathematical operations could be performed on an entire particle wavefunction. In other words, one could compute functions on multiple states simultaneously. This led to the concept of a [[quantum computer]] in the latter half of the 20th century that took off in the 1990s when [[Peter Shor]] showed that such methods could be used to factor large numbers in [[polynomial time]], which, if implemented, would render most modern [[public key cryptography]] systems uselessly insecure.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Modern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:

===Algorithms===
{{main|Algorithm}}
An [[algorithm]] is a step-by-step procedure for calculations.  Algorithms are used for [[calculation]], [[data processing]], and [[automated reasoning]].

An algorithm is an [[effective method]] expressed as a [[wikt:finite|finite]] list&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; of well-defined instructions&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[null string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data structures===
{{main|Data structure}}
A [[data structure]] is a particular way of organizing [[data (computing)|data]] in a computer so that it can be used [[algorithmic efficiency|efficiently]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Black (ed.), entry for ''data structure'' in ''[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]]. U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. 15 December 2004. [http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/datastructur.html Online version] Accessed May 21, 2009.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry ''data structure'' in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (2009) [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152190/data-structure Online entry] accessed on May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, databases use [[B-tree]] indexes for small percentages of data retrieval and [[compiler]]s and databases use dynamic [[hash table]]s as look up tables.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large [[database]]s and [[web indexing|internet indexing services]]. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient [[algorithm]]s. Some formal design methods and [[programming language]]s emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Storing and retrieving can be carried out on data stored in both [[main memory]] and in [[secondary memory]].

===Computational complexity theory===
{{main|Computational complexity theory}}
[[Computational complexity theory]] is a branch of the [[theory of computation]] that focuses on classifying [[computational problems]] according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those [[Complexity class|classes]] to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an [[algorithm]].

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the [[algorithm]] used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other [[complexity]] measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what [[computer]]s can and cannot do.

===Distributed computation===
{{main|Distributed computation}}
[[Distributed computing]] studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located on [[computer network|networked computers]] communicate and coordinate their actions by [[message passing|passing messages]].&lt;ref name="Coulouris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulouris|first=George|author2=Jean Dollimore|author3=Tim Kindberg|author4=Gordon Blair|title=Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (5th Edition)|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2011|location=Boston|isbn=0-132-14301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.&lt;ref name="Coulouris"/&gt; Examples of distributed systems vary from [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA-based systems]] to [[massively multiplayer online game]]s to [[Peer-to-peer| peer-to-peer applications]].

A [[computer program]] that runs in a distributed system is called a '''distributed program''', and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many alternatives for the message passing mechanism, including [[Remote procedure call|RPC-like]] connectors and [[Message-oriented middleware|message queues]].  An important goal and challenge of distributed systems is [[location transparency]].

===Parallel computation===
{{main|Parallel computation}}
[[Parallel computing]] is a form of [[computing|computation]] in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Allan|title=Highly parallel computing|year=1989|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|location=Redwood City, Calif.|isbn=0-8053-0177-1|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|author2=Almasi, George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved [[Parallelism (computing)|"in parallel"]]. There are several different forms of parallel computing: [[bit-level parallelism|bit-level]], [[instruction level parallelism|instruction level]], [[data parallelism|data]], and [[task parallelism]]. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in [[high performance computing|high-performance computing]], but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing [[frequency scaling]].&lt;ref&gt;S.V. Adve et al. (November 2008). [http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/documents/UPCRC_Whitepaper.pdf "Parallel Computing Research at Illinois: The UPCRC Agenda"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209154000/http://www.upcrc.illinois.edu/documents/UPCRC_Whitepaper.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }} (PDF). Parallel@Illinois, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "The main techniques for these performance benefits&amp;nbsp;– increased clock frequency and smarter but increasingly complex architectures&amp;nbsp;– are now hitting the so-called power wall. The computer industry has accepted that future performance increases must largely come from increasing the number of processors (or cores) on a die, rather than making a single core go faster."&lt;/ref&gt; As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;Asanovic et al. Old [conventional wisdom]: Power is free, but transistors are expensive. New [conventional wisdom] is [that] power is expensive, but transistors are "free".&lt;/ref&gt; parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in [[computer architecture]], mainly in the form of [[multi-core processor]]s.&lt;ref name="View-Power"&gt;Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006). [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf "The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley"] (PDF). University of California, Berkeley. Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2006-183. "Old [conventional wisdom]: Increasing clock frequency is the primary method of improving processor performance. New [conventional wisdom]: Increasing parallelism is the primary method of improving processor performance&amp;nbsp;... Even representatives from Intel, a company generally associated with the 'higher clock-speed is better' position, warned that traditional approaches to maximizing performance through maximizing clock speed have been pushed to their limit."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parallel algorithm|Parallel computer programs]] are more difficult to write than sequential ones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hennessy|first=John L.|title=Computer organization and design : the hardware/software interface|year=1999|publisher=Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-55860-428-6|edition=2. ed., 3rd print.|author2=Patterson, David A. |author3=Larus, James R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential [[software bug]]s, of which [[race condition]]s are the most common. [[Computer networking|Communication]] and [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

The maximum possible [[speedup|speed-up]] of a single program as a result of parallelization is known as [[Amdahl's law]].

===Very-large-scale integration===
{{main|VLSI}}
[[Very-large-scale integration]] ('''VLSI''') is the process of creating an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) by combining thousands of [[transistors]] into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex [[semiconductor]] and [[communication]] technologies were being developed. The [[microprocessor]] is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An [[electronic circuit]] might consist of a [[central processing unit|CPU]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] and other [[glue logic]]. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.

===Machine learning===
{{main|Machine learning}}
[[Machine learning]] is a [[academic disciplines|scientific discipline]] that deals with the construction and study of [[algorithm]]s that can [[learning|learn]] from data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glossary of terms |author1=Ron Kovahi |author2=Foster Provost |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=30 |pages=271–274 |year=1998 |url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/glossary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such algorithms operate by building a [[Statistical model|model]] based on inputs&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite book |author=C. M. Bishop |authorlink=Christopher M. Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-31073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.

Machine learning can be considered a subfield of computer science and [[statistics]]. It has strong ties to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[mathematical optimization|optimization]], which deliver methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit, rule-based [[algorithm]]s is infeasible. Example applications include [[spam filter]]ing, [[optical character recognition]] (OCR),&lt;ref name=Wernick-Signal-Proc-July-2010&gt;Wernick, Yang, Brankov, Yourganov and Strother, Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, ''[[IEEE Signal Processing Society|IEEE Signal Processing Magazine]]'', vol. 27, no. 4, July 2010, pp. 25-38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning to rank|search engines]] and [[computer vision]]. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with [[data mining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mannila |first=Heikki |title=Data mining: machine learning, statistics, and databases |conference=Int'l Conf. Scientific and Statistical Database Management |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that focuses more on exploratory data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Jerome H. |authorlink=Jerome H. Friedman |title=Data Mining and Statistics: What's the connection? |journal=Computing Science and Statistics |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning and [[pattern recognition]] "can be viewed as two facets of
the same field."&lt;ref name="bishop"/&gt;{{rp|vii}}

===Computational biology===
{{main|Computational biology}}
[[Computational biology]] involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in computer science, [[applied mathematics]], [[animation]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[genomics]], [[ecology]], [[evolution]], [[anatomy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[scientific visualization|visualization]].&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational biology is different from [[biological computation]], which is a subfield of computer science and [[computer engineering]] using [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, but is similar to [[bioinformatics]], which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.

===Computational geometry===
{{main|Computational geometry}}
[[Computational geometry]] is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms that can be stated in terms of [[geometry]]. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with history stretching back to antiquity. An ancient precursor is the [[Sanskrit]] treatise [[Shulba Sutras]], or "Rules of the Chord", that is a book of algorithms written in 800 BCE. The book prescribes step-by-step procedures for constructing geometric objects like altars using a peg and chord.

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in [[computer graphics]] and computer-aided design and manufacturing ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from [[mathematical visualization]].

Other important applications of computational geometry include [[robotics]] (motion planning and visibility problems), [[geographic information system]]s (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), [[integrated circuit]] design (IC geometry design and verification), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) (mesh generation), [[computer vision]] (3D reconstruction).

===Information theory===
{{main|Information theory}}
[[Information theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[computer science]] involving the [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of [[information]].  Information theory was developed by [[Claude E. Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as [[data compression|compressing data]] and on reliably [[Computer data storage|storing]] and [[Telecommunication|communicating]] data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including [[statistical inference]], [[natural language processing]], [[cryptography]], [[neurobiology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F.

Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include [[lossless data compression]] (e.g. [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP files]]), [[lossy data compression]] (e.g. [[MP3]]s and [[JPEG]]s), and [[channel capacity|channel coding]] (e.g. for [[DSL|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)]]).  The field is at the intersection of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[neurobiology]], and [[electrical engineering]]. Its impact has been crucial to the success of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the [[Internet]], the study of [[linguistics]] and of human perception, the understanding of [[black hole]]s, and numerous other fields. Important sub-fields of information theory are [[source coding]], [[channel coding]], [[algorithmic complexity theory]], [[algorithmic information theory]], [[information-theoretic security]], and measures of information.

===Cryptography===
{{main|Cryptography}}
[[Cryptography]]  is the practice and study of techniques for [[secure communication]] in the presence of third parties (called [[adversary (cryptography)|adversaries]]).&lt;ref name="rivest90"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ron Rivest|editor=J. Van Leeuwen|title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science|chapter=Cryptology|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing [[communications protocol|protocol]]s that overcome the influence of adversaries&lt;ref name="modern-crypto"&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Mihir|last1=Bellare|first2=Phillip|last2=Rogaway|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|chapter=Introduction|page=10|date=21 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that are related to various aspects in [[information security]] such as data [[confidentiality]], [[data integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]].&lt;ref name="hac"&gt;{{cite book |first=A.

Applications of cryptography include [[automated teller machine|ATM cards]], [[password|computer passwords]], and [[electronic commerce]].

Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around [[computational hardness assumption]]s, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in [[integer factorization]] algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist [[Information theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] schemes that {{not a typo|provably}} cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the [[one-time pad]]—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

===Quantum computation===
{{main|Quantum computation}}
A [[quantum computer]] is a [[computation]] system that makes direct use of [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] [[phenomena]], such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], to perform [[Instruction (computer science)|operations]] on [[data]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cba.mit.edu/docs/papers/98.06.sciqc.pdf Quantum Computing with Molecules]" article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' by [[Neil Gershenfeld]] and [[Isaac L. Chuang]]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on [[transistor]]s. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits ([[bit]]s), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses [[qubits]] (quantum bits), which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. A theoretical model is the [[quantum Turing machine]], also known as the universal quantum computer.  Quantum computers share theoretical similarities with [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] and [[probabilistic automaton|probabilistic computers]]; one example is the ability to be in more than one state simultaneously.  The field of quantum computing was first introduced by [[Yuri Manin]] in 1980&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu.

{{as of|2014}}, quantum computing is still in its infancy but experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-01-qubit-bodes-future-quantum.html|title=New qubit control bodes well for future of quantum computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum [[computer]]s for both civilian and national security purposes, such as [[cryptanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://qist.lanl.gov/qcomp_map.shtml Quantum Information Science and Technology Roadmap] for a sense of where the research is heading.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information-based complexity===
{{main|Information-based complexity}}
Information-based complexity (IBC) studies optimal algorithms and computational complexity for continuous problems. IBC has studied continuous problems as path integration, partial differential equations, systems of ordinary differential equations, nonlinear equations, integral equations, fixed points, and very-high-dimensional integration.

===Computational number theory===
{{main|Computational number theory}}
[[Computational number theory]], also known as '''algorithmic number theory''', is the study of [[algorithm]]s for performing [[number theory|number theoretic]] [[computation]]s. The best known problem in the field is [[integer factorization]].

===Symbolic computation===
{{main|Symbolic computation}}
[[Computer algebra]], also called symbolic computation or algebraic computation is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for manipulating [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]] and other [[mathematical object]]s. Although, properly speaking, computer algebra should be a subfield of [[scientific computing]], they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on [[numerical computation]] with approximate [[floating point number]]s, while symbolic computation emphasizes ''exact'' computation with expressions containing [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s that have not any given value and are thus manipulated as symbols (therefore the name of ''symbolic computation'').

[[Software]] applications that perform symbolic calculations are called ''[[computer algebra system]]s'', with the term ''system'' alluding to the complexity of the main applications  that include, at least, a method to represent mathematical data in a computer, a user programming language (usually different from the language used for the implementation), a dedicated memory manager, a [[user interface]] for the input/output of mathematical expressions, a large set of [[function (computer science)|routines]] to perform usual operations, like simplification of expressions, [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] using [[chain rule]], [[polynomial factorization]], [[indefinite integration]], etc.

===Program semantics===
{{main|Program semantics}}
In [[programming language theory]], '''semantics''' is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [[programming language]]s. It does so by evaluating the meaning of [[programming language syntax|syntactically]] legal [[String (computer science)|strings]] defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will execute on a certain [[computer platform|platform]], hence creating a [[model of computation]].

===Formal methods===
{{main|Formal methods}}
[[Formal methods]] are a particular kind of [[mathematics]] based techniques for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite web|author=R. W. Butler|title=What is Formal Methods?|url=http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/fm-what.html|date=2001-08-06|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Michael Holloway|title=Why Engineers Should Consider Formal Methods|url=http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/holloway/nasa-97-16dasc-cmh.pdf|publisher=16th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (27–30 October 1997)|accessdate=2006-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116210448/http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/holloway/nasa-97-16dasc-cmh.pdf|archivedate=16 November 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Monin, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automata theory===
{{main|Automata theory}}
[[Automata theory]] is the study of ''[[abstract machine]]s'' and ''[[automaton|automata]]'', as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under [[Discrete mathematics]] (a section of [[Mathematics]] and also of [[Computer Science]]). ''Automata'' comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning "self-acting".

Automata Theory is the study of self-operating virtual machines to help in logical understanding of input and output process, without or with intermediate stage(s) of [[computation]] (or any [[Function (engineering)|function]] / process).

===Coding theory===
{{main|Coding theory}}
[[Coding theory]] is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error-correction]] and more recently also for [[network coding]]. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as [[information theory]], [[electrical engineering]],  [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]]—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the transmitted data.

===Computational learning theory===
{{main|Computational learning theory}}
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of
inductive learning called supervised learning.  In supervised
learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some
useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of
mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are
edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and
uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that
assigns labels to samples including the samples that have never been
previously seen by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning
algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as
minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kf1ZwDifdAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=urmonotheism |title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|page=136|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=1-85075-657-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=YmgCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Urreligion&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 J L Studach ''Die Urreligion oder das entdeckte Uralphabet'', 1856]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

The '''visual arts''' are [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]] such as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], [[design]], [[craft]]s, [[photography]], [[video]], [[filmmaking]], and [[architecture]]. Many artistic disciplines ([[performing arts]], [[conceptual art]], [[textile arts]]) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts&lt;ref&gt;An About.com article by art expert, Shelley Esaak: [http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/visual_arts.htm?p=1 What Is Visual Art?]&lt;/ref&gt; are the [[applied arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/different-forms-of-art.html ''Different Forms of Art – Applied Art'']. Buzzle.com. Retrieved 11 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], [[interior design]] and [[decorative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |title=Centre for Arts and Design in Toronto, Canada |publisher=Georgebrown.ca |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028075227/http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes [[fine art]] as well as the applied, decorative arts and [[craft]]s, but this was not always the case. Before the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the [[handicraft]], craft, or applied art media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html Art History: Arts and Crafts Movement: (1861–1900). From World Wide Arts Resources] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013011648/http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html |date=13 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art school]]s made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.

The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of [[Western art]] as well as [[Eastern art history|East Asian]] art.  In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour – in [[Chinese painting]] the most highly valued styles were those of "scholar-painting", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western [[hierarchy of genres]] reflected similar attitudes.

==Education and training==
{{main|Visual arts education}}
Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the [[apprentice]] and workshop systems.  In Europe the [[Renaissance]] movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the [[academy]] system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in [[art school]]s at tertiary levels.  Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.

==Drawing==
{{Main|Drawing}}
[[Drawing]] is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to [[Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave representations]] of animals such as those at [[Lascaux]] in France and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain. In [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], ink drawings on [[papyrus]], often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], initially geometric, later developed to the human form with [[black-figure pottery]] during the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibujosparapintar.com/english_activities/drawing_course_history.html History of Drawing. From Dibujos para Pintar.] Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[history of paper|paper]] becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |title=Drawing |date=2006 |website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314224108/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |archive-date=14 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=23 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

===Origins and early history===
{{Main|History of painting}}

Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]] caves in southern France.

Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of [[Ramses II]], [[Nefertari]], his queen, is depicted being led by [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1320&amp;HistoryID=ab20&amp;gtrack=pthc History of Painting.

One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic [[Fayum mummy portraits]]. Another example is mosaic of the [[Battle of Issus]] at [[Pompeii]], which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to [[Byzantine art]] in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.

===The Renaissance===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}

Apart from the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced by monks during the [[Middle Ages]], the next significant contribution to European art was from [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italy's renaissance painters]]. From [[Giotto]] in the 13th century to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in [[Art of Italy|Italian art]] as the ''chiaroscuro'' techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.evansville.edu/rl29/art340/f04/renaissancepainting.html History of Renaissance Painting.

Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school. [[Jan van Eyck]] from Belgium, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] from the Netherlands and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times. They used the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing technique]] with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.

===Dutch masters===
{{Main|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile [[Rembrandt]] who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and [[Vermeer]] who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.

===Baroque===
{{Main|Baroque}}
The [[Baroque]] started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included [[Caravaggio]], who made heavy use of [[tenebrism]]. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was a [[flemish]] painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in [[Antwerp]] and also painted a series for [[Marie de' Medici]]. [[Annibale Carracci]] took influences from the [[Sistine Chapel]] and created the genre of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the resulting [[Counter Reformation]]. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutsaers |first=Inge |url=https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Rethinking_the_Baroque_Intro.pdf |title=Ashgate Joins Routledge - Routledge |publisher=Ashgate.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionism===
{{Main|Impressionism}}
[[Impressionism]] began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio. This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality. They achieved intense colour vibration by using pure, unmixed colours and short brush strokes. The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art. Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impressionist art &amp; paintings, What is Impressionist art?

===Post-impressionism===
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism. Of particular note are [[Paul Gauguin]], who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, [[Vincent van Gogh]], a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south, and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of [[Montmartre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Post-Impressionism. Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism, expressionism and cubism===
{{Main|Modern art}}
[[Edvard Munch]], a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist [[Manet]]. ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Ernst Kirschner]] and [[Erich Heckel]] began to distort reality for an emotional effect.
In parallel, the style known as [[cubism]] developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition. [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were the leading proponents of the movement. Objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form. By the 1920s, the style had developed into surrealism with [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]] and [[René Magritte|Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm Modern Art Movements.

==Printmaking==
[[File:Ancientchineseinstrumentalists.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists|Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists]]
{{Main|Printmaking}}
[[Printmaking]] is creating, for artistic purposes, an image on a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] that is then transferred to a two-dimensional (flat) surface by means of ink (or another form of pigmentation). Except in the case of a [[monotype]], the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print.
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Albrecht Dürer engraving Melancholia I from 1541 seated angel contemplating figure|Albrecht Dürer: ''[[Melancholia I]]'' (1541)]]
Historically, the major techniques (also called media) involved are [[woodcut]], [[line engraving]], [[etching]], [[lithography]], and screenprinting (serigraphy, silkscreening) but there are many others, including modern digital techniques. Normally, the print is printed on [[paper]], but other mediums range from cloth and [[vellum]] to more modern materials. Major printmaking traditions include that of Japan (''[[ukiyo-e]]'').

===European history===
{{Main|Old master print}}
Prints in the Western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as [[old master print]]s. In Europe, from around 1400 AD [[woodcut]], was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. [[Michael Wolgemut]] improved German woodcut from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]], a Dutchman, was the first to use cross-hatching.  At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed, increasing the status of the single-leaf woodcut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prnt/hd_prnt.htm The Printed Image in the West: History and Techniques.

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
In China, the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper. Initially images were mainly religious but in the [[Song Dynasty]], artists began to cut landscapes. During the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] (1616–1911) dynasties, the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engraving-review.com/chinese-art-engraving.html Engraving in Chinese Art.

===Development In Japan 1603–1867===

{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}
Woodblock printing in Japan (Japanese: 木版画, moku hanga) is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre; however, it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period. Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of movable type, but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late, during the Edo period (1603–1867). Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards, moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used (as opposed to western woodcut, which uses oil-based inks), allowing for a wide range of vivid color, glazes and color transparency.

==Photography==
{{Main|Photography}}

[[Photography]] is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. The process is done through mechanical [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] or electronically timed exposure of [[photon]]s into [[chemical]] processing or [[digitizing]] devices known as [[camera]]s.

The word comes from the [[Greek words]] φως ''phos'' ("light"), and γραφις ''graphis'' ("stylus", "paintbrush") or γραφη ''graphê'', together meaning "drawing with light" or "representation by means of lines" or "drawing." Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a [[photograph]]. The term ''photo'' is an abbreviation; many people also call them ''pictures.'' In digital photography, the term ''image'' has begun to replace ''photograph.'' (The term ''image'' is traditional in geometric [[optics]].)

==Filmmaking==
{{Main| Filmmaking}}

Filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture, from an initial conception and research, through scriptwriting, shooting and recording, animation or other special effects, editing, sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience; it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films, embracing documentary, strains of theatre and literature in film, and poetic or experimental practices, and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well

==Computer art==
{{Main|Computer art}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:wiki.Picture by Drawing Machine 2.jpg|thumb|Picture produced by Drawing Machine 2]] --&gt;

Visual artists are no longer limited to [[Media (arts)|traditional art media]]. Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s. Uses include the [[Image capture|capturing]] or creating of images and forms, the editing of those images and forms (including exploring multiple [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]]) and the final [[Artistic rendering|rendering]] or [[printing]] (including [[3D printing]]).

'''Computer art''' is any in which [[computer]]s played a role in production or display. Such art can be an image, sound, [[computer animation|animation]], [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and [[new media]] works created using computers have been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithmic art]] and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can be difficult. Nevertheless, this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits, though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting.

Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between [[illustrator]]s, [[photographer]]s, [[Image editing|photo editors]], [[3D modeling|3-D modelers]], and handicraft artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. [[Photographer]]s may become [[digital art]]ists. Illustrators may become [[animator]]s. Handicraft may be [[computer-aided]] or use [[computer-generated imagery]] as a template. Computer [[clip art]] usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and [[page layout]] less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of [[pagination|paginating]] a document, especially to the unskilled observer.

==Plastic arts==
{{main|Plastic arts}}

'''Plastic arts''' is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. The term has also been applied to ''all the visual (non-literary, non-musical) arts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.ksu.edu.sa/DOC/Articles19/Article190588.doc Art Terminology at KSU]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete or steel, have also been included in the narrower definition, since, with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This use of the term "plastic" in the arts should not be confused with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s use, nor with the movement he termed, in French and English, "[[Neoplasticism]]."

===Sculpture===
{{main|Sculpture}}

Sculpture is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Work of art|artwork]] created by shaping or combining hard or [[plastic]] material, sound, or text and or light, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[clay]], [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built together and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Sculptures are often [[paint]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity 22 September 2007 Through 20 January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.

Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand. With increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of [[conceptual art]] over technical mastery, more sculptors turned to [[Art fabrication|art fabricators]] to produce their artworks. With fabrication, the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it. This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement, metal and plastic, that they would not be able to create by hand. Sculptures can also be made with [[3-d printing]] technology.

'''Vulnerability''' refers to the inability (of a system or a unit) to withstand the effects of a hostile environment. A '''window of vulnerability''' ('''WOV''') is a time frame within which defensive measures are diminished, compromised or lacking.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The understanding of social and environmental vulnerability, as a methodological approach, involves the analysis of the risks and assets of disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly. The approach of vulnerability in itself brings great expectations of social policy and gerontological planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2011 | volume=17(69) | title=Social Vulnerability approach to investigate the social and environmental disadvantages.

==Common applications==
In relation to [[hazard]]s and [[disaster]]s, vulnerability is a concept that links the relationship that people have with their [[natural environment|environment]] to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them. “The concept of vulnerability expresses the multi-dimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mapping Vulnerability: Disasters, Development and People | publisher=Earth scan | author=Bankoff, Greg| year=2004 | location=London|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the extent to which changes could harm a system, or to which the community can be affected by the impact of a hazard or exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally: "we were in a vulnerable position".

==Research==
Within the body of literature related to vulnerability, major research streams include questions of [[methodology]], such as: measuring and assessing vulnerability, including finding appropriate indicators for various aspects of vulnerability, up- and down scaling methods, and participatory methods.&lt;ref&gt;Villagran, Juan Carlos. "Vulnerability: A conceptual and methodological review." SOURCE. No. 2/2006.

===Social===
{{Main article|Social vulnerability}}
In its sense, social vulnerability is one dimension of vulnerability to multiple [[stressor]]s (agent responsible for stress) and [[Acute stress reaction|shock]]s, including [[abuse]], [[social exclusion]] and [[natural hazards]]. Social vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organizations, and societies to withstand adverse impacts from multiple stressors to which they are exposed. These impacts are due in part to characteristics inherent in social interactions, institutions, and systems of cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros.

In this respect, there is a need to place an increased emphasis on assets and entitlements for understanding ‘catastrophe’ as opposed to solely the strength or severity of shocks.&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08d11e5274a31e000160c/24Prowse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A cognitive vulnerability, in [[cognitive psychology]], is an erroneous belief, [[cognitive bias]], or pattern of thought that is believed to predispose the individual to psychological problems.&lt;ref name = "black"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author-last=Riskind|author-first=John H.|author2-last=Black|author2-first=David|title=Cognitive Vulnerability|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Cognitive Behavior Therapy|editor=Freeman, Arthur |editor2=Felgoise, Stephanie H.|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781429411738|pages=122–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yizTVUCYy4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Cognitive+Behavior+Therapy#v=onepage&amp;q=Cognitive%20Vulnerability&amp;f=false |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in place before the symptoms of psychological disorders start to appear, such as high neuroticism,&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the individual encounters a stressful experience, the cognitive vulnerability shapes a [[maladaptation|maladaptive]] response that may lead to a psychological disorder.&lt;ref name = "black"/&gt; In [[psychopathology]], cognitive vulnerability is constructed from schema models, hopelessness models, and attachment theory.&lt;ref name = "rick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Rick|title=Origins of Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=27|issue=1|date=February 2003|pages=77–88|issn=	0147-5916|url=http://www.people.ku.edu/~reingram/PDFs/origins.pdf|doi=10.1023/a:1022590730752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attentional bias]] is one mechanism leading to faulty cognitive bias that leads to cognitive vulnerability.

In military terminology, vulnerability is a subset of [[survivability]], the others being susceptibility and recoverability. Vulnerability is defined in various ways depending on the nation and service arm concerned, but in general it refers to the near-instantaneous effects of a weapon attack. In aviation it is defined as the inability of an aircraft to withstand the damage caused by the man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some definitions, recoverability (damage control, firefighting, restoration of capability) is included in vulnerability. Some military services develop their own concept of vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/Warship-Hits.html|title=Warship Vulnerability|first=Kopp,|last=Carlo|date=5 July 2005|website=ausairpower.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invulnerability&lt;!--'Invulnerability' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Invulnerability'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a common feature found in science fiction and fantasy, in particular in [[superhero fiction]], as depicted commonly in novels, [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. In such stories, it is a quality that makes a character impervious to pain, damage or loss of health. 

In video games, it can be found in the form of "[[power-up]]s" or [[cheats#In video games|cheats]]; when activated via cheats, it is often referred to as "[[glossary of video game terms#God mode|god mode]]". Generally, it does not protect the player from certain instant-death hazards, most notably "bottomless" pits from which, even if the player were to survive the fall, they would be unable to escape. As a rule, invulnerability granted by power-ups is temporary, and wears off after a set amount of time, while invulnerability cheats, once activated, remain in effect until deactivated, or the end of the level is reached. Depending on the game in question, invulnerability to damage may or may not protect the player from non-damage effects, such as being immobilized or sent flying.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
	
In [[comic book]]s, some superheroes are considered invulnerable, though this usually only applies up to a certain level (e.g. [[Superman]] is invulnerable to physical attacks from normal people but not to the extremely powerful attacks of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] or those at his level or higher). In the [[manga]], webcomic and [[anime]] series ''[[One-Punch Man]]'', for example, the main protagonist [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]] is completely immune to all kinds of attacks, whether it be blunt attacks, environmental-based attacks (like heat or cold), slashing attacks or pressure-point based attacks, and unharmed by physical laws.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In mythology, talismans, charms, and amulets were created by magic users for the purpose of making the wearer immune to injury from both mystic and mundane weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
