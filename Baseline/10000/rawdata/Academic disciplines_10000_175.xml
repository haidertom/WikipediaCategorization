[[File:65Cyb-LB3-apmag.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Asteroid [[65 Cybele]] and two stars, with their magnitudes labeled]]

The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''{{mvar|m}}''') of an [[astronomical object]] is a number that is a measure of its [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on Earth. The magnitude scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. A difference of 1 in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512. The brighter an object appears, the lower its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] value (i.e. inverse relation), with the brightest astronomical objects having negative apparent magnitudes: for example [[Sirius]] at −1.46.

The measurement of apparent magnitudes or brightnesses of celestial objects is known as [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Apparent magnitudes are used to quantify the brightness of sources at [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[infrared]] wavelengths. An apparent magnitude is usually measured in a specific [[passband]] corresponding to some [[photometric system]] such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]]. In standard astronomical notation, an apparent magnitude in the V ("visual") filter band would be denoted either as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; or often simply as ''V'', as in "''m''&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15" or "''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15" to describe a 15th-magnitude object.

The scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]].

In 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856|bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.

Apart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[Infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.

With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of −1.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.

Astronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=March 15, 1983|volume=266|pages=713–717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.

== Calculations ==

[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|A graph of apparent magnitude against brightness]]

As the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], any measurement of apparent magnitude is [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|corrected]] for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x}= -5 \log_{100} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x'',0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} ≈&amp;nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} Δ''m''}} implies a brightness factor of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\frac{\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \Delta m} \approx 2.512^{\Delta m}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Sun and Moon ===
''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''

The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the [[full moon]] is −12.74 (dimmer).

Difference in magnitude: 
:&lt;math&gt; x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. &lt;/math&gt;

Brightness factor: 
:&lt;math&gt; v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \times 14.00} \approx 398\,107.17. &lt;/math&gt;

The Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.

===Magnitude addition===
Sometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 10^{-m_f \times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \times 0.4}. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;m_f&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt; m_f = -2.5\log_{10} \left(10^{-m_1 \times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \times 0.4} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Absolute magnitude===
{{main|Absolute magnitude}}
Since flux decreases with distance according to the [[inverse-square law]], a particular apparent magnitude could equally well refer to a star at one distance, or a star four times brighter at twice that distance, and so on. When one is not interested in the brightness as viewed from Earth, but the ''intrinsic'' brightness of an astronomical object, then one refers not to the apparent magnitude but the absolute magnitude. The absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s (about 32.6 [[light-year]]s). The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).&lt;ref name="Bband"&gt;{{cite web

It is important to note that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber–Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C. V.|last2=Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|issue=10|page=1003|date=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&amp;nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&amp;nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&amp;nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as visual magnitude.

Because cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=umeh&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.

For planets and other Solar System bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and the distances to the Sun and observer.

The '''Asa Wright Nature Centre and Lodge''' is a [[ecotourism|nature resort]] and scientific research station in the [[Arima]] Valley of the [[Northern Range]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The centre is one of the top [[birdwatching]] spots in the [[Caribbean]]; a total of 159 species of [[bird]]s have been recorded there. The centre is owned by a [[non-profit]] trust.

The nature centre is on 270 acres and includes a main estate house with inn and restaurant serving dishes such as [[callaloo]] soup with ingredients from an on-site organic garden.&lt;ref name=afar/&gt; Non-adjacent properties have also been added to the centre's land holdings.

==Description==
[[File:Asa Wright, her porch at Springhill home.1963, Trinidad.jpg|thumb|Asa Wright at home in 1967]]
The major properties are the '''Spring Hill Estate''' and the adjacent '''[[William Beebe]] Tropical Research Station''' (also known as '''Simla'''), which was established by the famous naturalist and explorer [[William Beebe]] as a tropical research station for the [[New York Zoological Society]]. Beebe bought the 'Verdant Vale' estate in 1949 and named it after [[Shimla|Simla]] in India, which he had visited in 1910.  Beebe stayed at Springhill in 1949 with the Wrights, while water and electricity connections were made to Simla, four miles down the road.  His bedroom is now the Springhill manager's office.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|5-6}} 

The owners of the Spring Hill Estate, Newcombe and Asa Wright, hosted the noted [[ornithologists]] [[David Snow (ornithologist)|David Snow]] and [[Barbara Snow]] in the 1950s.  They made detailed studies of the [[oilbird]]s and the [[Bearded bellbird]].  Starting in 1965, Richard ffrench and Don Eckelberry collaborated in eventually publishing ''A Guide to the Birds of Trinidad and Tobago''.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|47-49,51-52}}

The Wrights' home became internationally renowned for its easy access to wildlife, especially the [[oilbird]] (''Steatornis caripensis'') colonies in the nearby [[Dunston Cave]]. The Asa Wright Nature Center was established on 22 Dec. 1967, with the Royal Bank Trust Company (Trinidad) Limited appointed as Trustee.  The Trust was meant to protect Springhill "in perpetuity", developing its agriculture in an "ecologically sound" way while facilitating its "scientific and educational" potential.  Asa was allowed to live out the remaining years of her life according to a provision in agreement.  She passed away in 1971.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|25,65-69}} In 1974, the New York Zoological Society donated Simla to the trust.&lt;ref&gt;Gould (2004), p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature centre in 2001 acquired the '''Rapsey Estate''', known as 'El Naranjo' for [[TT$]]3,3 million. The total nature centre holdings are now over 1,300 acres, but this still makes up less than 5% of the valley.&lt;ref name=Joy/&gt;{{rp|131,153}}

==Springhill== 
The home was built in 1906-8 on the cocoa estate originally known as Clearwater by Charles Meyer, on property bought by his father Fredrich Wilhelm Meyer in the Arima Valley.  The first four of eleven children between Charles and his wife Julia Marie Pouchet were born at Springhill.  The house was characterized by high ceilings, six rooms, with a hallway between the rear four, and a wide veranda overlooking the valley.  However, his father's estates were confiscated in [[World War I]] by the Trinidad colonial government, since he was of German origin. 

Charles' cocoa estate, already mortgaged, could no longer turn a profit when plagued by [[witch's broom]], and was reverted to the Agricultural Bank in 1925.  Andrew and Marianne Bernard bought the property in 1926, but once again the estate reverted to the bank.  The estate remained neglected until purchased in 1936 by Joseph Holmes, son of [[Joseph Austin Holmes]].  Holmes added two bathrooms, a water supply, [[septic tank]], generator, two room guest house, and a bathing pool at the foot of the waterfall.  

In the 1930s, it became a weekend retreat for [[Pan Am]] pilots, US Navy families, and government officials.  After [[World War II]], Newcome and Asa Wright bought all of the property except the ten acres containing the guest house, pool and waterfall.  However, in 1955, Asa acquired that remaining acreage after Newcome's death.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudder|first1=Joy|title=The Old House and the Dream|date=2009|publisher=Prospect Press|location=Port of Spain|isbn=9789769508217|pages=11,21-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
The centre is one of the most biodiverse areas in the West Indies and is home to more than 400 bird species. Bird species at the nature centre include [[purple honeycreeper]], [[tufted coquette]] (a hummingbird), [[tropical mockingbird]], and [[oilbird]] (a nocturnal fruit eater).&lt;ref name=afar&gt;5 Asa Wright Nature Centre; Trinidad and Tobago November/ December 2011 Afar page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red brocket deer]] as well as the elusive  [[ocelot]] can be seen in the nature centre's trails. [[Agouti]] is also a common animal that occurs in the centre.

The '''[[biological monitoring]] working party''' ('''BMWP''') is a procedure for measuring [[water quality]] using families of [[macroinvertebrate]]s as [[biological indicator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkes|first1=H.A|title=Origin and development of the biological monitoring working party score system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135497002753|journal=Water Research|accessdate=28 July 2016|doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00275-3|volume=32|pages=964–968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is based on the principle that different [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invertebrate]]s have different tolerances to [[pollutant]]s. In the case of BMWP, this is based on the sensitivity/tolerance to [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollution]] (i.e. nutrient enrichment that can affect the availability of [[dissolved oxygen]]). It is important to recognise that the ranking of sensitivity/tolerance will vary for different kinds of pollution. In the case of BMWP/Organic pollution rankings, the presence of [[mayfly|mayflies]] or [[stonefly|stoneflies]] for instance indicate the cleanest waterways and are given a tolerance score of 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nethan-valley.co.uk/insectgroups.doc  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212185438/http://www.nethan-valley.co.uk/insectgroups.doc |date=December 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest scoring invertebrates are worms (''Oligochaeta'') which score 1. The number of different macroinvertebrates is also an important factor, because a better quality water  is assumed to contain fewer pollutants that would exclude "sensitive" species - resulting in a higher diversity.

[[Kick sampling]], where a net is placed downstream from the sampler and the river bed is agitated with the foot for a given period of time (the standard is 3 minutes), is employed. Any macroinvertebrates caught in the net are stored and preserved with an alcohol solution, and identified to the [[family (biology)|family]] level, this can be done with the live organisms as well.

The BMWP score equals the sum of the tolerance scores of all macroinvertebrate families in the sample. A higher BMWP score is considered to reflect a better water quality. Alternatively, also the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) score is calculated. The ASPT equals the average of the tolerance scores of all macroinvertebrate families found, and ranges from 0 to 10. The main difference between both indices is that ASPT does not depend on the family richness. Once BMWP and ASPT are calculated, the Lincoln Quality Index (LQI) is used to assess the water quality in the Anglian Water Authority area.

Other indices that can be used to assess water quality are the [[Chandler Score]], the [[Trent Biotic Index]] and the ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocols''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, M.T., J. Gerritsen, B.D. Snyder, and J.B. Stribling.

==History==
The British Society for Developmental Biology was founded in 1948 as the London Embryologists’
Club. In 1964 it was expanded from a club into a scientific society named the Society for Developmental Biology. However in 1964 the [[Society for Developmental Biology|Society for the Study of Growth and Development]] in the United States had also voted to change to the same name, and in 1966 took over sponsorship of the journal [[Developmental Biology]]. In 1969 the smaller British society changed to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slack |first=Jonathan M. W. |title=A short history of the British Society for Developmental Biology |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/10761851 |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |year=2003 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=79-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">The '''Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station''' is one of the several field stations for biological research that exist in [[Costa Rica]].

Located at 3,200 m [[elevation]] (approximately 10,500 feet) on the southeastern slope of the Cerro Bellavista (one of the highest points in the ''[[Cordillera de Talamanca]]''), this is the biological station located at the highest elevation in Costa Rica and perhaps{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in all of Central America.

Mr. Federico Valverde, the owner of the station is a former [[herpetologist]] from the [[University of Costa Rica]] who decided to protect these lands and offer them to the scientific community. For this reason, the station is only open for research and academic purposes. This offers an opportunity for scientists that are interested in studying the higher [[oak]] forests ranging from 3,100 – 3,400 m (approximately 10,000-11,000 feet) as well as the [[páramo]] ecosystem above the tree line.

The mission of the station is to protect the natural beauty of the páramo, to conduct long-term research on natural systems as part of a global effort to understand and preserve the Earth's biodiversity, and to increase appreciation of this effort through innovative, field-based educational programs for student of all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerrodelamuerte.com Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station 1.gif|right|thumb|150px|Lichens at the station]]
The dominant tree species is ''Quercus costarricensis'', although many other trees, [[shrubs]] and [[vine]]s occur in the area. A number of vertebrates and insects can also be observed at this station. Currently there is data listing mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, [[algae]], [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]]&lt;ref&gt;Rojas C, Stephenson SL. 2007. Distribution and ecology of myxomycetes in the high-elevation oak forests of Cerro Bellavista, Costa Rica. Mycologia 99(4): 534.543&lt;/ref&gt; and [[plants]].

Researchers from all over the world visit this station every year. However, many United States' academic institutions come year after year with groups of students interested in tropical [[ecology]]. Some courses at the University of Costa Rica also offer field trips to this area.

The staff of the station take care of the visitors by providing them with the basic services offered in any other field station in the world. However, they are locally known for making their own [[hot sauce]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7642">[[File:Co-citation Proximity Analysis Concept.svg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Documents B and C are cited in closer proximity to each other in the full-text of the citing document, when compared to document A. Hence, according to co-citation proximity analysis, documents B and C are more strongly related than documents A and B or A and C. |Figure visualizing the Co-citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) approach to document similarity computation.]]
'''Co-citation Proximity Analysis''' or '''CPA''' is a document [[similarity measure]] that uses [[Citation| citation analysis]] to assess semantic similarity between documents at both the global document level as well as at individual section-level.&lt;ref name="Gipp"&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf "Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis"] in Birger Larsen and Jacqueline Leta, editors, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI’09), volume 2, pages 571–575, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel. "Method and system for detecting a similarity of documents". Patent Application, Oct 27, 2011. [http://www.patentlens.net/patentlens/patents.html?patnums=US_2011_0264672_A1&amp;language=en&amp;|US 2011/0264672 A1].&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity measure builds on the [[Co-citation|co-citation analysis]] approach, but differs in that it exploits the information implied in the placement of citations within the full-texts of documents.

Co-citation Proximity Analysis was conceived by B. Gipp in 2006&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp, 2006. "Doctoral Proposal: (Co-)Citation Proximity Analysis – A Measure to Identify Related Work"&lt;/ref&gt; and the description of the document similarity measure was later published by Gipp and Beel in 2009.&lt;ref name="Gipp" /&gt; The similarity measure rests on the assumption that within a document’s full-text, the documents cited in close proximity to each other tend to be more strongly related than those documents cited farther apart. The figure to the right illustrates the concept. The CPA approach to document similarity assumes the documents B and C to be more strongly related than the documents B and A, because the citations to B and C occur within the same sentence, whereas the citations to B and A are separated by several paragraphs.

The advantage of the CPA approach compared to other citation and co-citation analysis approaches is an improvement in precision. Other widely used citation analysis approaches, such as [[Bibliographic coupling|Bibliographic Coupling]], [[Co-citation|Co-Citation]] or the [[Bibliographic coupling#History|Amsler measure]], do not take into account the location or proximity of citations within documents. The CPA approach allows a more granular automatic classification of documents and can also be used to identify not only related documents, but the specific sections within texts that are most related.

==Method of calculation==
The CPA similarity measure calculates a '''Citation Proximity Index''' ('''CPI''') for each set of documents cited by an examined document.&lt;ref name="Gipp" /&gt; Cited documents are assigned a weight of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' stands for the  number of levels between citations. Beginning at the lowest level, levels may be defined as citation groups, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and finally the entire document or even journal.

There are several variations of the CPA algorithm.

*''Basic-CPA'' – fundamental concept of CPA as described above
*''Extended-CPA'' – considers the tree structure and order of citations within citation groups
*''Multidimensional-CPA'' – uses additional information such as the impact factor 
*''Hybrid-CPA'' – combines the CPI with other similarity measures, for example text-based measures. This boosts performance especially for documents with insufficient citation information.

==Performance==
The CPA similarity measure builds upon the co-citation document similarity approach with the distinctive addition of proximity analysis. Therefore, the CPA approach allows for the calculation of a more granular resolution of overall document similarity. CPA has been found to outperform co-citation analysis, especially when documents contain extensive bibliographies and in cases where documents have not been frequently cited together (i.e. have a low co-citation score).&lt;ref name="Gipp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarzer16"&gt;M. Schwarzer, M. Schubotz, N. Meuschke, C. Breitinger, V. Markl, and B. Gipp, [https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/schwarzer2016.pdf "Evaluating Link-based Recommendations for Wikipedia"] in Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), New York, NY, USA, 2016, pp. 191-200. &lt;/ref&gt; Liu and Chen found that sentence-level co-citations are potentially more efficient markers for use in co-citation analysis in comparison to the loosely coupled article-level only co-citations, since sentence-level co-citations tend to preserve the essential structure of the traditional co-citation network and also form a much smaller subset of all co-citation instances.&lt;ref&gt;Shengbo Liu and Chaomei Chen, 2001 [http://cluster.ischool.drexel.edu/~cchen/papers/2011/ISSI2011.pdf "The Effects of Co-citation Proximity on Co-citation Analysis"], The 13th Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI), July 4–7, 2011 Durban, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An analysis by Schwarzer et al.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer16" /&gt; showed that the citation-based measures CPA and [[Co-citation|co-citation analysis]], have complementary strengths compared to text-based similarity measures. Text-based similarity approaches reliably identified more narrowly similar articles out of a test collection of Wikipedia articles, e.g. articles sharing identical terms, while the CPA approach outperformed CoCit at identifying more broadly related articles, as well as more popular articles, which the authors claim to likely also be of higher quality.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer16" /&gt;

'''Community Greens''', sometimes referred to as ''backyard commons'', ''urban [[Common lands|common]]s'', or [[pocket neighborhood]]s, are shared open green spaces on the inside of city blocks, created either when residents merge backyard space or reclaim underutilized urban land such as vacant lots and [[Alley|alleyway]]s. These shared spaces are communally used and managed only by the residents whose homes abut them. They are not a public park, a private backyard, or a community garden; however, they can function as all three.

==Community Greens==
Community Greens is an organization concerned with the development of shared green spaces in residential neighborhoods in American cities. These green spaces are community greens.  The Community Greens movement believes that such an approach presents the best opportunity to add usable green space to American cities, by converting under utilized backyards and dysfunctional alleys into functional and beautiful shared green spaces that are owned, managed, and enjoyed by the people who live around them.

This has led communities in numerous American cities, including Boston, Sacramento, Baltimore, New York, and San Francisco, taking down their backyard fences, to create backyard commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112110/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Greens are multi-functional spaces for gardening, recreation, and leisure which are designed to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to urban residents. The creation of  backyard commons can lead to an increased interaction with neighbors throughout the planning and implementation process, which may result in a stronger overall sense of community. Other possible social benefits that are claimed include decreased crime, from having more eyes on the street, and safe places where children can play and adults relax. Community Greens, like other types of urban green spaces, can significantly improve the ecological functioning of urban habitats. Vegetation and permeable pavement can slow storm water runoff and increase groundwater, which in turn can reduce pollutant flowing into nearby bodies of water during a storm. Urban environments are often significantly warmer than outlying suburbs, mostly due to the prevalence of  heat retentive concrete surfaces. City trees can mitigate this effect through shading, etc..&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, AH, and Romm, JJ. (Feb/Mar97 ) “Painting the town white-and green.”''MIT's Technology Review''. 100(2):52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The taking down  of backyards fences transforms fragmented habitats to connected corridors for urban wildlife. Furthermore because city dwellers recognize value in green space, often simply from an aesthetic standpoint, and this may be reflected through increased property values.&lt;ref&gt;Been, V.

==The beginnings in Maryland==
* Community Greens was founded as an offshoot of Ashoka, by Ashoka founder [[Bill Drayton]] in 2001.
* Spearheaded a state wide legislature in [[Maryland]], which changed the City Charter which allows the city to lease and gate alleys to homeowners.
* Started the Alley Gating and Alley Greening pilot project in [[Baltimore]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alley greening [http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Divisions/AlleyGatingGreeningProgram.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local ordinance passed in the City of Baltimore in 2007.
* As of 2009, there are 3 completely gated and greened alleys in Baltimore and over 70 applications from interested neighborhoods.

===Baltimore: The pilot project===
In 2002, a group of residents from the [[Patterson Park]] neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore, and these two groups were put into contact. The Luzerne-Glover block was granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Community Greens, the Patterson Park CDC, the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association and the Luzurne‐Glover block group turned to University of Maryland law professor Barbara Bezdek, who enlisted the help of her law students, who researched existing laws and current uses of Baltimore alleyways.

[[File:Luzerne and Chandlers Yard Before.jpg|thumb|alt=Luzerne alleyway before gating and greening|The Luzerne-Glover Block alley before gating and greening]]

Looking for a permanent solution, these groups aligned themselves with the Mayor's Department of Neighborhoods and took their case to Annapolis. Maryland Delegate [[Peter A. Hammen]] sponsored House Bill 1533 to amend the Baltimore City Charter, allowing the City to close alleyways and lease them to interested parties. The Luzerne-Glover group testified before the Environmental Committee of the state legislature and House Bill 1533 passed in 2004. Community Greens then worked with law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], in collaboration with Barbara Bezdek, to draft a city alley gating and leasing ordinance, which was then submitted to the City of Baltimore.

In April 2007, the [[Baltimore City Council]] under the leadership of newly elected Mayor [[Shelia Dixon]], passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.

Interested communities need approval from several Baltimore City Departments, including Solid Waste, Transportation, Fire, and Police to ensure that proposed alley projects meet the necessary infrastructural conditions. Once initial approval is received, residents submit an application to the Department of Public Works, which includes the necessary consent forms from homeowners and a signed affidavit stating that attempts were made to obtain approval from all homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525041536/http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luzerne Glover neighborhood now has their green alleyway, and is the first community in Baltimore to use the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225084428/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, seven Baltimore communities have successfully completed this process and have created eight useful Community Greens from the underutilized alleyways in their backyards.

==Other existing greens==

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628111701/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/montgomerypark/Montgomery%20Park.htm Montgomery Park - Boston, Massachusetts]===
'''Montgomery Park''' is a third of an acre common space shared by 85 households in Boston's South End neighborhood. From the time the neighborhood was first developed in the 1860s through the 1970s, the park was separated from the residents' backyards by an alley and fence. In more recent years, residents began to connect the park to their individual yards by replacing the alley separating their private backyards from the park with a narrower brick walkway and tearing down backyard fences. Additionally, residents have moved garbage collection to the front street and convinced utility companies to bury service lines. Residents now enjoy greater access to the shared Community Green, and use it for gardening and recreation.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090625143531/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/stoneycreek/stoneycreek.htm Stoney Creek Apartments - Livermore, California]===
'''Stoney Creek Apartments''' were constructed in 1992 to address a lack of affordable housing in [[Livermore, California]]. Ten residential buildings share five courtyards, accessible from a small alleyway. Homes have front and back patios in addition to the shared courtyards, and neighbors have the opportunity to enjoy this shared outdoor space and experience a heightened sense of community. The inward-facing position of these patios allows parents to keep a watchful eye on children playing in the courtyard.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124249/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/chandlersyard/chandlersyard.htm Chandlers Yard - Baltimore, Maryland]===
Located in the Federal Hill neighborhood of downtown Baltimore and hidden behind eleven narrow rowhouses, '''Chandler's Yard''' is a tree-shaded courtyard that was carved out of the backyards of the surrounding homes by developer Bill Struever who wanted to make living on the block more attractive to potential buyers. Struever convinced some of the property owners in this block to give up part of their backyards for this shared courtyard and pay a small construction fee. The result is a beautiful shared space for these residents, who enjoy a heightened sense of security and increased property values.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163042/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/villagehomes/villagehomes.htm Village Homes - Davis, California]===
The '''Village Homes''' development is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots are smaller than the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that eliminate the need for an expensive storm-water sewer system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630004718/http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/jacksonheights/jacksonheights.htm Jackson Heights - Queens, New York]===
For nearly nine decades, the historic neighborhood of '''Jackson Heights''' in Queens has maintained its fourteen block-long shared interior courtyards, and is considered to be the first "garden apartments" constructed in the United States. These spaces have helped to sustain the blocks' distinctive appeal since their development in the early decades of the last century. Over the years, Jackson Heights residents fought to hold on to their gardens and green spaces in the midst of a city where high property values create an intense pressure to develop any available open space.  The preservation of these shared spaces has increased both community pride and residential property values; if these inner courtyards had been developed, Jackson Heights property values would have dropped by one-third. In 1993, Jackson Heights was officially declared a historic district by the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, furthering sense of place for this community.

===[http://www.communitygreens.org/st-francis-square St. Francis Square - San Francisco, California]===
A cooperative apartment community, '''St. Francis Square''' consists of 299 apartments wrapped around three shared, open spaces. These community greens are full of gardens, basketball courts, playgrounds, and quiet places to relax.  St. Francis Square was established as a limited equity co-operative apartment, although it converted to market rate ownership in 2004.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124254/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/hopecommunity/hope.htm The Hope Community - Minneapolis, MN]===
Fifteen years ago, this community was situated in an area of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, [http://www.hope-community.org/ Hope Community, Inc]. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, '''the Hope Community''' has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a troubled urban area.

==Green alleys==
Something similar has taken place in various cities in North America, involving the [[greening]] of [[back lane]]s or [[alley]]s. This includes [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/pmp/greenalleyhandbook_chicago.pdf "The Chicago Green Alley Handbook"] on the City of Seattle website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpl.org/green-alleys "Green Alleys"] on the [[Trust for Public Land]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddot.dc.gov/publication/ddot-green-alley-project-fact-sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montréal]], Canada, who have started to reclaim their alleys from garbage and crime by [[greening]] the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects+and+Planning/Environment/Green+Alley+Projects "Green Alley Projects"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104000808/http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects%2Band%2BPlanning/Environment/Green%2BAlley%2BProjects |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the District of Columbia Department of Transportation website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104095801/http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the ''Integrated Alleys'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]] has about {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of alleyways.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html "Service: Green Alleys"] on the City of Chicago website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Chicago Department of Transportation]] started converting conventional alleys which were paved with [[asphalt]] into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in [[Chicago]] are not connected to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]] in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140103190427/http://www.screamtobegreen.com/2007/11/chicago-alleys-to-go-green/ "Chicago Alleys to Go Green"] on the ''Scream to be Green'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Connections''''' is a 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary]] television series and 1978 book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]. The series was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] of the [[BBC]] Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the [[history of science]] and [[invention]], and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and [[deadpan|dry humour]]), [[historical re-enactment]]s, and intricate working [[scale model|models]].

The popular success of the series led to the production of ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997), both for [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. In 2004, [[KPJK|KCSM-TV]] produced a program called ''Re-Connections'', consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content==
[[File:Pike Square.JPG|thumb|Modern soldiers demonstrate the use of steel-tipped [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] against [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] in one of the many re-enactments used in ''Connections''.]]
''Connections'' explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and [[teleology|teleological]] view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

To demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[middle ages|medieval times]]) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode "The Long Chain" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the [[fluyt]], a type of Dutch [[cargo ship]].

Burke also explores three [[corollary|corollaries]] to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, [[Future shock|becomes too much for the average person]] to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

Lastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] or the funding of controversial projects such as [[stem cell]] research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?

The original 1978 '''''Connections''''' 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary television series]] and had a companion book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]].  The 1978 Connections companion book was published about the time the middle of the series was airing, so likely was written in parallel to the series and had a post-production editing release.&lt;ref&gt;This is not the ISBN of the original 1978 book, but those available online March 2017 via used book web sites {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions.  Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes.  It can be found in many libraries.

# "The Trigger Effect" details the world's present dependence on complex technological networks through a detailed narrative of New York City and the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|power blackout of 1965]]. Agricultural technology is traced to its origins in [[ancient Egypt]] and the invention of the [[plough]]. The segment ends in [[Kuwait]] where, because of [[Crude oil|oil]], society leapt from traditional patterns to advanced technology in a period of only about 30 years.
# "Death in the Morning" examines the standardisation of precious metal with the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from [[Greece]] to [[Persia]], ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and [[library at Alexandria]] which included [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Star catalogue|star table]]s. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators during the [[age of discovery]] 14 centuries later following the introduction of [[lateen sail]]s and [[sternpost rudder]]s. Mariners discovered that the [[compass]]'s magnetised needle did not actually point directly north. Investigations into the nature of [[magnetism]] by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Gilbert]] led to the discovery of electricity by way of the [[Electrostatic generator|sulphur ball]] of [[von Guericke]]. Further interest in [[atmospheric electricity]] at the [[Ben Nevis]] [[weather station]] led to [[C. T. R. Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[cloud chamber]] which in turn allowed development of both [[Robert Watson-Watt|Watson-Watt]]'s [[radar]] and (by way of [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s insights) [[nuclear weaponry]].
# "Distant Voices" suggests that telecommunications exist because [[Normans]] had [[stirrups]] for horse riding which in turn led them to further advancements in warfare. Deep mine shafts flooded and scientists in search of a solution examined [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuums]], air pressure, and other natural phenomena.
# "Faith in Numbers" examines the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] from the perspective of how commercialism, [[climate change]], and the [[Black Death]] influenced cultural development. He examines the impact of [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] waterpower on the Industrial Revolution, derived from [[Roman watermill]] technology such as that of the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]]. Also covered are the Gutenberg printing press, the [[Jacquard loom]], and the Hollerith punch card tabulator that led to modern computer programming.
# "The Wheel of Fortune" traces [[astrological]] knowledge in ancient Greek manuscripts from [[Baghdad]]'s founder, Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], via the Muslim monastery/medical school at [[Gundeshapur]], to the medieval Church's need for alarm clocks (the [[water clock|water horologium]] and the [[verge and foliot]] clock). The clock [[mainspring]] gave way to the [[pendulum clock]], but the latter could not be used by mariners, thus the need for [[Machine tool|precision machining]] by way of [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s improved steel (1797) and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s use (1800) of [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]]'s idea of using a screw to better measure (which he took from the [[Polelathe|turner]]'s trade). This process made a better mainspring and was also used by the Royal Navy to make better [[Block (sailing)|blocks]]. [[Honoré Blanc|Le Blanc]] mentioned this same basic idea to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who transmitted this "[[American system of manufacturing|American system of manufactures]]" – precision machine-tooling of [[musket]] parts for interchangeability – to New Englanders [[Eli Whitney]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]], and [[Simeon North]]. The American efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and his [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|psychologist wife]] later improved the whole new system of the modern [[production line]].
# "Thunder in the Skies" implicates the [[Little Ice Age]] (''[[circa]]'' 1300-1850 AD) in the invention of the [[chimney]], as well as [[knitting]], [[button]]s, [[wainscoting]], [[Tapestry|wall tapestries]], [[Plasterwork|wall plastering]], [[glass window]]s ([[Hardwick Hall]] [1597] has "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the [[steam engine]] is then examined: [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[Newcomen engine|engine]] for pumping water out of mines (1712); [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby]]'s cheap iron from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[James Watt]]'s addition of a second [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensing cylinder]] (for cooling) to the engine (1763); [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773–75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, [[Joseph Priestley]], investigated gases, leading [[Alessandro Volta]] to invent "bad air" ([[marsh gas]]) detectors and ignitors. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Drake]] discovered oil (in [[Pennsylvania]]), allowing [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] (in [[Bad Cannstatt]]) to replace [[town gas]] with gasoline as fuel for [[Siegfried Marcus|auto engine]]s (1883). They also invented (in 1892) the [[carburetor]] (inspired by the medical [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizers]], which also developed from Priestley's work) and a new ignition system inspired by Volta's "bad air" detection spark gun. Finally, piano-maker [[Wilhelm Kress]] unsuccessfully attempted (1901) to fly the first [[seaplane]] on an Austrian lake using the new gasoline engine.
# "The Long Chain" traces the invention of the [[fluyt]] freighter in Holland in the 16th century. Voyages were insured by Edward Lloyd ([[Lloyd's of London]]) if the ships' hulls were covered in pitch and tar (which came from the colonies until the American War of Independence in 1776). In [[Culross]], Scotland, [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald Cochrane (9th Earl of Dundonald)]] tried to [[coal gasification|distill coal vapour]] to get [[coal tar]] for ships' hulls, which led to the discovery of [[ammonia]]. The search for artificial [[quinine]] to treat malaria led to the development of artificial dyes, which Germany used to produce fertilizers to grow wheat and led to the advancement of chemistry which in turn led to [[DuPont]]'s discovery of polymers such as nylon.
# "Eat, Drink and Be Merry..." begins with plastic, the plastic credit card, and the concept of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], then leaps back to the time of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the first state to use credit. The [[Dukes of Burgundy|dukes]] used credit for many luxuries, and to buy more armour for a stronger army. The Swiss opposed the army of Burgundy and invented a new military formation (with [[Swiss pikemen|soldiers using pikes]]) called the [[pike square]]. The pike square, along with events following the French Revolution, set in motion the growth in the size of armies and in the use of ill-trained peasant soldiers. Feeding these large armies became a problem for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], which caused the innovation of bottled food. The bottled food was first put in champagne bottles then in tin cans. [[Canned food]] was used for armies and for navies. In one of the bottles, the canned food went bad, and people blamed the spoiled food on "bad air", also known as swamp air. Investigations around "bad air" and malaria led to the innovation of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]]. In 1892, [[Sir James Dewar]] invented a container that could keep liquids hot or cold (the [[thermos]]) which led three men – [[Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], and [[Hermann Oberth]] – to construct a large thermal flask for either [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]] or for [[solid fuel]] combustion for use in [[rocket propulsion]], applying the thermal flask principle to keep [[rocket fuel]] cold and successfully using it for the [[V-2]] rocket and the [[Saturn V rocket]] that put man on the moon.
# "Countdown" connects the invention of the [[movie projector]] to improvements in castle fortifications caused by the invention and use of the [[cannon]]. The use of the cannon caused changes in castle fortifications to eliminate a blind spot where cannon fire could not reach. This improvement in castle defence caused innovation in offensive cannon fire, which eventually required [[map]]s. Thus, a need arose to view and map locations (like a mountain top) from a long distance, which led to the invention of [[limelight]] light source, and later the [[incandescent light]]. Burke turns to the next ingredient for a movie projector, [[Photographic film|film]]. Film is made with [[celluloid]] (made with [[guncotton]]) which was first invented as a substitute for ivory in [[billiard balls]]. Next was the invention of the [[zoopraxiscope]] which was first used for a bet to see if a horse's hooves all left the ground at any point while galloping. The zoopraxiscope used frame-by-frame pictures and holes on the side to allow the machine to pull the film forward. Communication signals for railways using [[Samuel Morse|Morse]]'s telegraph led to [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] discovering how to speak into a microphone creating bumps on a disc that could be played back—the [[phonograph|record player]]. This final ingredient gave [[Sound film|movies sound]]. In summary, Burke connects the invention of the movie projector to four major innovations in history: the incandescent light, the discovery of celluloid, the projector that uses frame-by-frame pictures on celluloid, and finally, recorded sound.
# "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" recaps the theme that change causes more change. Burke ties together the modern inventions in which previous episodes had culminated: telecommunications, the computer, the jet engine, plastics, rockets, television, the production line, and the atomic bomb. All of these inventions come together in the B-52 nuclear bomber. Start with the plow, you get [[irrigation]], [[pottery]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], [[civilisation]] and writing, mathematics, a [[calendar]] to predict floods, empires, and a [[modern world]] where change happens so rapidly you cannot keep up. What do you do? Stop the change? Throw away all technology and live like cavemen? Decide what change will be allowed by law? Or just accept that the world is changing faster than we can keep up with?

===''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994)===
# "Revolutions" – What do all these things have in common—three grandfathers' lifetimes, two revolutions, 1750 [[Cornish steam engine]]s for Cornwall's tin mines, water in mines, [[pumps]], [[steam engines]], [[James Watt|Watt]]'s copier, [[carbon paper]], [[match]]es, phosphorus [[fertiliser]], trains and [[Gene pool|gene-pool]] mixing, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], 24-hour production, educated women, the telephone, high-rise buildings, [[Damascus steel|Damascus]]'s [[sword]]s, steel, diamond, [[carborundum]], [[graphite]], [[oscilloscope]], television, [[Apollo space program]], [[X-ray]] [[crystallography]], [[DNA]] and [[gene therapy]]? You will learn these things in the first episode of Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, "Revolutions".
# "Sentimental Journeys" – What do these have in common – [[Freud]], lifestyle crisis, [[electric shock therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[magnetism]], [[phrenology]], [[penology]], [[physiology]], [[synthetic dyes]], the [[Bunsen burner]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Fraunhofer lines]], [[astronomical telescope]]s, [[chromatic aberrations]], and [[surveying]]? Follow James Burke on the trail of discovering the connections between these and others in "Sentimental Journeys".
# "Getting it Together" – James Burke explains the relationship between [[hot air balloons]] and [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]], and goes on to surgery, hydraulic-water gardens, [[hydraulic rams]], [[Alpine Tunnel|tunnelling through the Alps]], the [[Orient Express]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[heart attacks]] and [[headaches]], [[aspirin]], [[carbolic acid]], [[disinfectants]], [[Maybach]]-[[Gottlieb Daimler]]-[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], [[carburetors]], [[helicopters]], [[typewriters]], [[punch cards]], and [[IBM]].
# "Whodunit?" – This episode starts with a [[billiard ball]] and ends with a billiard ball. Along the way, Burke examines [[Georgius Agricola]]'s ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', how mining supported war, the role of money, the [[Spanish Armada]], large ships, problems posed by a wood shortage, [[glass making]], coal, [[plate glass]], [[mirror]]s, the [[sextant]], the discovery of [[granite]], and seashells in the mountains, which enabled a new view of the [[age of the earth]], and [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], [[Francis Galton]]'s ''[[Eugenics]]'', and the [[fingerprinting|forensic use of fingerprints]].
# "Something for Nothing" – How do [[space shuttle]] landings start with the [[vacuum]] which was [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|forbidden by the Church]]? Burke takes us on an adventure with barometers, [[weather forecasting]], muddy and blacktop roads, rain [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[sewage]], a [[cholera]] epidemic, [[hygiene]], [[plumbing]], [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[vacuum pump]]s, [[Drill#Types|compressed-air drills]], tunnels in the Alps, [[railway air brake|train air brakes]], [[hydroelectric power]], the [[electric motor]], [[Galvani]]'s [[Muscle electrostimulation#History|muscle-electricity connection]], [[Alessandro Volta#First battery|Volta's battery]], and [[gyroscopes]].
# "Echoes of the Past" – The past in this case starts with the [[Indian tea culture#Dutch exploration|tea in Dutch-ruled India]], examines the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[porcelain]], the architecture of Florence, [[Delftware]], [[Wedgwood]], [[Free Masons]], [[Cryptography|secret codes]], [[radiotelephone|radio-telephones]], [[cosmic background radiation]] and—finally – [[radio astronomy]], which listens to "Echoes of the Past".
# "Photo Finish" – Another series of discoveries examined by Burke includes [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], the [[disappearing elephant scare of 1867]], billiard balls, [[celluloid]] as a substitute for ivory, false teeth that explode, [[gun cotton]], double shot sound of a bullet, [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[shock wave]], [[aerodynamics]], [[nuclear bombs]], [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativity]], Einstein's selenium, [[talkies|movie talkies]], the [[valve audio amplifier|vacuum tube amplifier]], radio, [[Railroad#History|railroad's use of wood]], [[coal tar]], [[gas lighting|gas lights]], [[creosote]], rubber, the [[Zeppelin]], the [[automobile]], and finally how Adeline [[Vulcanization|vulcanise]]s tires.
# "Separate Ways" – Burke shows how to get from sugar to [[atomic weapons]] by two totally independent paths. The first involves [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]], [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist societies]], [[Sampson Lloyd II]], [[wire]], [[suspension bridges]], [[Galvanization#Zinc coatings|galvanised wire]], settlement of the [[Wild West]], [[barbed wire]], canned corn, and [[cadmium]]. The second path involves [[sweet tea]], [[rum]], a [[double boiler]], the steam engine, [[Matthew Boulton]], English currency, the [[pantograph]], [[electroplating]], and [[cathode ray tubes]].
# "High Times" – The connection between [[polyethylene]] and [[Big Ben]] is a few degrees of separation, so let us recount them: polyethylene, [[radar]], soap, artificial dyes, [[color perception]], [[tapestries]], Far East goods, fake lacquer furniture, search for shorter route to Japan, [[Henry Hudson#1607 and 1608 voyages|Hudson in Greenland]], the discovery of plentiful whales, printing the Bible, [[Mercator map]], [[Martin Luther]]'s protest, star tables, Earth as a flattened sphere, and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]'s clock which of course leads to Big Ben.
# "Deja Vu" – James Burke provides evidence that history does repeat itself by examining the likes of [[black and white movie]]s, [[conquistadors]], [[Incas|Peruvian Incas]], [[small pox]], settlements that look like Spain's cities, the gold abundance ending up in [[Belgium]], Antwerp, colony [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], the practice of [[buried treasure|burying treasure]] to avoid pirates, [[Port Royal]]'s pirates, earthquakes, the [[College of William and Mary]], [[military discipline]], [[Alexander Humboldt]]'s observation on the environment, [[Ratzel]]'s superstate ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and [[Karl Haushofer|Haushofer]]'s world domination.
# "New Harmony" – A dream of utopia is followed from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] to Singapore, from the [[transistor]] to its most important element, [[germanium]], to [[Ming vase]]s and cobalt fakes (which contribute to the blue in blue tiles used in special Islamic places), and [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics in Byzantium]], the [[donation of Constantine]], [[Portuguese discoveries#Celestial navigation|Portuguese navigation by stars]], the [[History of Brazil#Beginnings of Brazil|"discovery" of Brazil]], [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|Holland's tolerance]], diamond merchants, [[optics]], [[microscopes]], beasts of science, [[Frankenstein's monster]], and finally [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony.]]
# "Hot Pickle" – Burke starts out in a [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|spice market in Istanbul]] where you can find hot pickle, recounts the [[Byzantium#History|taking of Constantinople by the Turks]] in 1453, follows the trail of pepper, tea, and [[opium]] and the exploitation of addicts, moves to the jungles of [[Java]], then to [[zoos]], the [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|use of canaries]] as carbon monoxide detectors, how [[George Stephenson]] used his consolation prize to build a [[locomotive]], which led to the [[Monitor and Merrimack|battle between the'' Monitor'' and the ''Merrimack'']]. Next we visit a sea island off the coast of South Carolina, where children of slaves are schooled. By the way, they picked cotton, which leads us to [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and [[air conditioning]]. [[Georgia Cayvan]]'s glass dress leads to the [[Neodymium laser|neodymium glass laser]], (which was used in the [[Gulf War]]). And the armed switch for firing a missile is also called a "hot pickle".
# "The Big Spin" is what [[The Big Spin|California's lottery TV show]] is called. And lottery being a game of chance, from here Burke takes us through [[Alexander Fleming]]'s chance discovery of [[penicillin]], to [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s observation that contaminated water is related to health, to [[Schliemann]]'s search for the [[City of Troy]], the theft of a discovered treasure, and to Virchow's criminology. From there we proceed to [[anthropology]], the classification of life forms, [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Mortality rate|statistics of mortality]], [[life expectancy]], [[Statistics#Statistical methods|statistical math]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]'s [[carbonated water]], the [[soda fountain]], [[petroleum oil]], some French fossil hunters, [[seismology]], and impossible-to-predict earthquakes.
# "Bright Ideas" – [[gin and tonic]] was invented to combat malaria in [[British colonies]] like [[Java]], which leads us to [[Geneva]], where cleanliness is an obsession. Here, [[tonic water]] was sealed with a disposable bottle cap, and [[disposable razor|razors became disposable]], leading us to [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s steel, invaluable for making [[clock]] springs. We take a little trip through [[lighthouses]], the education of orphans, [[psycho-physics]], the law of the [[just noticeable difference]], which is the idea behind [[stellar magnitude]]s, which leads us to discovering the [[size of the universe]].
# "Making Waves" – a [[permanent wave]] in ladies' hair is aided by [[curlers]], and this leads us to explore [[borax]], taking us to Switzerland, [[Johann Sutter]]'s scam, and [[Sutter's Mill]], and that means the discovery of gold leading to the 1848 [[California gold rush]]. Americans then cut into the English tea market with the aide of the ''[[Clipper|Yankee Clipper]]'', which played a big role in the gold rush. A fungus from America created the [[Irish potato famine]], resulting in the importing of corn, but laws prevented the Yankee clippers from being used until it was too late to save Ireland. Finally, the laws were changed, leading to franking fraud, which was overcome by special printing of postage stamps, which gave us [[wallpaper]], and a thickening agent, leading us to the [[Canal du Midi]], the [[American War of Independence|American war for independence]], resettlement in Scotland, [[Highland Clearances|highlanders]] in Nova Scotia and—finally—the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].
# "Routes" – [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], a sick English lawyer, recuperates sipping wine and contributes the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] to help fix farming problems. Farm production is not going so well in France, either. [[François Quesnay]] (doctor of King Louis XV's mistress) suggests a solution based on his complete misunderstanding of English farming techniques. ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' was his erroneous idea. It also got the people to demand social ''laissez-faire''. His inciting the public's rebellion against the [[French monarchy|monarchy]] led to France's invasion of Geneva. The [[French Revolution]] led to personal exploration of the senses. Berlin doctor Müller reasoned that each sense does a different job and the nervous system analyses what the senses are telling one. Helmholtz's pupil, Hertz, discovered that sound and electricity have a wave-like nature in common. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] takes this a step further by sending and receiving signals very long distances across the earth. The [[BBC]] realised that the radio waves were reflected by the ionosphere, and Hess was the first to suggest that the ionization was due to "Hess rays" later related to solar activity. But [[World War II]] started and [[adding machines]] were needed to aim artillery, so [[digital computing]] was invented. Thus was enabled the [[GPS]] which tells travelers their "Routes".
# "One Word" – The one word that changed everything was "[[filioque]]", but we must make a trip to [[Constantinople]], visit the [[Renaissance]], meet [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]], explore [[abbreviations]], learn about [[Italic type|Italic print]], which resulted in an overload of books, requiring the development of a cataloguing system, which was complicated for those seeking education, where [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] was innovating with pictorial textbooks. And that brings us to church intolerance, [[James Watt]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[cerium]], the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Gauss's mathematics, and [[cultural anthropology]].
# "Sign Here" – [[Murphy's Law]] says you need insurance from [[Lloyd's of London]], so pack your bags to study [[international law]] and protect yourself from piracy by calculating the probability. You better study Pascal's math for that, but you might find yourself jailed for [[free thinking]]. While you are in jail, study some [[sign language]], or at least learn to speak better than [[Eliza Doolittle]]. [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]]'s waveform recordings lead you to the telephone, the invention of [[shorthand]], the [[radiometer]], gas flow, the [[Wright brothers]]' aeroplane, [[lubrication]], [[ball bearings]] and a [[ballpoint pen]] so you can "Sign Here".
# "Better Than the Real Thing"  starts in the 1890s with bicycles and [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and then takes a look at [[boots]], [[zippers]], [[sewing machines]], and infinitesimal difference. Speaking of small, we look at microscopic [[Microorganism|germs]], [[polarized light]], sugar, coal, iron, microbubbles, the [[spectroscope]], [[night vision]], [[beriberi]] resulting from [[polished rice]], chickens, war rationing, and finally, we arrive at [[Vitamin pill|vitamins in a pill]].
# "Flexible Response" is a whimsical look at the myth of the [[English longbow]], [[Robin Hood]], sheep, the need to drain land with [[windmills]], the effect of [[compound interest]], [[decimal fractions]] (wrongly pointing to the USA not Russia as the first country with [[decimal currency]], in fact USA did not exist at the time of Russian decimalisation in 1704), increased [[productivity]], the [[Erie Canal]], railroads, [[telegraphs]], [[department stores]], [[Quaker Oats]], X-ray diagnostics, [[biofeedback]], and [[servo control]] systems in a [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft.

===''Connections³'' (1997)===
# "Feedback" – Electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by [[Claude Bernard]], whose vivisection experiments kick off animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there that are using [[Matthew Maury]]'s data on wind and currents transmitted by the radio telegraph, invented by [[Samuel Morse]], who is also a painter whose hero is [[Washington Allston]], who spends time in Italy with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who comes to [[Malta]] and spies for the governor [[Alexander Ball]], who saved Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s skin so he can go head over heels for [[Emma Hamilton]] in Naples, resulting in an illegitimate son. Emma became notable in the [[James Graham (sexologist)#The Celestial Bed|Electrico-Magnetico Celestial Bed]], where you go regain your fertility through electricity, and you can get more whisky thanks to [[Joseph Black]], who determined the latent heat of vaporisation in steam. [[James Watt]] borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper. The paper is used for decorating walls by [[William Morris]],  who is a socialist with [[Annie Besant]], who is a vegetarian just like the [[Seventh-day Adventists]]. And we end up with [[W.K. Kellogg]]'s cornflakes.
# "What's in a Name?" – Remember the cornflakes from last episode? Because corncobs make adhesives to bond [[carborundum]] discovered by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs, silicon carbide is also then used as protection against armour-piercing shells developed to hit tanks that start life as American tractors, which use diesel engines developed from funding from [[Krupp]], who inspired Bismarck's welfare scheme based on [[Adolphe Quetelet|Quetelet's]] statistics that inspired the [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], whose [[punch cards]] were used to rivet the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], the monster ship that laid the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] insulated with [[gutta-percha]] used to manufacture golf balls for factory managers in industrial Scotland, where James Watt had a run-in with [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]], whose protegee was James Macie, also called [[James Smithson]], who caused all the row in the capitol building, so the money got used to set up a world-renowned institution named after James Macie's new family name, which was Smithson: The institution known as the [[Smithsonian]].
# "Drop the Apple" – At the Smithsonian, we learn of electric crystals that help Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discover what they call radium, and then Langevin uses the piezoelectric crystal to develop sonar that helps save Liberty ships (from German U-boats) put together with welding techniques using acetylene made with carbon arcs, also working the arc lights with clockwork regulators built by Foucault, whose pendulum helps him to take pictures of solar eclipses. Also thanks to ash from seaweed, [[interchangeable parts]] for clocks, the world of opera, and gurus, we get Einstein's theory of the gravity effect, which means Newton's universe is gone and you can drop the apple.
# "An Invisible Object" – Black holes in space, seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]], brought into space with hydrazine fuel, which was a byproduct of fungicides for French vines, fuelled by quarantine conventions and money orders, [[American Express]] and [[Buffalo Bill]], Vaudeville and French battles, [[Joan of Arc]] and the Inquisition, Jews welcomed by Turks, who lost to Maltese knights with surgeons trained on pictures by [[Titian]], in [[Augsburg]], where goldsmiths made French money to pay for tobacco. That triggered logarithms and slide rules made by clock makers, who also made pressure cookers that sterilised French beer kept cool by refrigerators that were also used to freeze meat and chill down paraffin wax for making objects invisible.
# "Life is No Picnic" – Instant coffee gets off the ground in World War II and Jeeps lead to nylons and stocking machines smashed by [[Luddites]], who were defended by [[Lord Byron]], who meets [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Turkey, avoiding the same blockade that inspires the "Star-Spangled Banner", which was really an English song all about a Greek poet discovered by a publisher whose son-in-law is pals with [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] of chronology fame, whose military boss, Maurice, inspires [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]], father of the runaway [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], whose teacher [[René Descartes]]' mechanical universe inspires the book about brains by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Willis]], which is illustrated by the architect of St. Paul's, [[Christopher Wren]], who dabbles in investments like [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s Louisiana scam that ruins France, and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and later the French finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], whose daughter is the opinionated [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|de Stael]], whose romantic pals get [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] looking into jellyfish so he can defend [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. This demonstrates that "Life is No Picnic".
# "Elementary Stuff" – [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who studied beetles, [[Oliver Lodge]] and telegraphy, a radio designed by [[Reginald Fessenden]], which was used by banana growers, studied by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]], who got the Swiss to use stamps on postcards with cartoons of Gothic houses of parliament, which in turn had been inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s Romantic movement, inspired by fake Scottish poems. The exiled Scots escaped to North Carolina, producing turpentine, which helped make Chinese lacquer on tinplate, which is for what [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] had hoped. French navy decorator [[Pierre Paul Puget]], who paints pictures of locations where barometers are the subject of investigation. The weather experimenter, whose brother's writing turns on Swift, whose pal Berkeley has visual theories that Young confirms while decoding ancient Egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by French balloonists. The American balloons are used for spying by [[Allan Pinkerton]] and his intrepid agent [[James McParland]], who becomes famous in England because of [[Conan Doyle]].
# "A Special Place" – Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffries]] of Leicester University in England develops DNA profiling and schlieren photography used by [[Theodore von Karman]] to study aerodynamics and [[Anthony Fokker]]'s airborne machine guns and the [[Red Baron]] and geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s romantic ideas that start in Italy and paintings of actors and lighthouses and the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] and Spanish gold and [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] and [[William Cheselden]]'s skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing aficionados who write books and [[Charles Cotton]] and sceptical wine-drinkers called [[Michel Eyquem]], and [[Edward Jenner]]'s cure for smallpox and [[J.J. Audubon]] and American bird painters and devious Russian real estate deals, and as a result in 1872, America gets a special place, the first national park, Yellowstone.
# "Fire from the Sky" –   Due to [[continental drift]] and [[Alfred Wegener]]'s passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of [[King Arthur]], whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval [[courtly love]] answers to adultery, which were in turn inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical [[Catharism|Cathars]], who lived next to the mystical [[Christian Kabbalah|cabalists]] who were fascinated with mystic numbers that spark [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Pico of Mirandola]]'s interest in Hebrew, which then brings trouble for [[Johann Reuchlin]], not helped by his nephew, the [[Protestant]] [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], who had a feud with [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]], who rewrites the work of [[Copernicus]]. Osiander's Italian pal, Dr. [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], who cures the asthmatic [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], executed for helping [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], whose lover, the explosive-bearing [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], ends up in Scandinavia with a friend of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], whose assistant, [[Willem Blaeu]], makes maps updated in the first true atlas by the Englishman Dudley, working in Italy for [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], who got opera started, which was a rave success, especially with the French [[Cardinal Mazarin]], whose library inspired [[Samuel Pepys|the secretary of the English navy]], which eventually buys French [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], after which [[Canning|Gamble]] gets the patent for canned food that feeds explorers like [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], who transplanted rubber trees to [[Sri Lanka]]. As a result of all that, we have rubber to mix with gasoline to make [[napalm]], which is "Fire from the Sky".
# "Hit the Water" – Thanks to napalm, made with [[palm oil]], also used for [[margarine]], stiffened with a process using [[kieselguhr]] that comes from [[plankton]] living in currents studied by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Ballot]] before observing the [[Doppler effect]] that caused [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] to measure the speed of light. Fizeau's father-in-law's friend, [[Prosper Mérimée]], who wrote "[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]"...&amp;nbsp;his friend, [[Anthony Panizzi]], who works at the British Museum, opened to house the collection of [[Hans Sloane]], who treats Lady Montague's smallpox before she sees Turkish tulips, first drawn by Gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with France, which was the first to develop military music and choreography, used in a London show by [[John Gay]], whose friend Arbuthnot does statistics that impress the Dutch mathematician who knows [[Voltaire]], who hears from the worm-slicing [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who stars in the story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Judge Hoffman]], who tries German nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the [[YMCA]] and the man who started the [[Red Cross]], who need a way to figure out blood types, surgical stitching and the perfusion pump invented by [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to [[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']], [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']], and the German invasion of Norway and the Allied commandos whose mission was to "Hit the Water".
# "In Touch" – Starting from an attempt for cheaper fusion power using superconductivity, which was discovered by Onnes, with liquid gas provided by [[Louis-Paul Cailletet]], who carried out experiments on a [[Eiffel Tower|tower]] built by [[Gustave Eiffel]], who also built the [[Statue of Liberty]] with its famous poem by the Jewish activist [[Emma Lazarus]], helped by [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Oliphant]], whose boss Elgin was the son of the man who stole the [[Elgin Marbles]] and sold them with the help of royal painter [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose colleague [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] had an assistant whose wife's lodger was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who charted the [[Gulf Stream]] with a thermometer [[Fahrenheit]] borrowed from [[Ole Rømer]], whose friend [[Jean Picard|Picard]] surveyed Versailles and provided the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspired [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel]] to write the book on gardening that was read by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], who hired the Scottish stonemason [[Thomas Telford]], whose idea for [[London Bridge]] was turned down by Thomas Young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do Hertz's electricity waves, with which Helmholtz prods a frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, Klages, analyses handwriting so individual post codes have to be capital letters to get your mail to a jungle village to keep you "In Touch".

All three ''Connections'' documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.

Burke also wrote a series of ''Connections'' articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and published a book of the same name (1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.

Burke produced another documentary series called ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original ''Connections''.

''{{YouTube|user=ArtOfTheProblem|title=Art of the Problem}}'' is a video series launched in 2011 on [[Kickstarter.com]] that was inspired by James Burke's ''Connections''. However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.

The '''conservation and restoration of musical instruments''' is an action done by [[conservator-restorer]]s trained to preserve or protect historical and current musical instruments.

Musical instrument conservation, at least by the date of the earliest reference acquired, originates from 1862 when “a letter was written by [[Antonio Stradivari]], who not only 
repaired his own instruments but also those of other makers, for [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200155598/default.html Count Cesare Castelbarco] about how
to conserve his many Stradivari instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollens|first1=Stewart|page=279|title=Stradivari|date=2010|publisher=Google Books|location=online|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dFwvjj--MsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Conservation practices of musical instruments follow the same guidelines as the numerous other artifacts in museum collections. During conservation, it is important to document the pre-conservation state and then the progress after those conservation actions have been completed. In order to protect musical instruments for the future, it is best to keep the collection in the most climate-controlled area.

It is important to realize that even though many instruments have to be rebuilt after a certain period of time has passed, it is acceptable to play them if they are supervised by a musical instrument conservator. Musical instrument conservation is unique because the artifacts are played and they produce sound. These instruments were historically made over the centuries to entertain all kinds of people, from royalty to the average person.

==Background==
There are many similarities between musical instrument conservation and art work protection. Like a conservator working to restore the color saturation of the water lilies in a Claude Monet painting, conservators must keep in mind the instrument maker’s integrity when cleaning or restoring any type of musical instrument (for example, luthiers create guitars and violins for guitarists or violinists), as well as the standardized policies or ethics of art conservation. According to the Code of Ethics, “II. All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for the cultural property, its unique character and significance, and the people or person who created it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core=documents/code-of-ehtics-and-guidelines-for-practice/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VTvINSFViko|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic Works and Artistic Works|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Both art conservation and musical instrument conservation require a lot of attention to detail, patience, and respect for the item or artist(s). The conservator should also be highly trained in the medium in which these items were created. For example, wood preservation or acrylic on canvas.

In general, art works are static and not moving whereas musical instruments are basically an active art tool for producing the sounds notated on sheet music in various [[Key (music)|keys]] or [[tempo]]s. Although some art objects may have more than one use and move periodically from its home institution to another museum on loan (besides providing cultural satisfaction), instruments are subject to: travel or wear and tear consistently due to continual playing. Musical instruments create art by producing sound because the human hand touches their skins, strings, [[Bow (music)|bows]], [[Fingerboard|fret board]] or [[Musical keyboard|keys.]] Musical instruments are generally used on a regular basis, during recitals and concerts by all levels of musicians.

An instrumentalist needs to keep in mind how to play their instrument carefully so that they can preserve the integrity of the instrument. That being stated, each musician performs with an instrument differently, creating their own personality and take on the capabilities of that particular instrument (ex. Louis Armstrong and his trumpet). In a sense, the partnership between instrumentalist and instrument defines them both. “Players demand certain kinds of physical responses from an instrument, and players and listeners alike have certain preferences about the tone produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Barbara|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|publisher=Elsevier|pages=145|ref=Quadrant IV- Lifetime of the Cultural Object. Lexington, KY}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Despite how long musical instruments should last, it is important to try to maintain their playable conditions as long as possible. Similarly to automobiles that have been used on a daily basis over the years, musical instruments do not sound the same or work in the same manner that they once did when they were new. Parts wear out and at times just need to be replaced. On a side note, the average lifespan of instruments depends on the classification of them: “[[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] or [[Brass instrument|brass]] instruments last about twenty years, while pianos last about 100 years, and string instruments for a maximum of 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Arthur|title=Conservation and Musical Instrument Making|url=http://www.art-robb.co.uk/cons.html|website=Arthur Robb- Luthier|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;" With proper conservation techniques used on instruments, they will be able to last longer than their projected lifespans.

Some music composed during the 18th century by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was for the [[harpsichord]], and if this music is to be historically understood it must be heard on an instrument of the original time period.  The Smithsonian has maintained a harpsichord that some of the resident curators can periodically play. This can be seen via the short YouTube video entitled, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1LCWOHmMQw&amp;feature=youtu.be “Play it Again.”]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithsonian|title=Play it Again|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1LCWOHmMQw&amp;feature=youtu.be|website=Youtube|publisher=December 10, 2013|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these Mozart compositions could be played on a piano, they would not sound the same as a harpsichord when a musician performs the piece.

[[File:Rosewood Albert System Clarinet.png|thumb|Late 19th Century Rosewood Clarinet]]
Environmental obligations exist for both musical instrument creators and conservators. This is because the materials used in instrument creation, like wood, can be on the endangered species list. “Many species of rosewood and ebony are endangered, but the wood is still easily purchased.’ ‘Some timbers and materials used by [[luthier]]s has legal restrictions, especially when crossing international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Arthur|title=Conservation and Musical Instrument Making|url=http://www.art-robb.co.uk/cons.html|website=Arthur Robb- Luthier|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” There appears to be a mission to conserve both art or cultural artifacts and environmental conservation in the realm of musical instrument conservation.

==General care of musical instruments==
According to the Heritage Preservation’s Caring for Your Family Treasures: A Concise guide to caring for your cherished belongings by Jane S. Long and Richard W. Long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following eight steps are something to remember when trying to preserve one’s instrument(s):

* “Avoid placing high tension on stringed (including keyboard) instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “Avoid sudden increases or decreases in string tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “Move pianos only on dollies and when you have enough people to do the job comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* Preserve the natural patina on brass instruments; don’t handle them with bare hands or polish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “Keep instruments in rooms with relative humidity at about 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “If you play wooden-bore wind instruments, warm them up and play them in gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “Clear the moisture from wind instruments immediately after they are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;” 
* “Do not oil or polish the surfaces of a wooden instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== ''Preventive conservation'' ==

{{Empty section|date=May 2015}}

== Environmental considerations ==

In some museums, the climate controlled system in the galleries or entire architecture of the institution may need to be revamped or even replaced (depending on the age of the institution). A collections manager, or another employee from the collections department, should check to see what should be upgraded in the climate controlled system by walking around the museum and checking the status of the collection. It is their duty, along with the artifact conservators, to keep the collection safe. “Since there are over 8,000 different combinations of climate control design choices in the commercial marketplace today, it is a team process which can be divided into the three following steps: classify envelope, identify heat loads, and perform moisture inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conrad|first1=Earnest A.|title=The Realistic Preservation Environment|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/environmental-control/realistic-preservation-environment.html|website=The National Archives|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” If a space is too warm, wooden instruments may warp.

== Climate Control ==

Since musical instruments are compiled of many organic materials such as: wood, metal, or plastic; it makes it difficult to preserve them if they are constantly on display in a museum. “Paper, leather, wood, natural fibers, and other organic materials absorb moisture; if they are kept in non-climate-controlled environments, serious conservation problems arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=Andrew|title=To Play or Not to Play: The Ethics of Musical Instrument Conservation|journal=V &amp; A Conservation Journal|date=1995|volume=15|pages=12–15|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play-or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation/|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” These dilemmas could include corrosion or buckling. That is why it is important to keep humidity down and at a constant temperature. Remember; “Technical assistance from specialists in heating and ventilating engineering, the museum environment, and the conservation of musical instruments should always be sought before any major changes are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Light limitation ==

	Similarly to how sunlight could damage the human eye, direct sunlight is harmful to artifacts too. Light makes colors fade and breaks down organic materials quickly. It is generally best not to place any artifact in a collection in direct light, whether it is natural or artificial. “Light damage is a commonly identified problem in collections, and is the subject of vast literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Storage ==

	Generally speaking, if an instrument is hung on a wall for display, it probably is rather stable because it is not moving. For musical instruments that “belong to a study or teaching collection, or… simply be in a drawer that experiences a great deal of in-and-out movement during examination of other specimens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” they are more at risk of being damaged because more people are interacting with them. Therefore, it is best to create limits for either human interaction or accessibility. Even easy-gliding and organized shelving could come in handy.

== Air Quality ==

	There are always pollutants in the air of museums located in a cityscape, but for rural museums, the amount could be less. The following are four of Barclay's steps &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect a museum’s collection from harmful air. First, “install air filters in the building.” Second, “absorbent cloth, charcoal and similar materials can be placed in storage cabinets or display cases to absorb pollutants.” Third, “keeping metal artifacts dry retards corrosion.” Lastly, “protective coatings are occasionally applied to metal instruments.”

== Pest Control ==
[[File:Dead-Wood Borer Moth (Scolecocampa liburna).jpg|thumb|Dead-Wood Borer Moth (Scolecocampa liburna)]]
Pest control is more closely associated with climate control measures because one effects the other. Many instruments are made of wood, including: guitars, violins, violas, pianos, harpsichords, banjos, cellos, basses, etc. Therefore, wood eating insects could damage them if left in a dark, damp, and drafty space. A careful way to get rid of the infestation is through “asphyxiation by carbon dioxide or nitrogen [because they] are the preferred methods, although some work still has to be done on the effects of changes in moisture content of artifacts during treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==''Conservation practices''==

{{Empty section|date=May 2015}}

== Factors for functional restoration ==

According to Robert Barclay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following are a list of the top five reasons for functional restoration. First, a restoration can be completed if “the instrument is mass-produced.” Second, if “the instrument has been previously restored and most ephemera has been lost.” Third, with a little bit of work from a conservator, “the instrument can easily be put into working condition.” Fourth, “the original function can be reestablished.” Lastly, if “the instrument is in sturdy condition,” then it could be conserved.

== Factors against functional restoration ==
Barclay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also mentions some explanations for not functionally restoring musical instruments and the top five reasons are as follows. First a musical instrument should not be conserved if “the instrument is unique.” Second, work should not be completed if “the original ephemeral features will be lost or altered.” Third, the way the instrument could be played is unknown or “the function is obscure and unlikely to be determined as a result of restoration.” Fourth, “the condition of the instrument is such that an accurate achievement of its original quality of function is unlikely.” Lastly, if “the function is so well understood that no new information is likely to be gained.”

== Determining Playability ==
Playability depends on the overall strength of the architecture of the instrument as well as the musician’s interpretation or technique of a musical score. There are always two sides to every story: those for restoring musical instruments and those that are against. “The opponents of restoration argue that the truly authentic instrument is a reproduction of that relic, to the best of present knowledge and ability, in a state equivalent to what it was when new.’ ‘A great deal of progress could result from making a distinction between “soundability” and playability, where the former can often be achieved without any prerequisite restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Therefore, who in the cultural artifact conservation world draws the line between “soundability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” and playability?

== Classification Systems ==

There are around a handful of different classification systems known for musical instruments. From the 1960s, Curt Sachs and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel’s system for the Classification of Musical Instruments is divided into two main sections with several subcategories. The first section is “Idiophones- musical instruments in which vibrating solid material (ex. stone, wood, and metal) is used to produce sound and are differentiated according to how you make it vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” The subcategories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Concussion
# Friction
# Percussion 
# Plucked
# Scraped
# Shaken
# Stamping
# Stamped.

The second main section is “Membranophones- musical instruments that have vibrating membranes or skin that produce sound and are classified according to the instrument’s shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;” The subcategories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Kettle drums
# Tubular drums
# Friction drums
# Mirlitons
# Frame drums/Pot drums/Ground drums.

== Condition reporting before and after restoration with photographs &amp; other documentation ==

	Similarly to the document(s) that a museum registrar might use to catalog an artifact into a collection, it is important to keep the proper paperwork during the conservation process being done on a musical instrument. (If interested, there is also an example of a museum condition report right [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060529/http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf here] from the Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condition Report Form|url=http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf|website=The Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060529/http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally by taking before and after camera shots, it helps to document the steps taken by the conservator (or the rest of the conservation staff) while working on an instrument and the progress made during the duration of the project. A checklist could also help conservators stay focused on the task at hand trying to restore a particular musical instrument. But each plan is different for the conservation process depending on how severely wounded the instrument in question may be.

'''Copper loss''' is the term often given to [[heat]] produced by [[electrical current]]s in the [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s of [[transformer]] windings, or other electrical devices. Copper losses are an undesirable transfer of [[energy]], as are [[core loss]]es, which result from [[induced current]]s in adjacent components. The term is applied regardless of whether the windings are made of [[copper]] or another conductor, such as [[aluminium]]. Hence the term '''winding loss''' is often preferred.  The term [[load loss]] is closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.

==Calculations==
Copper losses result from [[Joule heating]] and so are also referred to as "I squared R losses", in reference to [[Joule's first law|Joule's First Law]]. This states that the energy lost each [[second]], or [[Power (physics)|power]], increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the current through the windings and in [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductors.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} \propto I^2 \cdot R&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the current flowing in the conductor and R the resistance of the conductor. With I in [[ampere]]s and R in ohms, the calculated power loss is given in [[watt]]s.

Joule heating has a [[coefficient of performance]] of 1.0, meaning that every 1 watt of electrical power is converted to 1 Joule of heat. Therefore, the energy lost due to copper loss is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Copper Loss} = I^2 \cdot R \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time in [[second]]s the current is maintained. 

==Effect of frequency==
For low-frequency applications, the power lost can be minimized by employing conductors with a large cross-sectional area, made from low-[[resistivity]] metals.

With high-frequency currents, the [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and [[skin effect]] cause the current to be unevenly distributed across the conductor, increasing its effective resistance, and making loss calculations more difficult.

[[Litz wire]] is a type of wire constructed to force the current to be distributed uniformly, thereby reducing Joule heating.

==Reducing copper loss==
Among other measures, the electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial [[induction motor]] can be improved by reducing the electrical losses in the [[stator]] windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper).

'''Cosmic infrared background ''' is  [[infrared radiation]] caused by [[Cosmic dust|stellar dust]].

==History==

Recognizing the cosmological importance of the darkness of the night sky ([[Olbers' paradox]]) and the first speculations on an [[extragalactic background light]] dates back to the first half of the 19th century. Despite its importance, the first attempts were made only in the 1950-60s to derive the value of the visual background due to galaxies, at that time based on the integrated starlight of these stellar systems. In the 1960s the absorption of starlight by dust was already taken into account, but without considering the re-emission of this absorbed energy in the [[infrared]]. At that time [[Jim Peebles]] pointed out, that in a [[Big Bang]]-created Universe there must have been a cosmic infrared background (CIB) - different from the [[cosmic microwave background]] - that can account for the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.

In order to produce today's [[metallicity]], early galaxies must have been significantly more powerful than they are today. In the early CIB models the absorption of starlight was neglected, therefore in these models the CIB peaked between 1-10μm wavelengths. These early models have already shown correctly that the CIB was most probably fainter than its foregrounds, and so it was very difficult to observe. Later the discovery and observations of high luminosity infrared galaxies in the vicinity of the [[Milky Way]] showed, that the peak of the CIB is most likely at longer wavelengths (around 50μm), and its full power could be ~1-10% of that of the [[CMB]].

As [[Martin Harwit]] emphasized, the CIB is very important in the understanding of some special astronomical objects, like [[quasars]] or [[ultraluminous infrared galaxies]], which are very bright in the infrared. He also pointed out, that the CIB cause a significant attenuation for very high energy electrons, protons and gamma-rays of the [[cosmic radiation]] through inverse [[Compton scattering]], photopion and electron-positron pair production.

In the early 1980s there were only upper limits available for the CIB. The real observations of the CIB began after the era of astronomical satellites working in the infrared, started by the [[Infrared Astronomy Satellite]] (IRAS), and followed by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO) and by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Exploration of the CIB was continued by the [[Herschel Space Observatory]], launched in 2009.

The Spitzer wide area surveys have detected anisotropies in the CIB.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Kate. [http://www.tgdaily.com/space-features/63904-nasa-spots-glow-of-universes-first-objects "NASA spots glow of universe's first objects."] ''TG Daily'', June 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary on the history of CIB research can be found in the review papers by M.G. Hauser and E. Dwek (2001)&lt;ref&gt;

== Origin of the cosmic infrared background ==

One of the most important questions about the CIB is the source of its energy. In the early models the CIB was built up from the [[redshifted]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of the galaxies found in our cosmic neighborhood. However, these simple models could not reproduce the observed features of the CIB. In the baryonic material of the Universe there are two sources of large amounts of energy: nuclear fusion and gravitation.

Nuclear fusion takes place inside the stars, and we can really see this light redshifted: this is the main source of the [[cosmic ultraviolet- and visual background]].  However, a significant amount of this starlight is not observed directly. Dust in the host galaxies can absorb it and re-emit it in the infrared, contributing to the CIB. Although most of today's galaxies contain little dust (e.g. [[elliptical galaxies]] are practically dustless), there are some special stellar systems even in our vicinity which are extremely bright in the infrared and at the same time faint (often almost invisible) in the optical. These [[ultraluminous infrared galaxies]] (ULIRGs) are just in a very active [[star formation]] period: they are just in a collision or in a merge with another galaxy. In the optical this is hidden by the huge amount of dust, and the galaxy is bright in the infrared due to the same reason. Galaxy collisions and mergers were more frequent in the cosmic past: the global [[star formation rate]] of the Universe peaked around [[redshift]] ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1...2, and was 10 to 50 times the average value today. These galaxies in the ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1...2 redshift range give 50 to 70 percent of the full brightness of the CIB.

Another important component of the CIB is the infrared emission by [[quasars]]. In these systems most of the [[gravitational potential energy]] of the matter falling into the central [[black hole]] is converted into [[X-rays]], which would escape unless they are absorbed by the dust torus of the [[accretion disc]]. This absorbed light is again re-emitted in the infrared, and in total gives about 20-30% of the full power of the CIB; however at some specific wavelengths this is the dominant source of CIB energy.

A hitherto unrecognised population of [[intergalactic stars]] have been shown to explain the CIB as well as the other elements of the [[diffuse extragalactic background radiation]]. If intergalactic stars were to account for all of the background anisotropy, it would require a very large population, but this is not excluded by observations and could in fact also explain a fair part of the [[dark matter]] problem as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6031v1.pdf|title=A measurement of the intrahalo light fraction with near-infrared background anisotropies |author=Cooray et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1411.pdf|title=On the Origin of Near-Infrared Extragalactic Background Light Anisotropy |author=Zemcov et.al. |publisher=Nature |date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foregrounds==

The most important foreground components of the CIB are the following:
*[[Zodiacal light|Zodiacal emission]]: the thermal emission of microscopic dust particles in the [[Solar System]] (from near- to mid-infrared)
*Thermal emission of small [[asteroids]] in the [[Solar System]] (from near- to mid-infrared)
*[[infrared cirrus|Galactic cirrus emission]] (far-infrared)
*Faint [[galaxy|galactic]] [[star]]s (in the [[near-infrared]], λ&lt;20μm)
*Infrared emission of [[Intracluster medium|intracluster dust]] in the [[Local Group]]
*The [[cosmic microwave background]] - although physically it is not a "foreground" - is also considered as an important contaminating source of emission at very long infrared wavelengths (λ&gt;300μm)

These components must be separated for a clear CIB detection.

== Observation of the cosmic infrared background ==

The detection of the CIB is both observationally and astrophysically very challenging. It has a very few characteristics which can be used to separate it from the foregrounds. One major point is, that the CIB must be isotropic, i.e. one has to measure the same CIB value all over the sky. It also lacks suspicious spectral features, since the final shape of its spectrum is the sum of the spectra of sources in the line of sight at various redshifts.

=== Direct detection ===

Direct measurements are simple, but very difficult. One just has to measure the total incoming power, and determine the contribution of each [[sky background]] component. The measurement has to be repeated in many directions to determine the contribution of the foregrounds. After the removal of all other components the remaining power - if it is the same constant value in any direction - is the CIB at that specific wavelength. In practice, one needs an instrument which is able to perform [[absolute photometry]], i.e. it has some mechanism to fully block incoming light for an accurate zero level determination ([[cold shutter]]). Since the instrument parts, including the shutter, have non-zero temperatures and emit in the infrared, this is a very difficult task.

The first, and still the most extensive, direct CIB measurements were performed by the [[DIRBE]] instrument of the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite. After the removal of the precisely determined [[zodiacal emission]] contribution (which was based on the measured annual variation) the remaining power at longer infrared wavelength contained basically two components: the CIB and the Galactic cirrus emission. The infrared surface brightness of the Galactic cirrus must correlate with the neutral hydrogen column densities, since they originate from the same, low density structure.  After the removal of the HI-correlated part, the remaining surface brightness was identified as the cosmic infrared background at 60, 100, 140 and 240μm. At shorter wavelengths the CIB level could not be correctly determined.

Later, short wavelength DIRBE measurements at 2.2 and 3.5μ were combined with the Two Micron Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]) source count data, and this led to the detection of the
CIB at these two wavelengths.

=== Fluctuation studies ===

Since the CIB is an accumulated light of individual sources there is always a somewhat different number of sources in different directions in the field of view of the observer. This cause a variation (fluctuation) in the total amount of observed incoming flux among the different line of sights. These fluctuations are traditionally described by the two dimensional [[autocorrelation function]], or by the corresponding [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] [[power spectrum]]. The detection of fluctuations is easier than the direct CIB measurements, since one does not need to determine the absolute photometric zero point - fluctuations can be derived from differential measurements. On the other hand, fluctuations do not provide an immediate information on the CIB brightness. The measured fluctuation amplitudes either has to be confronted with a CIB model that has a prediction for the fluctuation / absolute level ratio, or it has to be compared with integrated differential light levels of [[source counts]] at the same wavelength.

The power spectrum of the CIB is usually presented in a spatial frequency [arcmin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] vs. fluctuation power [Jy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] diagram. It is contaminated by the presence of the power spectrum of foreground components, so that the total power spectrum is:

''P(f) = Φ(f)x[P&lt;sub&gt;CIB&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;cirr&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;ze&lt;/sub&gt;(f) + P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(f)]''

where P(f), P&lt;sub&gt;CIB&lt;/sub&gt;(f), P&lt;sub&gt;cirr&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;ze&lt;/sub&gt;(f) and P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(f) are the total, CIB, [[infrared cirrus|Galactic cirrus]], zodiacal emission and noise (instrument noise) power spectrum components, respectively, and Φ is the power spectrum of the telescope's [[point spread function]].

For most of the infrared zodiacal emission fluctuation are negligible in the "cosmic windows", far from the [[ecliptic]] plane.&lt;ref&gt;

| volume=328|year=1997|pages=702–705|bibcode = 1997A&amp;A...328..702A
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the far-infrared the CIB power spectrum can be effectively used to separate it from its strongest foreground, the Galactic cirrus emission. The cirrus emission has a characteristic power spectrum of a power-law (that of a [[fractal]] spatial structure) ''P(f) = P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(f/f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''P'' is the fluctuation power at the spatial frequency ''f'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fluctuation power at the reference spatial frequency ''f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and α is the spectral index. α was found to be α≈-3, which is much steeper than the power spectrum of the CIB at low spatial frequencies. The cirrus component can be identified in the power spectrum at low spatial frequencies and then removed from the whole spatial frequency range. The remaining power spectrum - after a careful correction for instrument effects - should be that of the CIB.

Autocorrelation and power spectrum studies resulted in the CIB fluctuation amplitudes at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 12-100μm based on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]/DIRBE measurements, and later at 90 and 170μm, based on the observations of the ISOPHOT instrument of the [[Infrared Space Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Source counts ===
[[Source counts]] gives the most extensive picture about the sources building up the CIB. In a [[source count]] one tries to detect as many point/compact sources in a certain field of view as possible: this is usually done at multiple wavelengths and is often complemented by other data, e.g. photometry at visual or sub-millimeter wavelengths. In this way, one has information on the broad band spectral characteristics of the detected sources, too. The detected point sources have to be distinguished from other contaminating sources, e.g. minor bodies in the Solar System, Galactic stars and cirrus knots (local density enhancements in the Galactic cirrus emission).

Source counts were important tasks for the recent infrared missions like [[2MASS]] or the [[Infrared Space Observatory]] (ISO), and is still one of the most important questions the current and near future infrared space instruments (the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]). While ISO was able to resolve about 3-10% of the total CIB light into individual sources (depending on the wavelength), Spitzer measurements have already detected ~30% of the CIB as sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = H. Dole | title = Far-infrared Source Counts at 70 and 160 Microns in Spitzer Deep Surveys
 | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series
 | volume= 154 |year=2004| pages=87–92 
 | doi = 10.1086/422472| bibcode=2004ApJS..154...87D|arxiv = astro-ph/0406021
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this ratio is expected to be ~90% at some wavelengths with the [[Herschel Space Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = G. Lagache 
| title = Modeling infrared galaxy evolution using a phenomenological approach
| journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] 
| volume=338 |year=2003| pages=555–571

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source count results support the "fast evolution" galaxy models. In these models galaxies nowadays look significantly different than they were at z=1...2, when they were coming through an intense star-formation phase. The source count results exclude the "steady state" scenarios, where z=1...2 galaxies look similar to those we see today in our cosmic neighborhood.

{{confused|alternate history}}

'''Counterfactual history''', also sometimes referred to as '''virtual history''', is a form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer "[[wikt:what if|what if]]" questions known as [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," ''American Historical Review'' (2004) 109#3 pp. 845–858 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Black and MacRaild provide this definition: "It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Donald M. MacRaild|title=Studying History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQZeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=125|isbn=9780230364929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a [[literary genre]] which is variously called [[alternate history|alternative history]], [[speculative fiction|speculative history]], or hypothetical history.&lt;ref name = "Arnold" /&gt;

One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim "What would have happened had [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] drunk [[coffee]] instead of [[tea]] on the afternoon he committed suicide?", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual "What would have happened had Hitler died in the [[20 July plot|July 1944 assassination attempt]]?", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to [[World War II]]. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, [[Albert Speer|Speer]], [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.

==Development==
Although there are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.

An early example is ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' (1931) which features a contribution by [[Winston Churchill]] who examined what would have happened had [[Robert E. Lee]] won at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg |first=Winston |last=Churchill |authorlink=Winston Churchill |publisher=The Churchill Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132718/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional [[alternate history]] genre.

A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]]. In his 1964 book ''[[Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History]]'', Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History – Book Reviews ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228010214/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”&lt;ref name="eh.net"/&gt;

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of ''[[Plausible Worlds|Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences]]'' by the Cambridge sociologist [[Geoffrey Hawthorn]], who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederic |last=Smoler |title=Past Tense |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/past-tense |journal=American Heritage |date=September 1999 |volume=50 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work helped inspire ''[[Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals]]'' (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian [[Niall Ferguson]]. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as [[Marxism]], and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of [[What If? (essays)|"What If?"]] books edited by [[Robert Cowley]] presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about "how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time."&lt;ref name = "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/books/making-books-the-what-ifs-that-fascinate.html?src=pm|title=Making books: The 'What Ifs' that fascinate|last=Arnold|first=Martin|date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven [[globalization]] processes for almost a thousand years. From [[Song dynasty]] in China to [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither [[historical revisionism]] nor [[alternate history]].

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], whose alternate-history novel ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as "a useless exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/riceandsalt.htm|title=Kim Stanley Robinson: The Years of Rice and Salt – an infinity plus review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about [[causality]] in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's ''Virtual History in History and Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00090 |title=Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency |journal=History and Theory |volume=38 |number=2 |pages=264–276 |date=May 1999 |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1171466/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-83415-5 |doi=10.2277/0521834155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Richard J. Evans]] in his book ''Altered Pasts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/altered-pasts-counterfactuals-in-history-by-richard-j-evans/2012202.article|title=Altered Pasts: Counterfactuals in History, by Richard J.

'''Data science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract [[knowledge]] and insights from [[data]] in various forms, both structured and unstructured,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dhar | first1 = V. | title = Data science and prediction | doi = 10.1145/2500499 | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 56 | issue = 12 | pages = 64 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169933-data-science-and-prediction/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/12/the-key-word-in-data-science-is-not-data-it-is-science/ | title=The key word in "Data Science" is not Data, it is Science | publisher=Simply Statistics | date=2013-12-12 | author=Jeff Leek }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[data mining]].

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.&lt;ref name="Hayashi" /&gt; It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[information science]], and [[computer science]].

[[Turing award]] winner [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science ([[Empirical research|empirical]], [[Basic research|theoretical]], [[computational science|computational]] and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the [[information explosion|data deluge]].&lt;ref name="TansleyTolle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stewart Tansley|author2=Kristin Michele Tolle|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs_AQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Research|isbn=978-0-9825442-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BellHey2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=G.|last2=Hey|first2=T.|last3=Szalay|first3=A.|title=COMPUTER SCIENCE: Beyond the Data Deluge|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5919|year=2009|pages=1297–1298|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1170411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, when [[Harvard Business Review]] called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; the term "data science" became a [[buzzword]].  It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like [[business analytics]],&lt;ref name="GilPress" /&gt; [[business intelligence]], [[Predictive modelling|predictive modeling]], and [[statistics]].  Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing [[Hans Rosling]], featured in a [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgq0l 2011 BBC documentary] with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/business/03stream.html|title=When the Data Struts Its Stuff|first=Natasha|last=Singer|date=2011-04-02|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nate Silver]] referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.&lt;ref name="NateSilver" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;   In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/data-science-terminology.html|title=Why the term "data science" is flawed but useful|last=Warden|first=Pete|date=2011-05-09|work=O'Reilly Radar|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.&lt;ref name="GilPress" /&gt; To its discredit, however, many data-science and [[big data|big-data]] projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/01/are-you-setting-your-data-scientists-up-to-fail|title=Are You Setting Your Data Scientists Up to Fail?|date=2018-01-25|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/16839/70-of-big-data-projects-in-uk-fail-to-realise-full-potential|title=70% of Big Data projects in UK fail to realise full potential|website=www.consultancy.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://analytics-magazine.org/the-data-economy-why-do-so-many-analytics-projects-fail/|title=The Data Economy: Why do so many analytics projects fail? – Analytics Magazine|date=2014-07-07|work=Analytics Magazine|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/data-science-4-reasons-failing-deliver.html|title=Data Science: 4 Reasons Why Most Are Failing to Deliver|website=www.kdnuggets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "data science" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a substitute for [[computer science]] by [[Peter Naur]] in 1960. Naur later introduced the term "[[datalogy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naur|first1=Peter|title=The science of datalogy|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 July 1966|volume=9|issue=7|pages=485|doi=10.1145/365719.366510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Naur published ''Concise Survey of Computer Methods'', which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications.

In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/|title=A Very Short History Of Data Science|first=Gil|last=Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the term was introduced in a roundtable discussion by Chikio Hayashi.&lt;ref name="Hayashi"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-65950-1_3|url=https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085|title=Data Science, Classification, and Related Methods|last=Hayashi|first=Chikio|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Springer Japan|isbn=9784431702085|editor-last=Hayashi|editor-first=Chikio|series=Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization|location=|pages=40–51|language=en|chapter=What is Data Science?

In November 1997, [[C.F. Jeff Wu]] gave the inaugural lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?"&lt;ref name="cfjwutk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=C. F. J. (1997)|title=Statistics = Data Science?|url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf|

Carver Professorship at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="cfjwu01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Identity of statistics in science examined|publisher=The University Records, 9 November 1997, The University of Michigan|url=http://ur.umich.edu/9899/Nov09_98/4.htm|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this lecture, he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making. In his conclusion,
he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of the term "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.&lt;ref name="cfjwutk"/&gt;
Later, he presented his lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?" as the first of his 1998 P.C. Mahalanobis Memorial Lectures.&lt;ref name="cfjwu02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isical.ac.in/~statmath/html/pcm/pcm_recent.html|title=P.C.

In 2001, William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate "advances in computing with data" in his article "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics," which was published in Volume 69, No. 1, of the April 2001 edition of the International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique.&lt;ref name="cleveland01"&gt;Cleveland, W. S. (2001). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/915c/d8e2b39eb02723553913d592b2237d4d9960.pdf Data science: an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics]. International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique, 21–26&lt;/ref&gt; In his report, Cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science: multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, computing with data, pedagogy, tool evaluation, and theory.

The journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research. In 2005, The National Science Board published "Long-lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century" defining data scientists as "the information and computer scientists, database and software and programmers, disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians, archivists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection" whose primary activity is to "conduct creative inquiry and analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Science Board|title=Long-Lived Digital Data Collections Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century|url=http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2005/nsb0540/|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 [[Harvard Business Review]] article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/|title=Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|first1=Thomas H.|last1=Davenport|authorlink1=Thomas H.

He asserts that a data scientist is "a new breed", and that a "shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors", but describes a much more business-oriented role.

In 2013, the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsaa.co|title=IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched.

==Relationship to statistics==
The popularity of the term "data science" has exploded in business environments and academia, as indicated by a jump in job openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/data-science-white-hot/|title=Data science is still white hot, but nothing lasts forever|last=Darrow|first=Barb|date=May 21, 2015|work=Fortune|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and [[statistics]]. Writing in [[Forbes]], Gil Press argues that data science is a [[buzzword]] without a clear definition and has simply replaced “[[business analytics]]” in contexts such as graduate degree programs.&lt;ref name="GilPress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Science: What's The Half-Life Of A Buzzword?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the question-and-answer section of his keynote address at the Joint Statistical Meetings of [[American Statistical Association]], noted applied statistician [[Nate Silver]] said, “I think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician....Statistics is a branch of science. Data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldn’t berate the term statistician.”&lt;ref name="NateSilver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians|url=http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-What-I-need-from-statisticians.html|date=23 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in business sector, multiple researchers and analysts state that data scientists alone are far from being sufficient in granting companies a real competitive advantage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Steven|date=2014-04-10|title=Collaborative Approaches Needed to Close the Big Data Skills Gap|url=http://www.jorgdesign.net/article/view/9823|journal=Journal of Organization Design|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=26–30|doi=10.7146/jod.9823|issn=2245-408X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consider data scientists as only one of the four greater job families companies require to leverage big data effectively, namely: data analysts, data scientists, big data [[Software Developer|developers]] and big data [[Software engineer|engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Mauro|first=Andrea|last2=Greco|first2=Marco|last3=Grimaldi|first3=Michele|last4=Ritala|first4=Paavo|title=Human resources for Big Data professions: A systematic classification of job roles and required skill sets|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306457317300018|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2017.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, responses to criticism are as numerous. In a 2014 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] article, Irving Wladawsky-Berger compares the data science enthusiasm with the dawn of [[computer science]]. He argues data science, like any other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field, employs [[Methodology|methodologies]] and practices from across the [[Academy|academia]] and [[industry]], but then it will morph them into a new [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]. He brings to attention the sharp criticisms computer science, now a well respected academic discipline, had to once face.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/05/02/why-do-we-need-data-science-when-weve-had-statistics-for-centuries/|title=Why Do We Need Data Science When We’ve Had Statistics for Centuries?|last=Wladawsky-Berger|first=Irving|date=May 2, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[New York University|NYU]] [[NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights|Stern's]] Vasant Dhar, as do many other academic proponents of data science,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; argues more specifically in December 2013 that data science is different from the existing practice of data analysis across all [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]], which focuses only on explaining [[data set]]s. Data science seeks actionable and consistent [[Pattern recognition|pattern]] for [[Predictive modelling|predictive uses]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This practical engineering goal takes data science beyond traditional [[analytics]]. Now the data in those disciplines and [[Applied science|applied fields]] that lacked solid [[Theory|theories]], like [[health science]] and [[social science]], could be sought and utilized to generate powerful predictive models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an effort similar to Dhar's, Stanford professor [[David Donoho]], in September 2015, takes the proposition further by rejecting three simplistic and misleading definitions of data science in lieu of criticisms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donoho|first=David|date=September 2015|title=50 Years of Data Science|url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf|journal=Based on a talk at Tukey Centennial workshop, Princeton NJ Sept 18 2015|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, for Donoho, data science does not equate to [[big data]], in that the size of the data set is not a criterion to distinguish data science and statistics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Second, data science is not defined by the [[computing]] skills of sorting big data sets, in that these skills are already generally used for analyses across all disciplines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Third, data science is a heavily applied field where [[Graduate school|academic programs]] right now do not sufficiently prepare data scientists for the jobs, in that many [[Graduate school|graduate programs]] misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Big Data|last=Barlow|first=Mike|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[statistician]], [[David Donoho|Donoho]], following many in his field, champions the broadening of learning scope in the form of data science,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; like John Chambers who urges statisticians to adopt an inclusive concept of learning from data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=John M.|date=1993-12-01|title=Greater or lesser statistics: a choice for future research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00141776|journal=Statistics and Computing|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=182–184|doi=10.1007/BF00141776|issn=0960-3174}}&lt;/ref&gt; or like William Cleveland who urges to prioritize extracting from data applicable [[Predictive modelling|predictive tools]] over [[Explanatory model|explanatory theories.]]&lt;ref name="cleveland01" /&gt; Together, these [[statistician]]s envision an increasingly inclusive applied field that grows out of traditional [[statistics]] and beyond.

For the future of data science, Donoho projects an ever-growing environment for [[open science]] where data sets used for [[Academic publishing|academic publications]] are accessible to all researchers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institute of Health]] has already announced plans to enhance reproducibility and transparency of research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|last2=Tabak|first2=Lawrence A.|date=2014-01-30|title=NIH plans to enhance reproducibility|journal=Nature|volume=505|issue=7485|pages=612–613|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4058759|pmid=24482835|doi=10.1038/505612a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other big [[Academic journal|journals]] are likewise following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNutt|first=Marcia|date=2014-01-17|title=Reproducibility|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/229|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6168|pages=229–229|doi=10.1126/science.1250475|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24436391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Roger D.|date=2009-07-01|title=Reproducible research and Biostatistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/10/3/405/293660|journal=Biostatistics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=405–408|doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014|issn=1465-4644}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the future of data science not only exceeds the boundary of [[Statistical theory|statistical theories]] in scale and methodology, but data science will revolutionize current academia and [[Paradigm|research paradigms]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Donoho concludes, "the scope and impact of data science will continue to expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, it can be stated '''''delegatus non potest delegare''''' ("one to whom power is [[delegate]]d cannot himself further delegate that power").&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is present in several [[jurisdictions]] such as that of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[India]] as well as in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]].

==Canada==
The principle was first articulated in [[Canada]] in 1943, in an article in the ''Canadian Bar Review'' by John Willis. While it is acknowledged as "the seminal articulation of the law governing the subdelegation of statutory and discretionary powers"&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; and it is still often cited,&lt;ref&gt;''Comeau's Sea Foods Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 12''&lt;/ref&gt; it has not achieved the rigid standing that was originally intended. The maxim has had some success as an operating principle in the restriction of delegation of legislative and judicial powers, but the demands of modern governmental regulatory practices have inhibited its application in the delegation of administrative powers.&lt;ref name="Mullan_368"/&gt; Exceptions are rare and dependent on the statute conferring power.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, D.J. (2001) Essentials of Canadian Law: Administrative Law. Toronto: Irwin Law. {{ISBN|1-55221-009-X}}. p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ramawad v. Canada (Minister of manpower and Immigration) 2 S.C.R. 375''&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In [[India]], the law was first stated in ''A K ROY v. State Of Punjab'', (1986) 4 SCC 326, that sub delegation of delegated power is ultra vires to the Enabling Act.&lt;ref&gt; (1986) 4 SCC 326 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|last=manupatra|title=In Re: The Delhi Laws Act, 1912, the Ajmer-Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947 and the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950|url=|publisher=Manupatra|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In [[United States]], one of the earliest mentions of the principle occurred when it was cited by counsel for one of the litigants before the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] in 1794, in ''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794). The summary of the case reports, "Mr. Wilson had given no power to Noarth to transact his business; but if he even had, it is a maxim, that delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;''M'Intire v. Cunningham'', 1 Yeates 363 (Pa. 1794).&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim was first cited by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''United States v. Sav. Bank'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881) in which the case summary reports that one of the litigants argued, "The duty imposed by statute on the commissioner cannot be delegated to a collector. Delegata potestas non potest delegari."&lt;ref name=SavBank&gt;''[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/104/104.US.728.html United States v. Sav. Bank]'', 104 U.S. 728 (1881); ''see also'', ''[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/276/276.US.394.242.html J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States]'', 276 U.S. 394, 405-406 (U.S. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In [[Australia]] the maxim has been largely superseded by [[Statute]] and [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;M Aronson and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2013) at 6.20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D C Pearce and S Argument, Delegated Legislation in Australia (Lexis Nexis, 2012) at 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Creyke &amp; J McMillan, Control of Government Action: Text, Cases and Commentary, (3rd ed, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;There is a long line of authorities applying the [[Carltona doctrine|Carltona principles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Carltona doctrine|Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works]] [1943] 2 All ER 560.&lt;/ref&gt; to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners  (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 11 and 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DPP v His Honor Judge Fricke [1993] 1 VR 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though courts have found that where a stature expressly requires a personal action, such delegation is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kutlu v Director of professional Services Review (2011)197 FCR 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs(1997) 147 ALR 673 at 682.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50  per Gibbs J. at 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dooney''&lt;ref&gt;Dooney v Henry (2000) 174 ALR 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Australia]]([[Ian Callinan|Callinan J]]),&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Groves, H. P. Lee, Australian Administrative Law: Fundamentals, Principles and Doctrines ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XP2WI_VrBWgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=No+permanent+head+of+a+department+in+the+Public+Service+is+expected+to+discharge+personally+all+the+duties+which+are+performed+in+his+name+and+for+which+he+is+accountable+to+the+responsible+Minister&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJyfpPkKfb&amp;sig=vN4vEYRQBh4YGyxjlrZ2kpdCgFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qMWWitnWAhWJE7wKHdcWCawQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=No%20permanent%20head%20of%20a%20department%20in%20the%20Public%20Service%20is%20expected%20to%20discharge%20personally%20all%20the%20duties%20which%20are%20performed%20in%20his%20name%20and%20for%20which%20he%20is%20accountable%20to%20the%20responsible%20Minister&amp;f=false  p262].&lt;/ref&gt; observed that&lt;I&gt; "No permanent head of a department in the Public Service is expected to discharge personally all the duties which are performed in his name and for which he is accountable to the responsible Minister&lt;/I&gt;."

This caselaw has been backed up by [[legislation]]. Section 34AA and 34AAB of the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]s &lt;i&gt;[[Acts Interpretation Act 1901]]&lt;/i&gt; clearly create a statutory power to delegate, contrary to the maxim. The federal legislation is echoed in some state legislation &lt;ref&gt;See for example &lt;I&gt;The Interpretation Act 1987&lt;/I&gt; of [[New South Wales]]  section 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts Interpretation Act 1915 ([[South Australia|SA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1918 ([[Western Australia|WA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic canon law==
{{canon law}}
Canon 137 of the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' states:

:§ 1 Ordinary executive power can be delegated either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the law expressly provides otherwise.

:§ 2 Executive power delegated by the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]] can be subdelegated, either for an individual case or for all cases, unless the delegation was deliberately given to the individual alone, or unless subdelegation was expressly prohibited.

:§ 3 Executive power delegated by another authority having ordinary power, if delegated for all cases, can be subdelegated only for individual cases; if delegated for a determinate act or acts, it cannot be subdelegated, except by the express grant of the person delegating.

:§ 4 No subdelegated power can again be subdelegated, unless this was expressly granted by the person delegating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">== Momentum in open channel flow ==

=== What is momentum?===
[[Momentum]] for one-dimensional flow in a channel can be given by the expression:&lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M=\frac{Q^2}{gA}+\overline yA&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
:{|
|where:	
* M is the momentum [L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]
* Q is the rate of flow [L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s]
* g is the acceleration due to gravity [L/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]
* A is the cross sectional area of flow [L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]
* ȳ is the distance from the centroid of A to the water surface [L]
|}

For [[open channel flow]] calculations where momentum can be assumed to be [[Momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Conservation of Momentum|conserved]], such as in a hydraulic jump, we can equate the Momentum at an upstream location,''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, to that at a downstream location, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M_1=\frac{Q^2}{gA_1}+\overline y_1A_1=\frac{Q^2}{gA_2}+\overline y_2A_2=M_2&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Momentum in a rectangular channel ===
In the unique circumstance where the flow is in a rectangular channel (such as a laboratory flume), we can describe this relationship as [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#The momentum equation for horizontal, rectangular channels|unit momentum]], by dividing both sides of the equation by the width of the channel.  This produces &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M in terms of ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is given by the equation: &lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_1}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2} =\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}={_uM_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:{|
|where:	
* &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M is M/b [L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]
* q is Q/b [L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T]
* b is the base width of the rectangular channel [L]
|}

=== Why is momentum important? ===
Momentum is one of the most important basic definitions in [[Fluid mechanics|Fluid Mechanics]]. The conservation of momentum is one of the three fundamental physical principles in both Fluid Mechanics and [Open-channel flow | open channel flow] (the other two are mass conservation and energy conservation). This principle leads to the momentum equation set in three dimensions (x, y and z). With different assumptions, these momentum equations can be simplified to several widely applied forms:

With Newton’s second law, [[Newtonian fluids]] assumption and Stokes hypothesis, the original fluid momentum equations are derived as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. These equations are classic in Fluid Mechanics, but the nonlinearity in these partial differential equations make them difficult to solve mathematically. As a result, analytical solutions for the Navier–Stokes equations still remain a tough research topic.

For high Reynolds number flow, the effects of viscosity are negligible. In these cases, with the inviscid assumption, [[Navier–Stokes equations]] can be derived as [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. Though they are still nonlinear partial differential equations, the elimination of viscous terms simplifies the problem.

In some applications, when viscosity, [[Conservative vector field|rotationality]] and [[incompressible flow|compressibility]] of the fluid can be neglected, the Navier–Stokes equations can be further simplified to the Laplace equation form, which is referred as [[potential flow]].

In [[computational fluid dynamics]], solving the partial differential momentum equations mentioned above with discretized algebraic equations is the most important procedure to study flow characteristics in different applications.

Momentum also allows us to describe the characteristics of flow when energy is not conserved. [[HEC-RAS]], a widely used computer model developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers for calculating water surface profiles, considers that when flow passes through critical depth, the basic assumption of gradually varied flow required for the Energy Equation is not applicable. Locations where flow may make such a transition include: significant changes in slope, channel geometry (e.g. bridge sections), grade control structures, and the confluence of water bodies. In these instances, HEC-RAS will use a form of the momentum equation to solve for the water surface elevation at an unknown location.

In addition, momentum flux is one of the parameters to estimate fluid impact on offshore structures. Analysis of momentum flux in coastal regions can provide advisable infrastructure layout planning to minimize the potential hazards from extreme events such as storm surge, hurricane and tsunami (e.g. (Park et al. 2013), (Yeh 2006), (Guard et al. 2005) and (Chanson et al. 2002)).

=== What are the characteristics of momentum? ===
For discussion, we will consider an ideal, frictionless, [[Momentum-depth relationship in a rectangular channel|rectangular channel]].  For each value of q, a [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular rhannel#The M-y Diagram|unique curve]] can be produced where ''M'' is shown as a function of depth.  As is the case for specific energy, the minimum value of &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M, &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponds to [[momentum–depth relationship in a rectangular channel#Critical flow|critical depth]].  For each value of &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M greater than &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;, there are two depths that can occur.  These are called conjugate depths, and represent supercritical and subcritical alternatives for flow of a given &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M.  Since [[Hydraulic Jumps in Rectangular Channels|hydraulic jumps]] conserve momentum, if the depth at the upstream or downstream end of a hydraulic jump is known, we can determine the unknown depth by drawing a vertical line through the known depth and reading its conjugate. The M-y diagram below shows three M-y curves with unit discharge 10, 15
and 20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. It can be observed that the M-y curves shift in positive M axis as the q value increases. From the M-y equation mentioned earlier, as y increases to infinity, the q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / gy&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; term would be negligible, and the M value will converge to 0.5y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (shown as the black dashed curve in M-y diagram). By taking the derivative dM / dy = 0, we can also obtain the equation of minimum M with different q values:&lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dy} = y_c - \frac{q^2}{gy_c^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

By eliminating the term of q in the equation above with the relationship between q and y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = ( q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / g )&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt; ), and put the resulting equation of y into the original M-y ccg3 c
equation, we can obtain the characteristic curve of critical M and y (shown as the red dashed curve in M-y diagram):
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y_c = \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{M_c} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Dimensionless M’-y’ diagram ==

=== Why do we need dimensionless momentum–depth relationship? ===
Conjugate depths can be determined from curves like the one above.  However, since this curve is unique for q = 20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, we would have to develop a new curve for each rectangular channel of a given base width (or discharge).  If we can establish a dimensionless relationship, we can apply the curve to any problem in which the cross-section is rectangular in shape.  To create a dimensionless momentum–depth relationship, we will divide both sides by a normalizing value that will allow us to use a dimensionless relationship between Momentum and Depth for all values of ''q''.

=== Derivation of the dimensionless momentum–depth relationship ===
Given that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_1}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2} =\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}={_uM_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and that:  
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{q^2}={gy_c^3}&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
according to the [[Buckingham pi theorem|Buckingham {{pi}} theorem]], with dimensional analysis, we can normalize the relationship between depth and Momentum by dividing both by the value of the critical depth squared and substituting for q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to yield:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{_uM}{y_c^2} = \frac{gy_c^3}{gyy_c^2} + \frac{y^2}{2y_c^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
|}
:{|
|where:	
* y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical depth.
|}&lt;br /&gt;
If we let M’ = &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M/y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and y’ = y/y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, this equation becomes: 
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M'= \frac{1}{y'} + \frac{y'^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;  
|}

=== The dimensionless momentum–depth diagram ===
By applying the conversion to dimensionless units described above, the dimensionless momentum–depth diagram is produced below.
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Dimensionless M-y.png|400px]]
|}

=== What is the relationship between the dimensionless momentum–depth diagram and the dimensionless energy–depth diagram? ===
By close inspection of the [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|dimensionless dnergy–depth]] diagram, an interesting conclusion can be drawn, which is that M’ is the same function of y’ as E’ is of 1/y’, and vice versa.  This is demonstrated in the following chart that compares favorably to the chart of the [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|Dimensionless Energy-Depth]] Diagram.  Note that the only difference between the chart above and the one below is the values of the y-axis are the reciprocal of one another and that the scale has been changed to be consistent with the scale found in the discussion of [[Dimensionless Specific Energy Diagrams for Open Channel Flow|Dimensionless Energy-Depth]]. &lt;br /&gt;
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:left; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Dimensionless M v y-inverse.png|400px]]
|}
Because Energy and Momentum have this reciprocal relationship (found also in the non-dimensionless forms of these relationships), we can use a Dimensionless Energy-Depth Diagram to create a dimensionless momentum–depth diagram, and vice versa.

== Solution of simple version of hydraulic jump with dimensionless diagram ==
To demonstrate the use of a dimensionless momentum–depth diagram in the solution of a simple [[hydraulic jumps in rectangular hcannels|hydraulic jump]] problem (hydraulic jump is also very common in other situations. Let’s consider a rectangular channel with a base width of 10&amp;nbsp;ft, and a flow rate of 100&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, with a tailwater induced downstream depth of 6&amp;nbsp;ft.  What is the depth of flow at the upstream end of the hydraulic jump?

'''Step 1''' – Calculate q: 
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{Q}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;q=\frac{100 ft^3/s}{10 ft}=10ft^2/s&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 2''' – Calculate y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y_c=\sqrt[3]{q^2 \over g}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_c=\sqrt[3]{{(10 ft^2/s)}^2 \over 32.2 ft/s^2}=1.459 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| (note-calculations are displayed to 3 decimal places to reduce rounding errors in '''Step 6''')
|}

'''Step 3''' – Calculate y’ for the downstream depth:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{y_d}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{6 ft}{1.46 ft}=4.112&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 4''' – Determine Conjugate Dimensionless Depth from Chart:

Using the Dimensionless Chart presented above, plot y’ = 4.11 over to its intersection with the M’ curve.  Read down the chart to find the conjugate depth and determine the new y’ from the left axis.
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| [[File:Solution plot.png|400px|Solution plot]]
|}
'''Step 5''' – Calculate the upstream (conjugate) depth to  6&amp;nbsp;ft by converting y’ = 0.115 to its actual depth:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{y_u}{y_c}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{y_u}={y'}{y_c}=0.115(1.459ft)=0.168 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}
'''Step 6''' – Validation:
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_u}=\frac{q^2}{gy_1}+ \frac{y_1^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_u}=\frac{10^2}{(32.2)0.168}+ \frac{0.168^2}{2}=18.500ft^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and
{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_d}=\frac{q^2}{gy_2}+ \frac{y_2^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;{_uM_d}=\frac{10^2}{(32.2)6}+ \frac{6^2}{2}=18.518ft^2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
The difference between &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is shown as 0.18&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; due to rounding errors.  Therefore, &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; are shown to represent the same unit momentum across the jump and momentum is conserved, validating the calculations using the Dimensionless Chart above.

This topic contribution was made in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Virginia Tech, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering course: CEE 5984 – Open Channel Flow during the Fall 2010 semester.

== Solution of hydraulic jump with sluice gate ==
The following example of a hydraulic jump at a [[Sluice|sluice gate]] outlet will give a clear idea about how conservation of energy and conservation of momentum apply in open channel flow.

As shown in the middle panel in schematic plot, in a rectangular channel, deep upstream flow (position 1) encounters a sluice gate in front of position 2. A sluice gate imposes adecrease in flow depth at position 2, and a hydraulic jump is formed between position 2 and far downstream where the flow depth increases again (position 3). The left panel in Figure 2 shows the M-y diagram of these 3 positions (momentum is also referred to as other definitions in different references, e.g. “Specific Force” in (Chaudhry 2008)), while the right panel in schematic plot shows the [[Energy–depth relationship in a rectangular channel|E-y]] diagram for these 3 positions. Energy loss can be neglected between position 1 and 2 (e.g. assuming conservation of energy), but the external thrust on the gate causes significant momentum loss. By contrast, between positions 2 and 3, turbulence in the hydraulic jump dissipates energy, while the momentum can be assumed to be conserved. If we know the unit discharge as q = 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s and the flow depth at position 1 as y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.0&amp;nbsp;ft, by applying energy conservation between position 1 &amp; 2 and momentum conservation between 2 &amp; 3, the flow depths at position 2 (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 3 (y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be computed.

Applying [[Energy–depth relationship in a rectangular channel|conservation of energy]] between position 1 &amp; 2:

| &lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_1 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_1} = y_2 + \frac{q^2}{2gy_2} = 8.02 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_2 = \frac{2y_1}{-1 + \sqrt{1+8\frac{gy_1^3}{q^2}}} =0.45 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Applying conservation of momentum between position 2 &amp; 3:

{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;M_2 = M_3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{y_2}{2} + \frac{q^2}{gy_2} = \frac{y_3}{2} + \frac{q^2}{gy_3} = 32.4 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;y_3 = \frac{y_2}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{1+8\frac{q^2}{gy_2^3}}) = 3.46 ft&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In addition, we can obtain the thrust on the sluice gate as well:

{| style="border:0px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"
| &lt;math&gt;\triangle{M} = M_1 - M_2 = 25.5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;Thrust = \gamma \triangle{M} = \rho g \triangle{M} = 1590 lbs/ff&lt;/math&gt;
|}

(The example above comes from Dr. Moglen’s “Open Channel Flow” course (CEE5384) in Virginia Tech, U.S.)

==Conceptual frame==
During differentiation, [[pluripotent]] cells make a number of developmental decisions to generate first the three [[germ layer]]s (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) of the embryo and intermediate progenitors,&lt;ref name="cshlp"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1129.long|title=Embryonic stem cell differentiation: emergence of a new era in biology and medicine|publisher=genesdev.cshlp.org|accessdate=2014-11-06|author=Keller G}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by subsequent decisions or check points, giving rise to all the body's mature tissues.&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt; The differentiation process can be modeled as sequence of binary decisions based on [[probabilistic]] or [[stochastic]] models. Developmental biology and embryology provides the basic knowledge of the cell types' differentiation through [[mutation]] analysis, lineage tracing, embryo micro-manipulation and [[gene expression]] studies. Cell differentiation and tissue [[organogenesis]] involve a  limited set of [[Signaling pathways|developmental signaling pathways]].&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt; It is thus possible to direct cell fate by controlling cell decisions through extracellular signaling, mimicking developmental signals.

==Source material==
''Directed differentiation'' is primarily applied to [[pluripotent stem cell]]s (PSCs) of mammalian origin, in particular mouse and human cells for [[biomedical research]] applications.&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt;  Since the discovery of [[Embryonic stem cells|embryonic stem]] (ES) cells (1981) and [[Induced pluripotent stem cells|induced pluripotent stem]] (iPS) cells (2006), source material is potentially unlimited.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigating human disease using stem cell models|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|vauthors=Sterneckert JL, Reinhardt P, Schöler HR|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=15|issue=9|pages=625–639|year=2014|doi=10.1038/nrg3764|pmid=25069490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, [[P19 cell|embryonic carcinoma]] (EC) cells have also been used.&lt;ref name="nih5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Retinoic acid induces embryonal carcinoma cells to differentiate into neurons and glial cells|publisher=The Rockefeller University Press|pmid=7107698|pmc=2112882|vauthors=Jones-Villeneuve EM, McBurney MW, Rogers KA, Kalnins VI|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=1982|volume=94|issue=2|pages=253–262|doi=10.1083/jcb.94.2.253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibroblasts or other differentiated cell types have been used for [[Examples of in vitro transdifferentiation by lineage-instructive approach|direct reprogramming]] strategies.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

==Methods==
Cell differentiation involves a transition from a proliferative mode toward differentiation mode. ''Directed differentiation'' consists in mimicking developmental (embryo's development) decisions in vitro using the stem cells as source material.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; For this purpose, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are cultured in controlled conditions involving specific substrate or [[extracellular matrices]] promoting cell adhesion and differentiation, and define [[Chemically defined medium|culture media]] compositions.&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt; A limited number of signaling factors such as [[growth factors]] or [[small molecules]], controlling cell differentiation, is applied sequentially or in a combinatorial manner, at varying [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] and exposure time.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; Proper differentiation of the cell type of interest is verified by analyzing  [[Biomarker|cell type specific markers]], [[gene expression]] profile, and functional assays.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

===Early methods===
* co-culture with [[stromal cells]] or [[feeder cell]]s, and on specific culture substrates:
support cells and matrices provide developmental-like environmental signals.&lt;ref name="nih6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Embryonic stem-cell culture as a tool for developmental cell biology|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=17522593|vauthors=Nishikawa S, Jakt LM, Era T|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=8|issue=6|pages=502–507|year=2007| doi=10.1038/nrm2189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3D cell aggregate formation, termed [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] (EBs): the aggregate aim at mimicking early embryonic development and instructing the cell differentiation.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt;
* culture in presence of [[fetal bovine serum]], removal of pluripotency factors.

===Current methodologies===

====Directed differentiation====
This method consists in exposing the cells to specific signaling pathways modulators and  manipulating cell culture conditions (environmental or exogenous) to mimick the natural sequence of developmental decisions to produce a given cell type/tissue.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt; A drawback of this approach is the necessity to have a good understanding of how the
cell type of interest is formed.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

====Direct reprogramming====
This method, also known as [[transdifferentiation]] or direct conversion, consists in overexpressing one or several factors, usually transcription factors, introduced in the cells.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; The starting material can be either pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), or either differentiated cell type such as fibroblasts. The principle was first demonstrated in 1987 with the myogenic factors MyoD.&lt;ref name="nih7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.
|vauthors=Davis RL, Weintraub H, Lassar AB|journal=Cell|volume=51|issue=6|pages=987–1000|year=1987|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=3690668|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90585-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A drawback of this approach is the introduction of foreign nucleic acid in the cells and the forced expression of transcription factors which effects are not fully understood.

====Lineage/cell type-specific selection====
This methods consists in selecting the cell type of interest, usually with [[antibiotic resistance]]. For this purpose, the source material cells are modified to contain antibiotic resistance cassette under a target cell type specific [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].&lt;ref name="nih8"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endothelial cells genetically selected from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells incorporate at sites of neovascularization in vivo|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=11973349|doi=|journal=Journal of Cell Science|year=2002|volume=115|issue=Pt 10|pages=2075–2085|vauthors=Marchetti S, Gimond C, Iljin K, Bourcier C, Alitalo K, Pouysségur J, Pagès G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih9"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetically selected cardiomyocytes from differentiating embronic stem cells form stable intracardiac grafts|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|vauthors=Klug MG, Soonpaa MH, Koh GY, Field LJ|pmid=8690796|pmc=507419|doi=10.1172/JCI118769|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|year=1996|volume=98|issue=1|pages=216–224.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only cells committed to the lineage of interest is surviving the [[Selection (biology)|selection]].

==Applications==
''Directed differentiation'' provides a potentially unlimited and manipulable source of cell and tissues.
Some applications are impaired by the [[Developmental biology|immature phenotype]] of the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)-derived cell type, which limits the physiological and functional studies possible.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt;
Several application domains emerged:

===Model system for basic science===
For [[basic science]], notably [[developmental biology]] and [[cell biology]], [[Stem cell|PSC]]-derived cells allow to study at the molecular and cellular levels fundamental questions in vitro,&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; that would have been otherwise extremely difficult or impossible to study for technical and ethical reasons in vivo such as embryonic development of human. In particular, differentiating cells are amenable for quantitative and qualitative studies.&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt;
More complex processes can also be studied in vitro and formation of organoids, including cerebroids, [[Optic cup (embryology)|optic cup]] and [[kidney]] have been described.

===[[Drug discovery]] and [[toxicology]]===
Cell types differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are being evaluated as [[preclinical]] in vitro models of Human diseases.&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; Human cell types in a dish provide an alternative to traditional preclinical assays using animal, human [[immortalized cells]] or primary cultures from [[biopsies]], which their limitations. Clinically-relevant cell types i.e. cell type affected in diseases are a major focus of research, this includes [[hepatocytes]], [[Islets of Langerhans|Langerhans islet]] [[beta-cells]],&lt;ref name="nih10"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to insulin-secreting structures similar to pancreatic islets|vauthors=Lumelsky N, Blondel O, Laeng P, Velasco I, Ravin R, McKay R|journal=Science|year=2001|
volume=292|issue=5520|pages=1389–1394|doi=10.1126/science.1058866|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=11326082}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cardiomyocytes]] and  [[neurons]]. [[Drug screen]] are performed on miniaturized cell culture in multiwell-plates or on a chip.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt;

===Disease modeling===
PSCs-derived cells from patients are used in vitro to recreate specific pathologies.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt; The specific cell type affected in the pathology is at the base of the model. For example, motoneurons are used to study [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA) and cardiomyocytes&lt;ref name="cell"/&gt; are used to study [[arrythmia]]. This can allow for a better understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] and the development of new treatments through drug discovery.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt; Immature PSC-derived cell types can be matured in vitro by various strategies, such as [[in vitro ageing]], to modelize age-related disease in vitro.
Major diseases being modelized with PSCs-derived cells are [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[Alzheimer's]] (AD), [[Parkinson's]] (PD), [[fragile X syndrome]] (FXS), [[Huntington disease]] (HD), [[Down syndrome]], Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), [[muscular dystrophies]],&lt;ref name="pmid26237517"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chal J, Oginuma M, Al Tanoury Z, Gobert B, Sumara O, Hick A, Bousson F, Zidouni Y, Mursch C, Moncuquet P, Tassy O, Vincent S, Miyanari A, Bera A, Garnier JM, Guevara G, Hestin M, Kennedy L, Hayashi S, Drayton B, Cherrier T, Gayraud-Morel B, Gussoni E, Relaix F, Tajbakhsh S, Pourquié O|title = Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to muscle fiber to model Duchenne muscular dystrophy |journal = [[Nat.

===Regenerative medicine===
The potentially unlimited source of cell and tissues may have direct application for [[tissue engineering]], cell replacement and [[organ transplantation|transplantation]] following acute injuries and [[reconstructive surgery]].&lt;ref name="cell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; These applications are limited to the cell types that can be differentiated efficiently and safely from human PSCs with the proper [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; Decellularized organs are also being used as tissue scaffold for organogenesis. Source material can be normal healthy cells from another donor (heterologous transplantation) or genetically corrected from the same patient (autologous).
Concerns on  patient safety have been raised due to the possibility of contaminating undifferentiated cells. The first clinical trial using hESC-derived cells was in 2011.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/first-test-of-human-embryonic-stem-cell-therapy-in-people-discontinued/2011/11/14/gIQAQBTOMN_story.html|title=First test of human embryonic stem cell therapy in people discontinued - The Washington Post|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first clinical trial using hiPSC-derived cells started in 2014 in Japan.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/12/national/science-health/japanese-ips-based-retina-transplant-a-global-first/#.VFmnIBZ5fYE|title=Japanese team first to use iPS cells in bid to restore human sight &amp;#124; The Japan Times|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

As an Earth-grazer [[Atmospheric entry|passes through the atmosphere]] its mass and velocity are changed, so that its [[orbit]], as it re-enters space, will be different from its orbit as it encountered [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="gsna"&gt;[http://www.fis.unipr.it/~albino/ITASN/GSNA/US19720810/US19720810.html US19720810 (Daylight Earth grazer)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307122520/http://www.fis.unipr.it/~albino/ITASN/GSNA/US19720810/US19720810.html |date=March 7, 2004 }} Global Superbolic Network Archive, 2000, 'Size: 5 to 10 m'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050120051405/http://www.maa.agleia.de/Comet/Other/1972.html Daylight Fireball of August 10, 1972] C. Kronberg, Munich Astro Archive, archived summary by Gary W. Kronk of early analysis and of Zdeněk Ceplecha's paper for Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1994, '3 meters, if a carbonaceous chondrite, or as large as 14 meters, if composed of cometary materials', 'post-encounter ... 2 or 10 meters'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spurny /&gt;

There is no agreed-upon end to the upper atmosphere, but rather incrementally thinner air from the [[stratosphere]] (~50&amp;nbsp;km), [[mesosphere]] (~85&amp;nbsp;km), and [[thermosphere]] (~690&amp;nbsp;km) up to the [[exosphere]] (~10,000) (see also [[thermopause]]). For example, a [[meteoroid]] can become a [[meteor]] at an altitude of 85–120&amp;nbsp;km above the Earth.

== Known Earth-grazing fireballs ==

'''Ecology''' is a broad biological science and can be divided into many sub-disciplines using various criteria. Many of these fields overlap, complement and inform each other, and few of these disciplines exist in isolation.  For example, the [[population ecology]] of an organism is a consequence of its [[behavioral ecology]] and intimately tied to its [[community ecology]]. Methods from [[molecular ecology]] might inform the study of the population, and all kinds of data are modeled and analyzed using [[quantitative ecology]] techniques.  

When discussing the study of a single species, a distinction is usually made between its ''biology'' and its ''ecology''.  For example, "[[polar bear]] biology" might include the study of the polar bear's [[physiology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[pathology]] and [[ontogeny]],  whereas "polar bear ecology" would include a study of its prey species, its population and [[metapopulation]] status, distribution, dependence on environmental conditions, etc.  In that sense, there can be as many subdisciplines of ecology as there are species to study. 

==Other criteria==
[[Ecology]] can also be classified on the basis of:

* the primary kinds of organism under study, e.g. [[animal ecology]], [[plant ecology]], [[insect ecology]];
* the [[biomes]] principally studied, e.g. [[forest ecology]], [[grassland ecology]], [[desert ecology]], [[benthic ecology]], [[marine ecology]], [[urban ecology]];
* the geographic or climatic area, e.g. [[arctic ecology]], [[tropical ecology]]
* the spatial scale under consideration, e.g. [[macroecology]], [[landscape ecology]];
* the philosophical approach, e.g. [[systems ecology]] which adopts a [[holistic]] approach;
* the methods used, e.g. [[molecular ecology]].

==List of subdisciplines==
Specialized branches of ecology include, among others:

* [[applied ecology]], the practice of employing ecological principles and understanding to solve real world problems (includes [[agroecology]] and [[conservation biology]]);
* [[biogeochemistry]], effect of biota on global chemistry, and the cycles of matter and energy that transport the Earth's chemical components in time and space.
* [[biogeography]], the study of the geographic distributions of species ;
* [[chemical ecology]], which deals with the ecological role of biological chemicals used in a wide range of areas including defense against predators and attraction of mates;
* [[community ecology]], which focus on understanding how different species interact with each other;
* [[conservation biology|conservation ecology]], which studies how to reduce the risk of species extinction;
* [[ecological succession]], which focuses on understanding directed vegetation change;
* [[ecophysiology]] which studies the interaction of physiological traits with the abiotic environment;  
* [[ecotoxicology]], which looks at the ecological role of toxic chemicals (often [[pollutant]]s, but also naturally occurring compounds);
* [[evolutionary ecology]] or [[ecoevolution]] which looks at evolutionary changes in the context of the populations and communities in which the organisms exist;
* [[fire ecology]], which looks at the role of fire in the environment of plants and animals and its effect on ecological communities;
* [[functional ecology]], the study of the roles, or functions, that certain species (or groups thereof) play in an ecosystem;
* [[global ecology]], which examines ecological phenomena at the largest possible scale, addressing [[macroecology|macroecological]] questions;
* [[landscape ecology]], which studies the interactions between discrete elements of a [[landscape]]; 
* [[macroecology]], the study of large scale phenomena;
* [[marine ecology]], and [[aquatic ecology]], where the dominant environmental milieu is water;
* [[microbial ecology]], the ecology of micro-organisms;
* [[microecology]], the study of small scale phenomena;
* [[paleoecology]], which seeks to understand the relationships between species in fossil assemblages;
* [[population ecology]], which tries to gain understanding and predicting spatio-temporal dynamics of a single species. Includes Metapopulation ecology and Demography;
* [[quantitative ecology]], the development of mathematical and statistical tools to interpret and analyze ecological data;
* [[restoration ecology]], which attempts to understand the ecological basis needed to restore impaired or damaged ecosystems;
* [[soil ecology]], the ecology of the pedosphere;
* [[theoretical ecology]], the development of ecological theory, usually with mathematical, statistical and/or computer modeling tools;
* [[urban ecology]], the study of ecosystems in urban areas.

Ecology also plays important roles in many inter-disciplinary fields:

* [[ecological design]] and [[ecological engineering]].
* [[ecological economics]].
* [[festive ecology]].
* [[human ecology]] and [[ecological anthropology]].
* [[Social ecology (academic field)|social ecology]], [[ecological health]] and [[environmental psychology]].

Ecology has also inspired (and lent its name to) other non-biological disciplines such as

* [[industrial ecology]].
* [[media ecology]].
* [[software ecology]] and [[information ecology]].

Finally, ecology is used to describe several philosophies or ideologies, such as 

* [[deep ecology]]
* [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">An '''enhancer trap''' is a method in [[molecular biology]] that allows hijacking of an enhancer from another gene, and so, identification of [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]]. The enhancer trap construct contains a [[transposable element]] and a [[reporter gene]]. The first is necessary for (random) insertion in the genome, the latter is necessary for identification of the spatial regulation by the enhancer. On top of this, the construct usually includes a [[genetic marker]], e.g., the [[White (mutation)|white gene]] producing red-colored eyes in ''[[Drosophila]]'', or ampicillin resistance in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.

The most common and basic enhancer traps are: P&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[lacZ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and P&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[GAL4/UAS system|GAL4]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from [[yeast]]. There exists a large number of fly stocks containing GAL4 insertions and an equally large number of fly stocks containing an UAS DNA sequence followed by a gene of interest, which permits the expression of a large number of genes with different GAL4 "drivers".  Rather than generating transgenic flies with the enhancer linked directly to the gene of interest (which takes about a year, if you are starting without the appropriate DNA construct), you simply mate (cross) one transgenic fly with another transgenic fly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Brand]] and [[Norbert Perrimon]] (1993).

'''Expressionist architecture''' is an architectural movement in Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in [[Germany]]. [[Brick Expressionism]] is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in [[The Netherlands]] ([[Amsterdam School]]). Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of [[Modern architecture]] ([[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], Expressionist- and [[Constructivist architecture]]).

==In the 1920s==

The term "Expressionist architecture" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stallybrass and Bullock, p.301–392 – entry by John Willett&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate.

Important events in expressionist architecture include; the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)]] in [[Cologne]], the completion and theatrical running of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]], Berlin in 1919, the [[Glass Chain]] letters, and the activities of the [[Amsterdam School]]. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]]. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably [[Hans Scharoun]], continued to work in an expressionist idiom.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"&gt;Pehnt, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"/&gt; Until the 1970s scholars&lt;ref&gt;Most notably [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later [[International style (architecture)|International style]], but this has been re-evaluated in recent years.

==Characteristics==

Expressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.166&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works.

#Distortion of form for an emotional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Taut, Die Stadtkrone 1919 p.87, quote ''"Architecture is art and ought to be the highest of the arts. It consists exclusively of powerful emotion and addresses itself exclusively to the emotions."''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Subordination of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.
#An underlying effort at achieving the new, original, and visionary.
#Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of [[concept]]s more important than pragmatic finished products.
#Often hybrid solutions, irreducible to a single concept.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"&gt;Pehnt, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
#Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.19, Taut's mention of ''"earth-crust architecture"'' and what Poelzig deemed, ''"Important to remodel the earth's surface sculpturally."''&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary [[art nouveau]].
#Uses creative potential of [[artisan]] [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].
#Tendency more towards the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] than the [[Classical architecture|classical]]. Expressionist architecture also tends more towards the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] and the [[rococo]] than the classical.
#Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as [[Eastern world|eastern]] as [[western world|western]]. It draws as much from [[Moorish]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], and [[Indian architecture|Indian]] art and architecture as from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] or [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
#Conception of architecture as a work of art.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"/&gt;

==Context==

[[File:Taut Glass Pavilion exterior 1914.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Glass Pavilion]] at the [[Cologne]] [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition]], 1914 ([[Bruno Taut]])]]

Political, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the [[Weimar republic]] created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar [[October Revolution|revolution]] as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"&gt;Pehnt, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic movements that preceded expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the [[arts and crafts movement]] and [[art nouveau]] or in Germany, [[jugendstil]]. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in art nouveau, which was also prevalent in [[romanticism]], continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist, [[Ernst Haeckel]] was known by Finsterlin&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms.

The [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] architectural movements, and the [[dada]] anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, ''Frülicht'' included constructivist projects, including [[Vladimir Tatlin]]s ''Monument to the Third International''.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"&gt;Sharp, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; and urbanism&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist [[Antonio Sant'Elia]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.119"&gt;Pehnt, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Merzbau'' by Dada artist [[Kurt Schwitters]], with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.

Influence of individualists such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] also provided the surrounding context for expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudí was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of art nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of art nouveau than that of say Bruno Taut. The circle of der Ring, did know about Gaudí, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly arts and crafts or art nouveau, buildings such as the [[Hill House, Helensburgh|Hill House]] and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the [[Vienna Secession]] exhibition in 1900.

==Underlying ideas==

Many writers contributed to the ideology of expressionist architecture. Sources of [[philosophy]] important to expressionist architects were works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"&gt;Pehnt, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; particularly ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"/&gt; Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's ''Alpine Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Franz Kafka]] in his ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', with its shape shifting matched the material instability of expressionist architecture&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists such as [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Ernst Haeckel]] contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet [[Paul Scheerbart]] worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture.

Emergent [[psychology]] from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] was important to expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and space&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"&gt;Pehnt, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that, "Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt; The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of [[aesthetics]] had been developing, particularly through the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Schopenhauer]] and notions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the "science of art", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the Zeitschift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst "the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic theories of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], such as ''[[Concerning the Spiritual in Art]]'', and ''Point and Line to Plane'' were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"&gt;Sharp, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

A recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it [[monolith]]ic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future.&lt;ref&gt;Benson p.100&lt;/ref&gt; They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.
:''"Coloured glass destroys hatred","Without a glass palace life is a burden","Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm"'' – Paul Scheerbart, inscriptions on the 1914 Werkbund Glass Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"/&gt;
Another example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the towers namesake, ''Einstein'', and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, ''Ein stein''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.

Brick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. [[Josef Franke]] produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin Housing Estate "Legien-Stadt". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt ''"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick"''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the international style.

Europe witnessed a boom in [[Theatre|theatrical]] production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; [[Film|Cinema]] witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt;

Many architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for [[German Expressionism|expressionist films]]. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the [[performing arts]] held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor.

Built examples of expressionist theatres include [[Henry van de Velde]]'s construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and [[Hans Poelzig]]'s grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Grosses Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a "people's theatre".&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, ''Weltbaumeister''.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt;

Expressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on [[legend]]s or [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"&gt;Pehnt, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Poelzig designed scenographic sets for [[Paul Wegener]]'s 1920 film ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem]]''. Space in ''Der Golem'' was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the ''Cabinet of Doctor Caligari'', which was painted on canvas backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in ''Der Golem'' was able to create a whole village that "spoke with a Jewish accent."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"/&gt;

Herman Finsterlin approached [[Fritz Lang]] with an idea for a film.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Fritz Lang's film [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]] demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled ''Die Galoschen des Glücks''(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. On the film, Taut noted, "an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Taut, ''Die Gläserne Kette'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt; It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked.

==Abstraction==

The tendency towards abstraction in art corresponded with abstraction in architecture. Publication of ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art'' in 1912 by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in [[Der Blaue Reiter]] phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"/&gt; The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's ''Point and Line to Plane'' in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.

==Brick Expressionism==
{{main|Brick Expressionism}}
[[File:Chilehaus - Hamburg.jpg|thumb|235px|[[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]], 1923 ([[Fritz Höger]]) ]]
The term '''Brick Expressionism''' ({{lang-de|Backsteinexpressionismus}}) describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s or [[clinker brick]]s as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Ruhr area]], but the [[Amsterdam School]] belongs to the same category.

Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial [[Scheepvaarthuis]] (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925.

The great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups "[[Die Brücke]]" in [[Dresden]] since 1905 ([[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff|Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]],...) and "[[Der Blaue Reiter]]" in [[Munich]] since 1912 ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc|Marc]], [[August Macke|Macke]], [[Gabriele Münter|Münter]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky|Jawlensky]],...).

==Legacy==

The legacy of expressionist architecture extended to later movements in the twentieth century. It had an influence on its immediate successor, modern architecture, as well as Art Deco. The [[New Objectivity|new objectivity]] (''Neue Sachlichkeit'') art movement arose in direct opposition to expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in [[deconstructivism]], the work of [[Santiago Calatrava]], and the organic movement of [[blobitecture]].

Another movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is [[Metaphoric architecture]] which includes elements of [[biomorphism]] and [[Zoomorphic architecture]].  The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.&lt;ref name=metaphor&gt;

Many of the founders and significant players in expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.

===Art Deco===
{{Main|Art Deco}}
First identified at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] in 1925, [[art deco]] shares some characteristics of expressionism and is likely to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement – particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus – and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with [[art nouveau]] and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. Later examples of Art Deco, particularly in [[New York City]] can be seen as a Transatlantic equivalent of European expressionism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Expressionism since the 1950s===
The influential architectural critic and historian, [[Sigfried Giedion]] in his book ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism [[brutalist architecture|brutalism]] had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of [[Le Corbusier]] took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his [[Notre Dame du Haut]]. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré [[Mathias Goeritz]], published the "Arquitectura Emocional" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that "architecture's principal function is emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Goeritz, "El manifiesto de arquitectura emocional", in Lily Kassner, Mathias Goeritz, UNAM, 2007, p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mexican architect [[Luis Barragán]] adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project [[Torres de Satélite]] (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was [[Eero Saarinen]]. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as [[Eero Saarinen]]'s 1962 [[TWA Flight Center|TWA Terminal]] at [[JFK International Airport]]. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's ''Formspiels'' as any other, save [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]]. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently{{when|date=January 2011}} still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of [[Enric Miralles]], most notability his [[Scottish Parliament building]], [[deconstructivist]] architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]], as well as [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] architect [[Douglas Cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001394|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|title=The Canada Council for the Arts|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203103759/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Bauhaus]] expressionist phase ends. Standard arguments for the reasons for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. Rampant inflation in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the [[Zeitgeist]]. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, [[Johannes Itten]], to be replaced with the, then constructivist, [[László Moholy-Nagy]].

According to the book's preface, Factory Physics is "a systematic description of the underlying behavior of [[Operations_management#Production_systems|manufacturing systems]].  Understanding it enables managers and engineers to work with the natural tendencies of manufacturing systems to:

# Identify opportunities for improving existing systems.
# Design effective new systems.
# Make the [[trade-off]]s needed to coordinate policies from disparate areas.

The book is used both in industry and in academia for reference and teaching on [[operations management]]. It describes a new approach to manufacturing management based on the laws of Factory Physics science. The fundamental Factory Physics framework states that the essential components of all value streams or production processes or service processes are demand and transformation which are described by structural elements of flows and stocks. There are very specific practical, [[mathematical]] relationships that enable one to describe and control the performance of flows and stocks. The book states that, in the presence of [[Statistical variability|variability]], there are only three buffers available to synchronize [[demand]] and transformation with lowest [[cost]] and highest [[service level]]:

*[[Capacity utilization|capacity]]
*[[inventory]]
*response time.

The book states that its approach enables practical, predictive understanding of flows and stocks and how to best use the three levers to optimally synchronize demand and transformation.

This work won the 1996 [[Institute of Industrial Engineers]] IIE/Joint Publishers Book of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iienet2.org/awards.aspx?id=10802&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Griffith's experiment''', reported in 1928 by [[Frederick Griffith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffith|first=Fred.|authorlink=Frederick Griffith|title=The Significance of Pneumococcal Types|journal=Journal of Hygiene |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=January 1928|volume=27|issue=2|pages=113–159|jstor=4626734 |pmid=20474956 |pmc=2167760 |doi=10.1017/S0022172400031879}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorenz|first1=M. G.|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W.|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|Microbiological Reviews]]|volume=58 |issue=3|pages=563–602 |date=1994-09-01 |pmid=7968924|pmc=372978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=A. W.|title=Pneumococcal transformation — a backward view: Fourth Griffith Memorial Lecture|journal=[[Microbiology (journal)|Journal of General Microbiology]]|url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/73/1/1.full.pdf|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–11|year=1972|doi=10.1099/00221287-73-1-1|pmid=4143929|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffith's findings were followed by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|research in the late 1930s and early 40s]] that isolated [[DNA]] as the material that communicated this genetic information.

[[Pneumonia]] was a serious cause of death in the wake of the [[1918 flu pandemic|post-WWI Spanish influenza pandemic]], and Griffith was studying the possibility of creating a vaccine.  Griffith used two [[Strain (biology)|strain]]s of pneumococcus (''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'') bacteria which infect [[mouse|mice]] – a type III-S (smooth) which was [[virulent]], and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. The III-S strain synthesized a [[polysaccharide]] capsule that protected itself from the host's [[immune system]], resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host's immune system. A German bacteriologist, [[Fred Neufeld]], had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the [[Quellung reaction]] to identify them in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwDn7ubDO2kC Lehrer, Steven. Explorers of the Body. 2nd edition 2006 p 44]&lt;/ref&gt; Until Griffith's experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.

In this experiment, [[bacterium|bacteria]] from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been "transformed" into the lethal III-S strain by a "transforming principle" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.

Today, we know that the "transforming principle" Griffith observed was the [[DNA]] of the III-s strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the smooth protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, McLeod and McCarty]] and by [[Hershey–Chase experiment|Hershey and Chase]].

Infrared excesses are often the result of [[circumstellar dust]] and are common in [[young stellar object]]s and evolved stars on the [[asymptotic giant branch]] or [[Post-AGB|older]].

In addition, monitoring for infrared excess emission from stellar systems is one possible method that could enable a search for large-scale stellar engineering projects of a hypothetical extraterrestrial civilization; for example a [[Dyson sphere]] or [[Dyson swarm]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.space.com/24269-how-to-search-for-alien-civilizations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Professional Sound''', previously the '''Institute of Broadcast Sound''', is an organisation for audio professionals. The organisation provides opportunities for training and conferencing to assist in maintaining high standards in all areas of [[professional audio]] operations. The organisation is based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The organisation was founded in 1977 by sound balancers in [[BBC Television|BBC Television and Radio]] and [[ITV Network|Independent TV]], when its membership comprised audio practitioners working in all areas of broadcast audio including radio, location, and [[post-production]] sound. On 1 January 2012 the Institute of Professional Sound was adopted as the new name of the organisation, in order to attract a wider membership which is not exclusively from broadcasting.&lt;ref name=prosound&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundnewseurope.com/broadcastnews-content/full/ibs-changes-name-to-institute-of-professional-sound;jsessionid=022C388740727A42398954D209C87F06 |title=IBS changes name to Institute of Professional Sound - PSNE Magazine Online &amp; In Print |publisher=Prosoundnewseurope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute of Professional Sound was established in 1977 as the Institute of Broadcast Sound, by individuals working in radio and television, who recognised a need for a coordinated means for the exchange of innovative ideas between practitioners in the field of broadcast audio.&lt;ref name=prosound/&gt; The organisation serves as a catalyst to promote collaborative initiatives between manufacturers of digital audio recording and editing equipment. Listed among the successes of the organisation is the File Exchange Initiative, from which the [[iXML]] specification was established, setting an [[open standard]] for the inclusion of location sound metadata in [[Broadcast Wave Format|Broadcast Wave]] audio files.

== Projects ==

=== Mentoring ===
The Institute of Professional Sound offers mentoring and career enhancement opportunities for entry-level employees, college graduates, and seasoned professionals. The mentoring program is designed to coordinate members who desire to assist their colleagues progress and succeed in their career with individuals seeking the advice and support of more experienced practitioners in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/mentoring |title=IPS Mentoring |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training ===
The organisation provides training forums and conferences for its members which introduce members to emerging technologies, along with seminars on microphone placement and other operational issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/training |title=Training |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date=2006-04-08 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ofcom radio frequency spectrum ===
The Institute contributes to the ongoing discussions with [[Ofcom]], regarding the changes to the management and use of the radio frequency spectrum, where it represents several hundred members who are independent users of radio microphone and associated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/ofcom |title=Ofcom RF spectrum |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Email conferencing ===
Started in June 1995 with just 10 participants, the IPS's Internet email conference IBSNET  has  over 500 participants (as of 2012). Members include individuals from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Germany, Austria, United States, [[Malaysia]], Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The conference provides opportunities for comment and feedback regarding professional standards, working conditions, visa requirements, and radio microphone frequencies in other countries, in addition to putting location recordists in contact with one another and with the dubbing mixers, who may ultimately use their work.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6206">'''Julian Sleigh''', (6 October 1927 in [[Florence]] - 2 October 2013 in [[Cape Town]]) was a [[Christian Community]] priest, councillor, founding member of [[Camphill]] in [[South Africa]] and author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florisbooks.co.uk/authors/julian-sleigh.php Author Page, Floris Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Julian Sleigh was born in [[Florence, Italy]] on October 6, 1927 where his father lectured at the [[British Institute]], and was  baptised in the [[Florence Baptistery]] in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent his early childhood and schooling there before the family moved to London just before the war. On completing school he studied at the [[London School of Economics]]. This was followed by two years of national service in which he was selected for officer training.

Having since his early years longed for a community of people within which to work, he sought out, then joined Camphill, Scotland before helping to found the Camphill School in [[Hermanus]], South Africa in 1958. Peter Roth, a priest, flew to South Africa to conduct the service and inspired Sleigh in his endeavour to become a priest himself.&lt;ref name="Walk"&gt;Julian Sleigh "A Walk Through My Life" The Visual Junction, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Christian Community==

In 1963 Sleigh left Camphill to study for the priesthood in Germany and Britain, closely mentored and later accompanied in setting up the work in South Africa by Dr Alfred Heidenreich and Evelyn Francis Derry. After he was ordained in 1965, he returned to South Africa and together with Heinz Maurer, became the founding priest of the Christian Community in Southern Africa. Shortly after this, he and his family moved from Hermanus to set up the first Camphill village, Alpha, that is today the Camphill Village West Coast to the north of Cape Town. Here many of the children with [[Special Needs]] that had gone through the Camphill schools could find a home and place to work. At the same time, Sleigh was a priest in the Camphill communities, arranging for a chapel to be built at Alpha.

==Public engagement, counseling and outreach==

Through his long association with Professor Vera Grover from the early days in Hermanus, Sleigh joined forces with her in founding the Western Cape Forum for Mental Handicap (today the Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability) in an attempt to uplift the quality of life and the awareness of people with special needs more effectively throughout the country. He was the founding chairman from 1971-1985 and the first Honorary Life Member of the Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcfid.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WCFID_AR2014-Sept-RunPages.pdf Death Notice Julian Sleigh - Annual Report 2013-2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074531/http://wcfid.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WCFID_AR2014-Sept-RunPages.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcfid.co.za/download/Annual-Report-WCFID-40Years.pdf Forty Years - 1971-2011 Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074429/http://wcfid.co.za/download/Annual-Report-WCFID-40Years.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he was on the Executive of the National Council's (SANC) division for Mental Health and succeeded Prof. Grover as chairperson (1980-1984).

Soon after its inception in 1968, through his friendship with Rosemary van Niekerk, Western Cape Secretary of Lifeline South Africa, the telephone counseling service, Sleigh took the training as counsellor with Rev. Peter Storey. [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]] had been founded in Australia in 1963 by [[Alan Walker (theologian)|Sir Alan Walker]], using the counseling psychology and techniques developed by [[Carl Rogers]] and there are now centres in many different countries. Sleigh worked there as a volunteer for many years and helped set up the training together with Alan Hardie after the transfer of Peter Storey to Johannesburg as a Methodist bishop and inspired his book ''Crisis Points''.&lt;ref name="Walk" /&gt;

From 1968 onwards, beginning with the resettlement of former residents from [[District Six]], the [[coloured]] [[Township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] began to develop close to the Camphill village. Sleigh realised that facilities for the inevitable Special Needs requirements that are present in every community would have to be developed there. So he started the project that was, in time, to be taken over by Veronica Jackson and later by Mellville Segal, who wrote the book ''Turn Right At Magnolia Street'' to commemorate these experiences. Both had been long time co-workers of Camphill. They named the project Orion and it continues to function independently today under the name Orion Friendship Organisation.&lt;ref name="Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orion in South Africa II Melville Segal in Camphill Correspndence May/June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orion - Executive Annual Report: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionfriendship.org/home.php Homepage Orion Friendship Organisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073619/http://www.orionfriendship.org/home.php |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florisbooks.co.uk/authors/julian-sleigh-eulogy.php Eulogy by the Rev.

A '''Lactofuchsin mount''' (also spelled '''Lacto-fuchsin''' or '''Lacto-Fuchsin''') is a technique used for [[microscope slide|mounting]] [[fungi]] with [[hyphae]] on a [[microscope slide]] for examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=James L. |last1=Harris|title=Safe, Low-Distortion Tape Touch Method for Fungal Slide Mounts|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4683–4684|date=December 2000|pmid=11203439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of a lactofuchsin mount is that if performed correctly, it preserves the structure and arrangement of the hyphae, if present.
[[File:Lactofuchsin Mount.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of a fungus (unidentified) mounted using a Lactofuchsin mount.]]

==Advantages==

To examine the hyphae of fungi under a microscope, a [[Microscope_slide#Mounting|wet mount]] is essential. While this is possible to do with a water based mount, a better result can be obtained with lactofuchsin mounting fluid, which both sticks to the [[cell wall]]s and colours the cell walls red in the process. Lactofuchsin, a 1% solution of [[basic fuchsine]] in [[lactic acid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthlinkinc.net/MSDS/LactoFuchsin.pdf|title=Lactofuchsin MSDS|author=HealthLink}}&lt;/ref&gt; dries much slower than water, so the slide may be preserved for a longer period, particularly if the edges of the finished slide are sealed, for example with clear nail polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moulds under the microscope|url=http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/mycologywebpages/Moulds/Examination.html|work=Moulds: their isolation, cultivation, and identification|publisher=New Brunswick Museum|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[refractive index]] of the fluid is significantly different to that of the cell walls, which provides a stronger visual contrast of the cell walls against the background.

==Disadvantages==

A significant disadvantage of Lactofuchsin is its cost; prices are over $100USD for a small 20mL bottle. Only a few drops are used for each mount. Lactofuchsin is [[poison]]ous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136228">This is a list of [[molecule]]s that have been detected in the [[interstellar medium]] and [[circumstellar envelope]]s, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. The [[chemical formula]] is listed for each detected compound, along with any ionized form that has also been observed.

==Detection==
The molecules listed below were detected by [[spectroscopy]]. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component [[electron]]s between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in [[radio]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] portions of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=shu82/&gt;

Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often as the result of an interaction with a [[cosmic ray]]. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name=pnas103d/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name=brown_pais95/&gt;

===History===
The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the [[Universe]] was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |arxiv=1312.0613|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first carbon-containing molecule detected in the interstellar medium was the [[methylidyne radical]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1937.&lt;ref name=woon05/&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of more complex organic molecules (COMs),&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fred Hoyle]] and Chandra Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175&amp;nbsp;Å,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200Å interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space.

In 2004, scientists reported&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S.|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; detecting the [[spectral signature]]s of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] in the [[ultraviolet light]] emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|date=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537–549|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt; that since they discovered [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2010, [[fullerenes]] (or "[[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]") were detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39|title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae|last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

In October 2011, scientists found using [[spectroscopy]] that [[cosmic dust]] contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow|first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars|url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwok|first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/nature10542 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479...80K|pmid=22031328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of [[coal]] and [[petroleum]]; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;  These observations suggest that organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles could serve as basic ingredients for life due to their [[catalysis|surface-catalytic]] activities.&lt;ref name=Lincei&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gallori |first=Enzo |title=Astrochemistry and the origin of genetic material |journal=Rendiconti Lincei |date=November 2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=113–118 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x332837483630g24/ |accessdate=2011-08-11 |doi=10.1007/s12210-011-0118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Zita |title=Organic Chemistry of Carbonaceous Meteorites |journal=Elements |date =February 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=35–40|id=|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/1/35 |accessdate=2011-08-11|doi=10.2113/gselements.7.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"/&gt;

In August 2012, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/|accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that PAHs, subjected to [[interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[oxygenate|oxygenation]], and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[organic compound|organics]] — "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gudipati|first1=Murthy S.|last2=Yang|first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24|date=September 1, 2012|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]|volume=756|number=1|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012|bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G|pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/351444/description/Interstellar_chemistry_makes_use_of_quantum_shortcut#comment_351468 Interstellar chemistry makes use of quantum shortcut | Science News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at a significantly higher than expected rate, between cold (around 63 [[kelvin]]s) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which would have to be overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.

A particularly large and rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is [[Sagittarius B2]] (Sgr B2). This giant [[molecular cloud]] lies near the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature.&lt;ref name=ajss60/&gt; A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star [[CW Leonis]] (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.&lt;ref name=kaler2002/&gt;

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] [[organic compound]]s of [[life]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starting chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], found in [[meteorite]]s. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the [[Universe]], may have been formed in [[red giant]]s or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory |date=3 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of [[life]]&amp;mdash;the [[Carbon-hydrogen bond|carbon-hydrogen molecule]] (CH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;, or [[methylidyne radical]]), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation) and the carbon ion (C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation)&amp;mdash;are the result, in large part, of [[ultraviolet light]] from [[star]]s, rather than in other ways, such as the result of turbulent events related to [[supernovae]] and [[young star]]s, as thought earlier.&lt;ref name="NASA-20161012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=Building Blocks of Life's Building Blocks Come From Starlight |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6645 |date=12 October 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/15|bibcode=2016ApJ...829...15M|title=Herschel/HIFI Spectral Mapping of C+, CH+, and CH in Orion BN/Kl: The Prevailing Role of Ultraviolet Irradiation in CH+ Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=829|pages=15|year=2016|last1=Morris|first1=Patrick W.|last2=Gupta|first2=Harshal|last3=Nagy|first3=Zsofia|last4=Pearson|first4=John C.|last5=Ossenkopf-Okada|first5=Volker|last6=Falgarone|first6=Edith|last7=Lis|first7=Dariusz C.|last8=Gerin|first8=Maryvonne|last9=Melnick|first9=Gary|last10=Neufeld|first10=David A.|last11=Bergin|first11=Edwin A.|arxiv = 1604.05805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical models==
To explain the observed ratios of isomeric compounds, the minimum energy principle has been used. In the majority of cases, it explains that some organic entities have greater abundance than their isomers due to the lower total energies of the first one. However, a few exceptions where the principle fails are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattelais|first1=M.|last2=Pauzat|first2=F.|last3=Ellinger|first3=Y.|last4=Ceccarelli|first4=C.|title=Interstellar Complex Organic Molecules and the Minimum Energy Principle|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2009|volume=696|issue=2|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/L133|bibcode=2009ApJ...696L.133L|pages=L133–L136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach ignores energy and deals only with the molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into the range of the values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabirov|first1=Denis|title=Information entropy of interstellar and circumstellar carbon-containing molecules: Molecular size against structural complexity|journal=Computational and Theoretical Chemistry|date=1 December 2016|volume=1097|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1016/j.comptc.2016.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecules==
The following tables list molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium, grouped by the number of component [[atom]]s. If there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. For molecules where no designation was given in the scientific literature, that field is left empty. Mass is given in [[atomic mass unit]]s. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is listed in parentheses in each section header.

Most of the molecules detected so far are [[organic molecule|organic]]. Only one inorganic species has been observed in molecules which contain at least five atoms, SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt; Larger molecules have so far all had at least one carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.&lt;ref name="Klemperer2011"/&gt;

'''''Malaysia and the Club of Doom''''' (The Collapse of The Islamic Countries) is a book published in 2006 by [[Syed Akbar Ali]] who argues that countries with a [[Muslim]] majority population have collapsed economically, politically and socially.

==Theses==
With a particular focus on [[Malaysia]], the thesis of the book is that growing [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the political and social climate in Islamic countries are causing democracy and freedom to be threatened by religious irrationalism. He attempts to show how the curtailing of [[democracy]] and [[freedom of speech]] have caused those countries to collapse.  He further draws a distinction between Islam and its current practises, and offers his perspective that current practises of Muslims are not in vein with the true meaning of [[Islam]] with that being the underlying cause for the collapse of those countries.

The book takes pains to stress that many practises that define Islam on the world stage like stringent laws, cruel punishments and irrational beliefs cannot be found in the [[Quran]]. Syed Akbar Ali then proceeds to show that many of these extra Quranic beliefs and practises which have brought about the downfall of the Muslims are actually taken from the [[Bible]].

In the Malaysian context, his book also exposes a masquerade whereby certain 'Islamic' laws pertaining to divorce are actually a reworded version of [[English common law|English Law]] taken from the Marriage and Divorce Act -  a left over of British colonialism. The book also dismisses '[[Islamic banking]]' as 'Arabic banking' i.e. conventional banking with Arabic prefixes attached for camouflage.

==Author==
Syed Akbar Ali (49 years' old) is well known among the Malaysian [[intelligentsia]], especially among its Muslim intellectuals.  A graduate of an American university who developed a career in banking, Syed was also an often controversial newspaper columnist - pushing the envelope on free and unfettered discussion on religious and political issues in Malaysia.

His debut book ''To Digress A Little'', published in July 2005, stirred much discussion in Malaysia for its frank and honest appraisal of Malaysia's [[affirmative action]] policies which it claims have now outlived their usefulness.

The '''Napp Research Centre''' is a large medical research institute in the north of [[Cambridge]], and innovative-looking and award-winning architecture; it is a Cambridge [[landmark]].

==History==
Cambridge Science Park was built in the early 1970s and is part of the Napp Pharmaceutical Group, a pharmaceutical firm that manufactures analgesic, oncology and respiratory products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://napp.co.uk/products/patients Napp: Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandiose innovative-looking building was designed in 1979, and was built in 1981. Staff moved in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 1983. Three more buildings were added in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aukettswanke.com/projects/NAPP 2007 building]&lt;/ref&gt; Stage D, E and F1 were added in 2012, designed by CPN Architects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpna-uk.com/projects/ 2012 buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the building on 6 February 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 7 February 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] visited the building on 19 October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 21 October 1985, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988, the site was visited by the [[List of Presidents of Turkey|seventh President of Turkey]], [[Kenan Evren]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 15 July 1988, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of kings of Jordan|King of Jordan]], [[Abdullah II of Jordan]], visited the site with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] on 7 November 2001&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 8 November 2001, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; ; the visit also included [[Zeus Technology]].

The site works with [[Cambridge Academy for Science and Technology]], a [[University technical college|UTC]].

==Structure==
[[File:Cambridge Science Park Napp.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance in April 2011]]
The site is directly next to the [[A10 road (England)|A10]]/[[A14 road (England)|A14]] interchange, in [[South Cambridgeshire]].

==Awards==
In June 1984 it won [[The Concrete Society]]'s Award.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 14 June 1984, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomb of the Unknown Warrior June 2012.JPG|300px|thumb|The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in June 2012]]
The '''New Zealand Tomb of the Unknown Warrior''' is at the [[National War Memorial (New Zealand)|National War Memorial]] in Buckle Street, [[Wellington]]. 

On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unknown New Zealand soldier were exhumed from the ([[CWGC]]) [[Caterpillar Valley Cemetery]], and laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Wellington, New Zealand. He represents over 18,000 members of New Zealand forces who lost their lives during the First World War. A special headstone marks his original resting place in Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Handover16.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Catafalque]] Guard stands in position flanking the casket of the New Zealand Unknown Warrior during the handover ceremony|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 November 2007}}]] --&gt;On 6 November 2004 the remains, in a copper [[coffin]] sealed and placed in a [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] coffin brought from New Zealand, were handed over from the care of the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] to a New Zealand delegation during a ceremony at [[Longueval]], [[Somme (department)|Somme]], [[France]]. [[New Zealand Defence Force]] chief, [[Air Marshal]] [[Bruce Ferguson]], who had the task of repatriating the Warrior's remains, said of the occasion "I told him [the Warrior] we're taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian for ever".

The Warrior arrived in New Zealand on 10 November 2004. While he lay in state in the Parliament Buildings an estimated 10,000 people paid their respects. The Warrior was laid to rest on the 86th [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 2004, after a service at [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral]] and a 2.85 km [[Parade (military)|slow march]] procession through the streets of Wellington, lined by about 100,000 people. The Tomb was sealed with a [[bronze]] [[mantel]] at 3:59pm, bearing the words:&lt;br&gt;
{{cquote|An Unknown New Zealand Warrior&lt;br&gt;
He Toa Matangaro No Aotearoa}}

The Warrior is one of more than 1500 New Zealanders killed on the Somme. Most of them, 1272, remained unidentified and are buried in unmarked graves or remembered on memorial walls. The remains are thought to include an almost complete skeleton, and other belongings that established beyond doubt the Warrior's nationality.

==Awards==
The Warrior was awarded:
* [[1914–15 Star]] for service between August 1914 and December 1915
* [[British War Medal]] for service during World War I up to 1920
* [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]]
* [[1939–1945 Star]] for service during [[World War II]]
* [[New Zealand Operational Service Medal]]

The [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]] also awarded its Badge in Gold, the first time it has been awarded posthumously. Immediate Past National President David Cox, a World War II veteran, made the presentation:

{{cquote|The Badge in Gold is a fitting tribute because the Unknown Warrior paid the ultimate price for his service and now he is finally returned. You are now one of us — welcome home.}}

Each RNZRSA District President placed soil and other items into the Tomb to acknowledge the service personnel from their districts who had given their lives to the nation, including soil from the farm of [[Charles Upham]]. Soil from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery was provided by the [[Ambassador]] from France, Jean-Michel Marlaud.

'''Participatory planning''' is an [[urban planning]] [[paradigm]] that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of [[community development]].&lt;ref name="REFALPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/bsf/cppe/cppe.pdf|title= Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation|publisher=IFAD|accessdate=2008-10-21| format=PDF| date=December 2000| last=Lefevre | first=Pierre|last2=Kolsteren|first2=Patrick| last3=De Wael| first3=Marie-Paule | last4=Byekwaso| first4=Francis | last5= Beghin|first5=Ivan|location=Antwerp, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, [[marginalized]] groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"&gt;[McTague, C. &amp; Jakubowski, S. Marching to the beat of a silent drum: Wasted consensus-building and failed neighborhood participatory planning. Applied Geography 44, 182–191 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

===Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation===
Responding to the gap between the desires of local communities, and government programs such as [[urban renewal]], Sherry Arnstein wrote ''A Ladder of Citizen Participation'' to "encourage a more enlightened dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnstein|first1=Sherry R.|title=A Ladder Of Citizen Participation|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|date=July 1969|volume=35|issue=4|page=216|doi=10.1080/01944366908977225}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed the ladder as a typology, with eight rungs ranging from various degrees of nonparticipation, to degrees of tokenism, and ultimately, citizen power. Her critical assault on planning methods of the time has informed policies affecting the growth and change in participatory methods, broadening access to planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=Greg P.|title=Geographic specificity and positionality of public input in transportation: a rural transportation planning case from Central Texas|journal=Urban, Planning and Transport Research|date=16 October 2014|volume=2|issue=1|pages=407–422|doi=10.1080/21650020.2014.969442|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21650020.2014.969442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1971 [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] publication summarized seminars where professional planners, public administrators, and citizens debated the idea of participatory planning.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;[Metropolitan transportation planning seminars. (Washington :, 1971). at http://hdl.handle.net/2027/ien.35556021061726]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Transportation recognized that citizens felt excluded from the current planning processes.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; In the seminar the following questions were asked: "Why do you want citizens to participate? What kind of citizens should be included? When should citizen participation enter the planning process? How do you organize citizen participation? How much power should be invested in citizen participation groups? Where do local elected officials fit in the citizen participation element? What are the responsibilities of the planner regarding citizen participation?".&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; The consensus was that citizen participation is valuable for better planning as well as for minimizing confrontation; however, not everyone agreed on how to effectively involve citizens.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===Structure===
Planning needed a structure to allow natural and meaningful input from citizens.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"&gt;[Smith, R. W. A theoretical basis for participatory planning. Policy Sci 4, 275–295 (1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this to happen, planning needed to move away from its [[Hierarchy#Methods using the hierarchical model|hierarchical model]] and move toward a reticular model.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; The reticular model would allow for more citizen participation.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; While there is some demand for a [[wikt:top-down|top-down approach]] with [[centralized]] decision-making from experts, participatory planning uses a bottom-up approach. Participatory planning aims to add more participation in decision-making, increase the legitimacy of politicians and officials, and provide for more criticism of experts' plans.&lt;ref&gt;[Murray, M. Participatory Spatial Planning : Learning from Rural Ireland. (Ashgate Publishing Group, 2010). at &lt;http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10421617&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard approach to planning can be defined in the following quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Town and country planning might be described as the art and science of ordering the use of land and the character of siting of buildings and communication routes so as to secure the maximum practicable degree of economy, convenience and beauty (Keeble,1952)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This approach does not withstand the addition of complex regional and local [[socio-economic]] aspects. The top down model lacked a way to approach planning. Taylor proposes an entirely different approach to Keeble:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It suggested the need for a new kind of planner altogether, one who was trained in analyzing and understanding how cities and regions functioned spatially in economic and social terms – a planner, that is trained in [[economic geography]] or the [[social science]]s rather than [[architecture]] or [[surveying]] (Taylor 1998)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Participatory planning demands that planners incorporate a variety of interest groups in their process.&lt;ref&gt;[Davidoff, P. Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning. Journal of the American Institute of Planners 31, 331–338 (1965).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In the [[UN Habitat]] document ''Building Bridges Through Participatory Planning'', Fred Fisher, president of the International Development Institute for Organization and Management, identifies '''Participatory Reflection And Action''' (PRA) as the leading school of participatory planning.  He identifies [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Kurt Lewin]] as key pioneers, as well as claiming planning fathers [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Lewis Mumford]] as participatory planners.  Freire's belief that poor and exploited people can, and should be, enabled to analyze their own reality was a fundamental inspiration for the participatory planning movement. Lewin's relevance lay in his integration of democratic leadership, [[group dynamics]], [[Experiential education|experiential learning]], [[action research]], and [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s theory, and his efforts to overcome racial and ethnic injustices.

In general, PRA has been supplanted by '''[[Participatory rural appraisal|Participatory Learning and Action]]''' (PLA), which emphasizes the links between the participatory process and action. Related work has been done on ''[[community-based participatory research]]'' (CBPR).&lt;ref name="REFBETA"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=533&amp;cid=4474&amp;activeid=4471|title=Building Bridges through Participatory Planning|last=Fisher|first=Fred|year=2001|publisher=UN-HABITAT|accessdate=2008-10-21|isbn=92-1-131623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
[[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]], whom Fisher considered a leading icon of the movement, defines PRA according to the following principles;
;Handing over the stick (or pen or chalk)
:Facilitating investigation, analysis, presentation and learning by local people themselves, so they generate and own the outcomes and also learn.
;Self-critical awareness
:Facilitators continuously and critically examine their own behavior.
;Personal responsibility
:Taking responsibility for what is done, rather than, for instance, relying on the authority of manuals or on rigid rules.
;Sharing
:Involves the wide range of techniques now available, from chatting across the fence to photocopies and e-mail.

PRA and PLA methods and approaches include:
* Do-it-yourself: local people as experts and teachers, and outsiders as novices
* [[Local analysis]] of [[secondary source]]s
* Mapping and modeling
* Time lines and trend and change analysis
* Seasonal calendars
* Daily [[Time-use research|time-use analysis]]
* Institutional diagramming
* Matrix scoring and ranking
* Shared presentations and analysis, and
* Participatory planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring.

==Tools==

===E-Planning===
Participatory e-planning is relatively new way to engage citizens in urban planning. [[E-participation]] is defined as "technology-mediated interaction between the civil society sphere and the formal politics sphere"&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"&gt;[Saad-Sulonen, J. The Role of the Creation and Sharing of Digital Media Content in Participatory E-Planning: International Journal of E-Planning Research 1, 1–22 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horelli and Wallin (2010), "participatory e-planning, similarly to e-participation, can be an important instrument of e-democracy and e-governance".&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; Participatory e-planning is also related to engaging the general public to use tools traditionally used by urban planning experts, such as [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] and Planning Support Systems.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;
Participatory e-planning research has focused on incorporating forms of participation with existing governance and urban planning processes. The e-planning research is also limited to needs of current participatory planning.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The original investigations used tools like online questionnaires, surveys, and polls to consultant citizens.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The feedback from participating citizens is then used or not used by experts and professionals. Before e-planning, citizens could provide only their opinion via direct confrontation, [[snail mail]], phone calls, or e-mails.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The e-planning participation tools allow for more organized and substantive participation from the interested public.
The tools are:

{{quote|1."Plans-on-the-map", which is a website that allows citizens to get acquainted with existing plans

2. "Tell-it-on-the-map", which is a questionnaire-based online tool to collect citizens' comments on specific issues presented by planners.

3. The planning competitions website, where citizens can get acquainted with ongoing planning competitions and comment on them.
&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;}}

These tools allow feedback, but still do not allow the public to spotlight issues they find important. Critiques challenge the e-planning tool to empower citizens to collaborate on the same level with experts. More and more citizens own devices that allow them to produce media. Participatory e-planning can not only use customary collaborative urban planning tools but must delve into sharing media content.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;

==Managing forests with participatory planning==
[[Forest management]] involves a variety of stakeholders, including the owners of the forest, locals, tourism enterprises, recreational uses, private or official conservationists, or the forest industry. Each of these parties has a different goal in using forests, which complicates planning.&lt;ref&gt;[Kangas, A., Kangas, Jyrki, Kurttila, Mikko. Decision Support for Forest Management. (Springer Science + Business Media B.V, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory approaches and computerized tools like [[Decision support system|decision support systems (DSS)]] have opposing views in sustainable forest management. Researchers question whether these tools can work together and/or combine with other tools to allow for positive participation.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"&gt;[Menzel, S. et al. Decision support systems in forest management: requirements from a participatory planning perspective. Eur J Forest Res 131, 1367–1379 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of DSS that may help participatory processes are the following: "group decision support, possibilities to include other values than timber production, flexibility of system to include non-traditional forest data and management options, and multi-criteria decision analysis tools.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"/&gt;"

==Examples==

===World Bank===
The community-driven development approach advocated by [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] is an example of participatory planning.

A number of examples link participatory community plans with [[local government]] planning. One widely applied example is [[South Africa]]'s national policy of community-based planning methodology, and an adapted version, the ''Harmonised Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Level Local Governments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khanya-aicdd.org/publications/CBP%20HPPG_for_Lower_Local%20Governments_0308.pdf/|publisher=Republic of Uganda Ministry of Local Government|title=Harmonized Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Local Governments|date=August 2003|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is national policy in Uganda. Community-Based Planning has been applied across the whole of [[Durban|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] in South Africa, including the City of Durban, and is being rolled out in [[Ekurhuleni Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality]].{{When|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For further information on community-based economic development in Uganda, South Africa, Ghana and Zimbabwe, visit the [http://www.khanya-aicdd.org African Institute for Community-Driven Development's website].&lt;/ref&gt; Community-Based Planning is an example of the practical application of the [[sustainable living]].

===Case Study: Britain in the 1940s===
After the bombing of British cities during World War II, planning advocates wanted to use the reconstruction planning as a way to engage the public.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"&gt;[Cowan, S. E. "Democracy, Technocracy and Publicity: Public Consultation and British Planning, 1939-1951. (2010). at &lt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jb4j9cz&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The planners wanted more authority in the political system to play a more substantive role within their democracy. The planners created new techniques to, "communicate with laypeople, including mobilizing publicity, measuring public opinion, organizing exhibitions, and experimenting with new visual strategies"&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt; They also developed a forum to educate and ask the public about various plans and policies.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt;

===Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood===
Cincinnati's [[Over-the-rhine|Over-The-Rhine's]] Comprehensive Plan was created in a participatory planning process, but its consistent monitoring of its implementation failed.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; Looking at Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, geographers saw potential logistical ways to obtain "necessary data, create a land-use GIS to analyze the data, update the data, and monitor the progress of the implementation of the Over-the Rhine Comprehensive Plan".&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; In the case of Cincinnati, it is proven that plans that are not carried out fail to live up to the participatory planning theory. Failures like that of the Over-the-Rhine plan make it harder for further progress toward plan's goal and objectives as well as muting the participants.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Ensuring that all sections of the community are able to participate is a challenge for participatory planning. Some approaches, such as Community-Based Planning, separate the community so that the livelihoods and preferred outcomes of different [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] can be identified.

Many experiences with ''participatory reflection and action'' and participatory planning suffer from a lack of follow-up. PRA has often not been part of a system, but an ''[[ad hoc]]'' process. Community-Based Planning has tried to overcome this by linking planning to the mainstream local government planning system.

Another challenge is caused by a lack of funds to actually implement the plans, which can lead to participation fatigue and frustration among communities. In the social-investment funds supported by the World Bank, participatory planning is often the first step, often leading to planning of infrastructure. In some cases, such as Community-Based Planning in South Africa, amounts of around{{Quantify|date=September 2010}} US$3,500 to $6,800 are provided to each ward to implement activities arising from the ward plan. This then stimulates more widespread community action.

==Organizations working in participatory planning==

===Center for Urban Pedagogy===
[[Center for Urban Pedagogy|The Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)]] in [[New york city|New York City]] "is a nonprofit organization that uses design and art to improve [[civic engagement]]".&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"&gt;[CUP: About. at http://welcometocup.org/About]&lt;/ref&gt; CUP projects aim to involve more individuals to work on policy and urban planning issues. CUP increases the public understanding of urban planning systems so that more of the community becomes involved. "CUP projects are collaborations of art and design professionals, community-based advocates and policymakers, and our staff"[9]. Together, these community members work on issues ranging from the [[Juvenile justice|juvenile justice system]] to [[Zoning law|zoning]] law to [[Food security#Access|food access]]. CUP takes these issues and simplifies them to accessible, visual interpretations.&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"/&gt; The tools created by CUP are used by New York City organizers and educators to push for better communities.

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

'''Paul Yeboah''', is an educator, farmer, permaculturist, community developer, and social entrepreneur. He is the founder and coordinator of the Ghana Permaculture Institute and Network  in Techiman, [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]]. It is located in the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]] of Ghana. The purpose of the Institute is to build and maintain a stable food system, to take care of the local ecosystems, and to improve the quality of life in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://permacultureghana.wordpress.com/what-is-permaculture-2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edge5.com.au/permaculture-courses-fremantle/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://uk.lush.com/article/paul-yeboah-and-gpi&lt;/ref&gt;
The GPN trains students and community in sustainable ecological farming techniques.  They support projects throughout Ghana; women groups, micro-finance projects; teach growing [[moringa]]; mushroom production; alley cropping, food forests development and [[Agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fiohnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PAUL-TESTIMONY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ecovillage.org/ghana-permaculture-institute/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Permaculture]] is based on natural sustainable design systems. An agricultural system that uses practices to keep soil fertile, crops and livestock healthy. It encourages protection of the environment and an environmental lifestyle; so as to maintain environmental stability and maintain environmental resources for the future.  It rehabilitates eroded and [[deforested]] land. The Permaculture Network encourages the practice of permaculture at home. The Permaculture Network's mission is to encourage, educate, and promote the use of permaculture by farmers and people in Ghana, which will contribute to the environmental soundness, and stability of the country's future.

They host international volunteers, interns, and students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/economy/artikel.php?ID=123567&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghana Permaculture Network and Institute is a member of the Ghana [[Ecovillage]] Network. Which is an organization of sustainable development leaders and projects. Paul Yeboah is Vice President of the GEN which works towards promoting Indigenous Initiatives and Sustainability in Ghana. Permaculture is transforming communities in Ghana through education, food production, outreach, skills development, self-sufficiency, and creating small business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;http://gen.ecovillage.org/en/gen-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.permaculture.co.uk/how-permaculture-is-transforming-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;



==Background==
At the age of 22 Paul Yeboah was concerned with rural and urban poverty. He received an Agricultural Certificate from the Farm Institute in Ghana. He initiated a rural and urban fruit forest project by using seed supplies from the Kade Oil Palm Research Institute and Bonsu Cocoa Research Station. The seeds and seedlings were given to the farmers on a credit basis. This project was instrumental in the creation of rural processing businesses and employment for the poor.

In 2003 Paul Yeboah was the farm manager for the Abbott of Kristo Buase Benedictine Monastery in Ghana. [[Greg Knibbs]] was invited to come to the Monastery to assist in the redesigning of the farm using Permaculture practices to restore the soil to fertility. The soil was depleted from the use of synthetic chemical pollution. Yeboah met Greg Knibbs and they worked together to form the Ghana Permaculture Network which later became the Ghana Permaculture Institute.

==Career==
The Ghana Permaculture Network was coordinated by Paul Yeboah in 2003. The GPN started out as a small farm demonstration training site that later grew into the Ghana Permaculture Institute (GPI).
In 2007 the Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery was created. It was created to build community income, and to deal with environmental issues such as [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. It also does [[reforestation]]. The work is collaborative community effort involving women, youth, and men. All members of the community are a part of the profits and benefits of working towards enhancing their environment. The project builds environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;http://permaculturenews.org/2011/11/01/the-ghana-permaculture-nwodua-tree-nursery-project-saving-lives-granting-livelihoods-and-restoring-eco-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Yeboah is the Vice Chairman of the Ghana Ecovillage Network which was founded in 2012, and incorporated in 2013. It was formed by community leaders and groups with sustainable projects to promote Ecovillage strategies as models for sustainable development in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;http://gen.ecovillage.org/en/gen-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana Permaculture Network started out supporting local schools, community farmers in establishing tree nurseries, and tree planting projects.  The Ghana Permaculture Network has now expanded in various parts of Ghana,  into Togo, and Burkina Faso in West Africa.

==Permaculture Institute Projects (Educational Programs)==
The goal of the educational initiatives and projects is to promote lifelong learning with emphases on vocational training, and the need of viable skill development using practices of sustainable development.
* Permaculture Design Courses are taught in Ghana, Togo and Burkina Faso, West Africa.
* Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery Project -  Ghana is a deforested country. The Tree Nursery Project addresses issues of deforestation in order to reverse erosion. It teaches and advocates the importance of trees and climate change issues.
* Oyster mushroom production -  Using sawdust in bags the Permaculture Institute teaches how to grow mushrooms. This project allows participants to learn how to make a waste product sawdust useful. Which promotes healthy diet, nutrition and skill development. 
* Demonstration Training sites for how-to build Permaculture home gardens
* Moringa Production - Which helps to facilitate the development of small-businesses to generate income. A project that promotes healthy nutrition and skills development.
* [[Ecovillage]] Design Course - Which teaches and acquaints students with tools that can be utilized to redevelop their communities in ecological economically, culturally and socially ways to foster sustainability.

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006.

'''Psychedelic art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist [[Humphry Osmond]]) means "mind manifesting".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".  In common parlance "psychedelic art" refers above all to the art movement of the late [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].  Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock music]].  Concert posters, album covers, [[liquid light shows]], liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration.  The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration.  Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations.  Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science.  Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud's theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally "turned on" by [[Albert Hofmann]]'s discovery of LSD.

The early examples of "psychedelic art" are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the [[Surrealist art]] movement, such as [[Remedios Varo]] and [[André Masson]]. It should also be noted that these came from writers involved in the Surrealist movement.  [[Antonin Artaud]] writes of his peyote experience in ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara'' (1937).  [[Henri Michaux]] wrote ''[[Misérable Miracle]]'' (1956), to describe his experiments with [[mescaline]] and also [[hashish]].

[[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (1954) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD.  For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research.  Hofmann saw the drug's potential for  poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer [[Ernst Jünger]]'s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist [[Oscar Janiger]].  Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist's choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD.  The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist.  The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture.  Beatnik poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a "complete disorientation of the senses" (to paraphrase [[Arthur Rimbaud]]).  They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine.  LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==
[[File:San Francisco Oracle Cover Vol.1 No.5, January 1967.jpg|thumb|Cover of the San Francisco Oracle, Volume 1 No.5, January 1967.]]
Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The "Fillmore Posters" were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist [[Bridget Riley]] became famous for her op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. [[Mati Klarwein]] created psychedelic masterpieces for [[Miles Davis|Miles Davis']] Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for [[Carlos Santana]] Latin Rock.  [[Pink Floyd]] worked extensively with London-based designers, [[Hipgnosis]] to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Warren Dayton]] and Art Bevacqua and New York artists [[Peter Max]] and [[Milton Glaser]] all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the [[Summer of Love]] focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the [[hippie]] counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion  that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.  The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  "Zap Comix" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], Victor Moscoso, [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.  [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, "The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]", whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself.  LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper.  Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs.  Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max.  A caption explains that each of Max's clocks "transposes time into multi-fantasy colors."&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm's length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''68/69 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1968. pgs. 45, 75, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Campbell's soup ran a poster promotion that promised to "Turn your wall souper-delic!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 798&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The art of peter max.jpg|thumb|The Art Of Peter Max]]

The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pgs. 443, 102, 76, 85, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pgs. 39, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Brian Wells explains, "The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Even the term "psychedelic" itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean "anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pgs. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Puns using the concept of "tripping" abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was "great on trips!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All-American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

==Digital age==

[[File:Juliasetsdkpictfield3.jpg|thumb|Fractal artwork created using the [[Julia set]]]]
[[Computer art]] has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision.  [[Fractal]] generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation.  Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The "digital revolution" was indeed heralded early on as the "New LSD" by none other than [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name="Leary, Horowitz &amp; Marshall 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Timothy Leary|Leary, Timothy]]; Horowitz, Michael; Marshall, Vicky| title = Chaos and Cyber Culture| publisher = Ronin Publishing| year = 1994| isbn = 0-914171-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthofer 1997"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Ruthofer, Arno|title = Think for Yourself; Question Authority|    year = 1997 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html  | accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Deep Dream Toast Sandwich.jpg|thumb|350px|[[DeepDream]] modified toast sandwich]]
The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies.  The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic [[poster art]], but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what [[digital art]] and [[computer graphics]] software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the [[convolutional neural network]] [[DeepDream]] finds and enhance patterns in images purely via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy).  Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and [[aesthetics]], particularly the aesthetics of [[Rave|rave culture]].  But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an [[entactogen]].  Development of new psychedelics such as [[2C-B]] and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]]) are truly psychedelic, and these novel psychedelics are fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist's vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia.  Well-known examples are [[Amanda Sage]], [[Alex Grey]], and [[Robert Venosa]].  These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are "psychedelic", are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization.  While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa. ''Introduction to Public Speaking.''{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Although there is evidence of public speech training in ancient [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=Morris M.|last2=Bernstein|first2=Elinor|title=Speech for Foreign Students|date=1990|publisher=C.C.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18409">A '''reception statute''' is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

The '''Ring of Brodgar''' (or '''Brogar''', or '''Ring o' Brodgar''') is a [[Neolithic]] [[henge]] and [[stone circle]] about 6 miles north-east of [[Stromness]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]], the largest island in [[Orkney]], Scotland. It is part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] known as the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]].

==General information==
The Ring of Brodgar (or Brogar, or Ring o' Brodgar) is a Neolithic [[henge]] and [[stone circle]] in [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney]], Scotland. Most henges do not contain stone circles; Brodgar is a striking exception, ranking with [[Avebury]] (and to a lesser extent [[Stonehenge]]) among the greatest of such sites.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1985, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The ring of stones stands on a small [[isthmus]] between the [[Loch of Stenness|Lochs of Stenness]] and [[Harray]]. These are the northernmost examples of circle henges in [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes 1986, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike similar structures such as Avebury, there are no obvious stones inside the circle,&lt;ref&gt;Hadingham, 1975, pp.55–56&lt;/ref&gt; but since the interior of the circle has never been excavated by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]], the possibility remains that wooden structures, for example, may have been present. The site has resisted attempts at scientific dating and the monument's age remains uncertain. It is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC, and was, therefore, the last of the great Neolithic monuments built on the Ness.&lt;ref name="orkneyjar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/brodgar/|title=The Ring of Brodgar, Stenness, Orkney|author=|date=|website=www.orkneyjar.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A project called The Ring of Brodgar Excavation 2008 was undertaken in the summer of that year in an attempt to settle the age issue and help answer other questions about a site that remains relatively poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/ringofbrodgar/background.htm The Ring of Brodgar Excavation 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the excavation are still preliminary.

The stone circle is {{convert|104|m|ft}} in diameter, and the third largest in the British Isles.&lt;ref name="orkneyjar" /&gt; The ring originally comprised up to 60 stones, of which only 27 remained standing at the end of the 20th century. The tallest stones stand at the south and west of the ring, including the so-called "Comet Stone" to the south-east.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;{{rp|42}} The stones are set within a circular ditch up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep, {{convert|9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|380|m|ft}} in circumference that was carved out of the solid sandstone bedrock by the ancient residents.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes 1986, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, this ditch does not constitute a true henge as there is no sign of an encircling bank of earth and rock. Many archaeologists continue to refer to this structure as a henge; for example, Aubrey Burl classifies the ditch as a Class II henge; one that has two opposing entrances, in this case on the north-west and south-east.&lt;ref&gt;Burl 1976, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The ditch appears to have been created in sections, possibly by workforces from different parts of Orkney. The stones may have been a later addition, maybe erected over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Examination of the immediate environs reveals a concentration of ancient sites, making a significant [[ritual landscape]]. Within {{convert|2|mi2|km2}} there are the two circle-henges, four chambered tombs, groups of standing stones, single stones, barrows, cairns, and mounds.&lt;ref&gt;Laing 1974, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate area has also yielded a number of flint arrowheads and broken stone mace-heads that seem to date from the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Childe 1952, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Although its exact purpose is not known, the proximity of the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]] and its [[Maeshowe]] tomb make the Ring of Brodgar a site of major importance. The site is a [[scheduled ancient monument]] and has been recognized as part of the "[[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]]" [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999.

==World Heritage status==
The [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] was inscribed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to the Ring of Brodgar, the site includes [[Maeshowe]], [[Skara Brae]], the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]] and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, whose 'Statement of Significance' for the site begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of civilisation...The Ring of Brodgar is the finest known truly circular late Neolithic or early Bronze Age stone ring and a later expression of the spirit which gave rise to Maeshowe, Stenness and Skara Brae&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/world_heritage_sites/world-heritage-neolithic-orkney.htm "The Heart of Neolithic Orkney"]. Historic Scotland. Retrieved on 5 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first formal survey of the Ring of Brodgar and surrounding antiquities was performed in 1849 by [[Royal Navy]] [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[F. W. L. Thomas|F.W.L. Thomas]] of HM [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] ''Woodlark''.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Thomas was in the area drawing up [[Admiralty Chart]]s in 1848–49, and he and his crew performed archaeological surveys as well resulting in the publication in 1852 of ''The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F.

===Excavations of Neolithic ruins===
[[File:Neolithic settlement at Brodgar (geograph 4125928).jpg|thumb|Neolithic settlement at Brodgar, (August 2014)]]
Ongoing excavations by [[Orkney College]] at the nearby [[Ness of Brodgar]] site located roughly midway between the Ring and the Stones of Stenness have uncovered several buildings, both ritual and domestic. Geophysics suggest there are likely to be more in the vicinity. Pottery, bones, stone tools and a polished stone mace head have also been discovered. Perhaps the most important find is the remains of a large stone wall which may have been {{convert|100|m|ft}} long and up to {{convert|6|m|ft}} wide. It appears to traverse the entire peninsula the site is on and may have been a symbolic barrier between the ritual landscape of the Ring and the mundane world around it.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, John (14 August 2007) "Experts uncover Orkney's new Skara Brae and the great wall that separated living from dead". Edinburgh. ''The Scotsman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nordic rites==
[[File:Brodgar woodcut.jpg|thumb|1823 woodcut, the Ring of Brodgar &amp; surroundings]]
Invaders from Scandinavia reached Orkney by the 9th century, bringing a complex theology that they imposed on the preexisting Orcadian monuments; at least according to local legend. For example, the Ring of Brodgar and the Standing Stones of Stenness were allegedly known as the Temple of the Sun and Moon respectively.&lt;ref name="Hedges"&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Young people supposedly made their vows and prayed to [[Wōden]] at these "temples" and at the so-called "Odin Stone" that lay between the stone circles until it was destroyed by a farmer in 1814.&lt;ref name="Hedges" /&gt; Others view these fanciful names with skepticism; Sigurd Towrie suggests that "they were simply erroneous terms applied by the antiquarians of the 18th or 19th centuries – romantic additions, in the same vein as the infamous "Druid's Circle" and "Sacrificial Altar"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/brodgar/temples.htm/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120131427/http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/brodgar/temples.htm/|archivedate=2017-01-20|title=The Temples of the Sun and Moon: True tradition or romantic addition?|accessdate=23 May 2018|website=Orkneyjar|author=Sigurd Towrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, several of the stones at Brodgar contain runic carvings that were left by [[Norsemen|Nordic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Laing 1974, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; These include the name "Bjorn" and a small cross as well as an anvil.&lt;ref name="Monuments"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham-Jones|first=Caroline|title=Monuments of Orkney|publisher=Historic Scotland|date=2012|isbn=978-1-84917-073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}

=="Megalithic Yard" and Neolithic astronomers at Brodgar==
Burl&lt;ref&gt;Burl 1976, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the diameter of the bank at Brodgar is almost exactly the same as the inner banks of the [[Avebury]] and [[Newgrange]] monuments in [[England]] and [[Ireland]] respectively, 125 so-called "[[megalithic yard]]s" (MY), at {{convert|0.8297|m|ft}} per MY. This is a controversial unit originally proposed by [[Alexander Thom]].&lt;ref&gt;Thom 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Thom's thesis, based on a statistical analysis of [[Neolithic]] monuments in the United Kingdom, is that the builders of these sites employed a common unit of measurement, although it has not been demonstrated how this information could have been shared:&lt;ref&gt;Burl 1976, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Pseudoscientific metrology]].

Heggie casts doubt on this as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered "little evidence for a highly accurate unit" and "little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use".&lt;ref&gt;Heggie 1981 p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Thom and his father made other controversial contentions, for example, that Brodgar and the burial mounds that surround it were designed specifically as backsights for astronomical observations of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Thom &amp; Thom 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Ritchie points out that the burial mounds have not been reliably dated, and he casts doubt on the astronomical prowess of the builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1985, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Euan MacKie suggested that the nearby [[village]] of [[Skara Brae]] might be the home of a privileged theocratic class of wise men who engaged in astronomical and magical ceremonies at sites like Brodgar and Stenness.&lt;ref&gt;MacKie 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Graham and Anna Ritchie cast doubt on this interpretation noting that there is no archaeological evidence for the claim,&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1981, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; although a Neolithic "low road" connects Skara Brae with the chambered tomb of Maeshowe, passing near Brodgar and Stenness.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 1987, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Low roads connect Neolithic ceremonial sites throughout Britain.

==Cultural impact==

The Ring of Brodgar features in [[Kathleen Fidler]]'s 1968 novel ''The Boy with the Bronze Axe''; here, it is depicted in a midsummer ceremony in which a lamb is sacrificed. In Fidler's story, women are forbidden from entering the Ring, which is a male-only space.{{sfn|Bramwell|2009|p=184}}

In [[Troika Games]] 2001 title ''[[Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura]]'', the Ring of Brodgar appears in the town of Roseborough and is pivotal to the plot.

'''''SAMUS: South African Music Studies''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[South African Society for Research in Music]] (SASRIM). Contents and abstracts are listed in [[RILM]] Abstracts, The Music Index, Sabinet Online, and [[African Journals OnLine]].

'''''SAMUS''''' succeeds the now defunct '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' which was published by the former [[Musicological Society of Southern Africa]]. SASRIM is a post-apartheid amalgamation of the Musicological Society of Southern Africa and the Ethnomusicology Symposium. Consequently '''''SAMUS''''' is an interdisciplinary journal, which publishes an eclectic range of research in the disciplines of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory and analysis, popular music, composition, performance, music therapy, and music education. The journal is published once a year.

Notable music researchers who have published in both the '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' and '''''SAMUS''''' include Christopher Ballantine, [[John Blacking]], [[Michael Blake (composer)|Michael Blake]], Sylvia Bruinders, [[Nicholas Cook]], David Coplan, Lindelwa Dalamba, Chatradari Devroop, Michael Drewett, Veit Erlmann, [[Robert Fokkens]], Klaus Heimes, Marie Jorritsma, [[Clare Loveday]], Christine Lucia, Winfried Lüdemann, J.P Malan, James May, Stephanus Muller, Grant Olwage, Beverly Parker, [[Roger Parker]], Mary Rörich, Martin Scherzinger, Ruth A.

[[File:Juniperus communis range map.gif|thumb|300px|A [[range (biology)|species range]] map represents the region where individuals of a species can be found. This is a range map of ''[[Juniperus communis]]'', the common [[juniper]].]]

'''Species distribution''' is the manner in which a biological [[taxon]] is spatially arranged. The geographic limits of a particular taxon's distribution is its '''range''', often represented as shaded areas on a map. Patterns of distribution change depending the scale at which they are viewed, from the arrangement of individuals within a small family unit, to patterns within a population, or the distribution of the entire [[species]] as a whole (range). Species distribution is not to be confused with [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], which is the movement of individuals away from their [[center of origin|region of origin]] or from a population center of high [[population density|density]].

==Range==
In [[biology]], the '''range''' of a [[species]] is the geographical area within which that species can be found. Within that range, '''distribution''' is the general structure of the species [[population]], while dispersion is the variation in its [[population density]].

Range is often described with the following qualities:
* Sometimes a distinction is made between a species' natural, [[endemism|endemic]], [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], or '''native range''', where it has historically originated and lived, and the range where a species has more recently established itself. Many terms are used to describe the new range, such as non-native, naturalized, [[introduced species|introduced]], transplanted, [[invasive species|invasive]], or colonized range.&lt;ref name=col2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Colautti |first1=Robert I. |first2=Hugh J. |last2=MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define ‘invasive’ species |work=Diversity and Distributions |volume=10 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=135–41 |issn=1366-9516 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/502_reading/Colautti2004.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Introduced'' typically means that a species has been transported by humans (intentionally or accidentally) across a major geographical barrier.&lt;ref name=rich2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richardson |first1=David M. |last2=Pysek |first2=Petr |last3=Rejmanek |first3=Marcel |last4=Barbour |first4=Michael G. |last5=Panetta |first5=F. Dane |last6=West |first6=Carol J. |title=Naturalization and invasion of alien plants: concepts and definitions |work=Diversity and Distributions |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=93–107 |issn=1366-9516 |doi=10.1046/j.1472-4642.2000.00083.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For species found in different regions at different times of year, especially [[season]]s, terms such as '''summer range''' and '''winter range''' are often employed.
* For species for which only part of their range is used for breeding activity, the terms '''breeding range''' and '''non-breeding range''' are used.
* For mobile animals, the term '''natural range''' is often used, as opposed to areas where it occurs as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]].
* Geographic or temporal qualifiers are often added, such as in ''British range'' or ''pre-1950 range''. The typical geographic ranges could be the latitudinal range and [[elevation]]al range.

[[Disjunct distribution]] occurs when two or more areas of the range of a taxon are considerably separated from each other geographically.

==Factors affecting distribution==
Distribution patterns may change by [[season]], distribution by humans, in response to the availability of resources, and other [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[Abiotic component|biotic]] factors.
===Abiotic===
There are three main types of abiotic factors:
#climatic factors consist of sunlight, atmosphere, humidity, temperature, and salinity;
#[[edaphic]] factors are abiotic factors regarding soil, such as the coarseness of soil, local geology, soil pH, and aeration; and
#social factors include land use and water availability. 

An example of the effects of abiotic factors on species distribution can be seen in drier areas, where most individuals of a species will gather around water sources, forming a clumped distribution.

Researchers from the Arctic Ocean Diversity (ARCOD) project have documented rising numbers of warm-water crustaceans in the seas around Norway's Svalbard Islands. Arcod is part of the Census of Marine Life, a huge 10-year project involving researchers in more than 80 nations that aims to chart the diversity, distribution and abundance of life in the oceans. Marine Life has become largely affected by increasing [[effects of global warming]]. This study shows that as the ocean temperatures rise species are beginning to travel into the cold and harsh Arctic waters. Even the snow crab has extended its range 500&amp;nbsp;km north.

===Biotic===
Biotic factors such as predation, disease, and competition for resources such as food, water, and mates, can also affect how a species is distributed. For example, biotic factors in a quail’s environment would include their prey (insects and seeds), competition from other quail, and their predators, such as the coyote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Biotic_factor|title=Biotic factor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of a herd, community, or other clumped distribution allows a population to detect predators earlier, at a greater distance, and potentially mount an effective defense. Due to limited resources, populations may be evenly distributed to minimize competition,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece. Biology. eight edition&lt;/ref&gt; as is found in forests, where competition for sunlight produces an even distribution of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Abiotic_factor|title=Abiotic factor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human impact on the environment|Humans]] are one of the largest distributors due to the current trends in [[globalization]] and the expanse of the [[transportation]] industry. For example, large [[tanker (ship)|tankers]] often fill their ballasts with water at one port and empty them in another, causing a wider distribution of aquatic species.

==Patterns on large scales==
On large scales, the pattern of distribution among individuals in a population is clumped.&lt;ref name=molles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Molles, Jr. |first1=Manuel C. |title=Ecology:  concepts and applications |date=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |isbn=9780073050829 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird wildlife corridors===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
One common example of bird species' ranges are land mass areas bordering water bodies, such as oceans, rivers, or lakes; they are called a ''coastal strip''. A second example, some species of bird depend on water, usually a river, swamp, etc., or water related forest and live in a ''river corridor''. A separate example of a river corridor would be a river corridor that includes the entire drainage, having the edge of the range delimited by mountains, or higher elevations; the river itself would be a smaller percentage of this entire wildlife corridor, but the corridor is created because of the river.

A further example of a bird wildlife corridor would be a mountain range corridor. In the U.S. of North America, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in the west, and the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the east are two examples of this habitat, used in summer, and winter, by separate species, for different reasons.

Bird species in these corridors are connected to a main range for the species (contiguous range) or are in an isolated geographic range and be a [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] range. Birds leaving the area, if they [[bird migration|migrate]], would leave connected to the main range or have to fly over land not connected to the wildlife corridor; thus, they would be [[passage migrant]]s over land that they stop on for an intermittent, hit or miss, visit.
==Patterns on small scales==
[[File:Population distribution.svg|thumb|right|Three basic types of population distribution within a [[range (biology)|regional range]] are (from top to bottom) uniform, random, and clumped.]]

On large scales, the pattern of distribution among individuals in a population is clumped. On small scales, the pattern may be clumped, regular, or random.&lt;ref name=molles/&gt;

===Clumped===
Clumped distribution is the most common type of dispersion found in nature. In clumped distribution, the distance between neighboring individuals is minimized. This type of distribution is found in environments that are characterized by patchy resources. Animals need certain resources to survive, and when these resources become rare during certain parts of the year animals tend to “clump” together around these crucial resources. Individuals might be clustered together in an area due to social factors such as [[selfish herd]]s and family groups. Organisms that usually serve as prey form clumped distributions in areas where they can hide and detect predators easily.

Other causes of clumped distributions are the inability of offspring to independently move from their habitat. This is seen in juvenile animals that are immobile and strongly dependent upon parental care. For example, the [[bald eagle]]'s nest of eaglets exhibits a clumped species distribution because all the offspring are in a small subset of a survey area before they learn to fly. Clumped distribution can be beneficial to the individuals in that group. However, in some herbivore cases, such as cows and wildebeests, the vegetation around them can suffer, especially if animals target one plant in particular.

Clumped distribution in species acts as a mechanism against predation as well as an efficient mechanism to trap or corner prey. African wild dogs, ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'', use the technique of communal hunting to increase their success rate at catching prey. Studies have shown that larger packs of African wild dogs tend to have a greater number of successful kills. A prime example of clumped distribution due to patchy resources is the wildlife in Africa during the dry season; lions, hyenas, giraffes, elephants, gazelles, and many more animals are clumped by small water sources that are present in the severe dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Creel | first = N.M. and S. | title = Communal Hunting and Pack Size in African Wild Dogs, ''Lycaon pictus'' | journal = Animal Behaviour | year = 1995 | pages = 1325–1339|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80048-4 | volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been observed that extinct and threatened species are more likely to be clumped in their distribution on a phylogeny. The reasoning behind this is that they share traits that increase vulnerability to extinction because related taxa are often located within the same broad geographical or habitat types where human-induced threats are concentrated. Using recently developed complete phylogenies for mammalian carnivores and primates it has been shown that the majority of instances threatened species are far from randomly distributed among [[taxa]] and [[phylogenetic]] [[clade]]s and display clumped distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Purvis | first1 = A | last2 = Agapowe | first2 = P-M | last3 = Gittleman | first3 = JL | last4 = Mace | first4 = GM | year = 2000 | title = Non-random extinction and the loss of evolutionary history | url = | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = | pages = 328–330 | doi=10.1126/science.288.5464.328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contiguous distribution is one in which individuals are closer together than they would be if they were randomly or evenly distributed, i.e., it is clumped distribution with a single clump. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fishbase.de/glossary/Glossary.php?q=aggregated%2Fclumped%2Fcontiguous+distribution "Aggregated/clumped/contiguous distribution"], &lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular or uniform===
Less common than clumped distribution, uniform distribution, also known as even distribution, is evenly spaced. Uniform distributions are found in populations in which the distance between neighboring individuals is maximized. The need to maximize the space between individuals generally arises from competition for a resource such as moisture or nutrients, or as a result of direct social interactions between individuals within the population, such as territoriality. For example, penguins often exhibit uniform spacing by aggressively defending their territory among their neighbors. The burrows of [[great gerbil]]s for example are also regularly distributed,&lt;ref name="Wilschut 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I|last2=Laudisoit|first2=A.|last3=Hughes|first3=N.K|last4=Addink|first4=E.A.|last5=de Jong|first5=S.M.|last6=Heesterbeek|first6=J.A.P.|last7=Reijniers|first7=J.|last8=Eagle|first8=S.|last9=Dubyanskiy|first9=V.M.|last10=Begon|first10=M.|title=Spatial distribution patterns of plague hosts: point pattern analysis of the burrows of great gerbils in Kazakhstan|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=19 May 2015|volume=42|issue=7|pages=1281–1292|doi=10.1111/jbi.12534|pmc=4737218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen on satellite images.&lt;ref name="Wilschut 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilschut|first1=L.I|last2=Addink|first2=E.A.|last3=Heesterbeek|first3=J.A.P.|last4=Dubyanskiy|first4=V.M|last5=Davis|first5=S.A.|last6=Laudisoit|first6=A.|last7=Begon|first7=M.|last8=Burdelov|first8=L.A.|last9=Atshabar|first9=B.B.|last10=de Jong|first10=S.M.|title=Mapping the distribution of the main host for plague in a complex landscape in Kazakhstan: An object-based approach using SPOT-5 XS, Landsat 7 ETM+, SRTM and multiple Random Forests|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|date=2013|volume=23|pages=81–94|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also exhibit uniform distributions, like the creosote bushes in the southwestern region of the United States. ''[[Salvia leucophylla]]'' is a species in California that naturally grows in uniform spacing. This flower releases chemicals called [[terpenes]] which inhibit the growth of other plants around it and results in uniform distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mauseth | first = James | authorlink = James Mauseth | title = Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology | publisher = [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2008 | pages = 596 | isbn = 0-7637-5345-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[allelopathy]], which is the release of chemicals from plant parts by leaching, root exudation, volatilization, residue decomposition and other processes. Allelopathy can have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on surrounding organisms. Some allelochemicals even have selective effects on surrounding organisms; for example, the tree species ''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'' exudes a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants but not those of its own species, and thus can affect the distribution of specific rival species. Allelopathy usually results in uniform distributions, and its potential to suppress weeds is being researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Fergusen | first= J.J |author2=Rathinasabapathi, B | title= Allelopathy: How Plants Suppress Other Plants | url= http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/HS186 | year= 2003| work= | publisher= | accessdate=2009-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and agricultural practices often create uniform distribution in areas where it would not previously exist, for example, orange trees growing in rows on a plantation.

===Random===
Random distribution, also known as unpredictable spacing, is the least common form of distribution in nature and occurs when the members of a given species are found in environments in which the position of each individual is independent of the other individuals: they neither attract nor repel one another. Random distribution is rare in nature as biotic factors, such as the interactions with neighboring individuals, and abiotic factors, such as climate or soil conditions, generally cause organisms to be either clustered or spread. Random distribution usually occurs in habitats where environmental conditions and resources are consistent. This pattern of dispersion is characterized by the lack of any strong social interactions between species. For example; When [[dandelion]] [[seeds]] are dispersed by wind, random distribution will often occur as the seedlings land in random places determined by uncontrollable factors. Oyster larvae can also travel hundreds of kilometers powered by sea currents, which can result in their random distribution.

==Statistical determination of distribution patterns==
There are various ways to determine the distribution pattern of species. The [[Clark–Evans nearest neighbor method]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|title=Distance to Nearest Neighbor as a Measure of Spatial Relationships in Populations
|author=Philip J. Clark and Francis C. Evans
|journal=Ecology
|volume= 35
|issue=4
|date=Oct 1954
|pages= 445–453
|publisher= Ecological Society of America
|doi=10.2307/1931034}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to determine if a distribution is clumped, uniform, or random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blackith | first = R. E. | title = Nearest-Neighbour Distance Measurements for the Estimation of Animal Populations | publisher = Ecology | year = 1958 | pages = 147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To utilize the Clark–Evans nearest neighbor method, researchers examine a population of a single species. The distance of an individual to its nearest neighbor is recorded for each individual in the sample. For two individuals that are each other's nearest neighbor, the distance is recorded twice, once for each individual. To receive accurate results, it is suggested that the number of distance measurements is at least 50. The average distance between nearest neighbors is compared to the expected distance in the case of random distribution to give the ratio:

: &lt;math&gt;R = (\text{mean distance}) \times 2\sqrt{\text{density}}&lt;/math&gt;

If this ratio ''R'' is equal to 1, then the population is randomly dispersed. If ''R'' is significantly greater than&amp;nbsp;1, the population is evenly dispersed. Lastly, if ''R'' is significantly less than&amp;nbsp;1, the population is clumped. Statistical tests (such as t-test, chi squared, etc.) can then be used to determine whether ''R'' is significantly different from&amp;nbsp;1.

The variance/mean ratio method focuses mainly on determining whether a species fits a randomly spaced distribution, but can also be used as evidence for either an even or clumped distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Banerjee | first = B. | title = Variance to mean ratio and the spatial distribution of animals | publisher = Birkhäuser Basel | year = 1976 | pages = 993–994}}&lt;/ref&gt; To utilize the Variance/Mean ratio method, data is collected from several random samples of a given population. In this analysis, it is imperative that data from at least 50 sample plots is considered. The number of individuals present in each sample is compared to the expected counts in the case of random distribution. The expected distribution can be found using [[Poisson distribution]]. If the variance/mean ratio is equal to 1, the population is found to be randomly distributed. If it is significantly greater than 1, the population is found to be clumped distribution. Finally, if the ratio is significantly less than 1, the population is found to be evenly distributed. Typical statistical tests used to find the significance of the variance/mean ratio include [[Student's t-test]] and [[Chi-squared test|chi squared]].

However, many researchers believe that species distribution models based on statistical analysis, without including ecological models and theories, are too incomplete for prediction. Instead of conclusions based on presence-absence data, probabilities that convey the likelihood a species will occupy a given area are more preferred because these models include an estimate of confidence in the likelihood of the species being present/absent. Additionally, they are also more valuable than data collected based on simple presence or absence because models based on probability allow the formation of spatial maps that indicates how likely a species is to be found in a particular area. Similar areas can then be compared to see how likely it is that a species will occur there also; this leads to a relationship between habitat suitability and species occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ormerod | first = S.J. |author2=Vaughan, I.P. | year = 2005 | title = The continuing challenges of testing species distribution models | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 720–730 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118735253/abstract | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01052.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species distribution models==
{{see also|Environmental niche modelling}}

Species distribution can be predicted based on the pattern of biodiversity at spatial scales. A general hierarchical model can integrate disturbance, dispersal and population dynamics. Based on factors of dispersal, disturbance, resources limiting climate, and other species distribution, predictions of species distribution can create a bio-climate range, or bio-climate envelope. The envelope can range from a local to a global scale or from a density independence to dependence. The hierarchical model takes into consideration the requirements, impacts or resources as well as local extinctions in disturbance factors. Models can integrate the dispersal/migration model, the disturbance model, and abundance model. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to assess climate change impacts and conservation management issues. Species distribution models include: presence/absence models, the dispersal/migration models, disturbance models, and abundance models. A prevalent way of creating predicted distribution maps for different species is to reclassify a land cover layer depending on whether or not the species in question would be predicted to habit each cover type. This simple SDM is often modified through the use of range data or ancillary information, such as elevation or water distance.

Recent studies have indicated that the grid size used can have an effect on the output of these species distribution models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~ebuford/MB_species1.html|title=Species Distribution Modeling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard 50x50 km grid size can select up to 2.89 times more area than when modeled with a 1x1 km grid for the same species. This has several effects on the species conservation planning under climate change predictions (global climate models, which are frequently used in the creation of species distribution models, usually consist of 50–100&amp;nbsp;km size grids) which could lead to over-prediction of future ranges in species distribution modeling. This can result in the misidentification of protected areas intended for a species future habitat.

==Species Distribution Grids Project==
The Species Distribution Grids Project is an effort led out of the University of Columbia to create maps and databases of the whereabouts of various animal species. This work is centered on preventing deforestation and prioritizing areas based on species richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsky.org/radioshows/52945/malanding-jaiteh-on-where-species-live |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414020826/http://www.earthsky.org/radioshows/52945/malanding-jaiteh-on-where-species-live |archivedate=2009-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2009, data are available for global amphibian distributions, as well as birds and mammals in the Americas.

'''Statistical language acquisition''', is a branch of [[developmental psychology|developmental]] [[psycholinguistics]], that studies the process by which humans develop the ability to perceive, produce, comprehend, and communicate with [[natural language]] in all of its aspects ([[phonology|phonological]], [[syntax|syntactic]], [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[semantics|semantic]]) through the use of general learning mechanisms operating on statistical patterns in the linguistic input.  [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|Statistical learning]] acquisition claims that infants language learning is based on pattern perception rather than an innate biological grammar. Several statistical elements such as frequency of words, frequent frames, phonotactic patterns and other regularities provide information on language structure and meaning for facilitation of language acquisition.

==Philosophy==
Fundamental to the study of statistical language acquisition is the centuries-old debate between [[rationalism]] (or its modern manifestation in the psycholinguistic community, [[psychological nativism|nativism]]) and [[empiricism]], with researchers in this field falling strongly in support of the latter category. Nativism is the position that humans are born with innate [[domain specificity|domain-specific]] knowledge, especially inborn capacities for language learning. Ranging from seventeenth century rationalist philosophers such as [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard Montague]] and linguists such as [[Noam Chomsky]], nativists posit an innate learning mechanism with the specific function of language acquisition.&lt;ref name = "philo"&gt;Russell, J. (2004). What is Language Development?: Rationalist, Empiricist, and Pragmatist Approaches to the Acquisition of Syntax. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, this debate has largely surrounded Chomsky's support of a [[universal grammar]], properties that all natural languages must have, through the controversial postulation of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), an instinctive mental 'organ' responsible for language learning which searches all possible language alternatives and chooses the parameters that best match the learner's environmental linguistic input. Much of Chomsky's theory is founded on the [[poverty of the stimulus]] (POTS) argument, the assertion that a child's linguistic data is so limited and corrupted that learning language from this data alone is impossible. As an example, many proponents of POTS claim that because children are never exposed to negative evidence, that is, information about what phrases are ungrammatical, the language structure they learn would not resemble that of correct speech without a language-specific learning mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1965). Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chomsky's argument for an internal system responsible for language, biolinguistics, poses a three factor model.  "Genetic endowment" allows the infant to extract linguistic info, detect rules, and have universal grammar.  "External environment" illuminates the need to interact with others and the benefits of language exposure at an early age.  The last factor encompasses the brain properties, learning principles, and computational efficiencies that enable children to pick up on language rapidly using patterns and strategies.

Standing in stark contrast to this position is empiricism, the [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. This school of thought often characterizes the nascent mind as a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, and can in many ways be associated with the nurture perspective of the "[[nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture debate]]". This viewpoint has a long historical tradition that parallels that of rationalism, beginning with seventeenth century empiricist philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Hobbes]], and, in the following century, [[David Hume|Hume]]. The basic tenet of empiricism is that information in the environment is structured enough that its patterns are both detectable and extractable by domain-general learning mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "philo"/&gt; In terms of [[language acquisition]], these patterns can be either linguistic or social in nature.

Chomsky is very critical of this empirical theory of language acquisition. He has said, "It's true there's been a lot of work on trying to apply statistical models to various linguistic problems. I think there have been some successes, but a lot of failures." He claims the idea of using statistical methods to acquire language is simply a mimicry of the process, rather than a true understanding of how language is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;http://norvig.com/chomsky.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental paradigms==

===Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)===
One of the most used experimental [[paradigm]]s in investigations of infants' capacities for statistical language acquisition is the Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP), developed by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] psychologist [[Anne Fernald]] in 1985 to study infants' preferences for prototypical [[baby talk|child-directed speech]] over normal adult speech.&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, A. (1985). Four-Month-Old Infants Prefer to Listen to Motherese ". Infant Behavior and Development, 181-195.&lt;/ref&gt; In the classic HPP paradigm, infants are allowed to freely turn their heads and are seated between two speakers with mounted lights. The light of either the right or left speaker then flashes as that speaker provides some type of audial or linguistic input stimulus to the infant. Reliable orientation to a given side is taken to be an indication of a preference for the input associated with that side's speaker. This paradigm has since become increasingly important in the study of [[Speech perception#Infant speech perception|infant speech perception]], especially for input at levels higher than [[syllable]] chunks, though with some modifications, including using the listening times instead of the side preference as the relevant dependent measure.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swingley | first1 = D | year = 2009 | title = Contributions of infant word learning to language development | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1536| pages = 3617–32 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2009.0107 | pmid = 19933136 | pmc = 2828984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditioned Headturn Procedure===
Similar to HPP, the Conditioned Headturn Procedure also makes use of an infant's differential preference for a given side as an indication of a preference for, or more often a familiarity with, the input or speech associated with that side. Used in studies of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] boundary markers by Gout et al. (2004)&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; and later by Werker in her classic studies of [[categorical perception]] of [[first language|native-language]]  [[phoneme]]s,&lt;ref name = "werker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Lalonde | first2 = C. E. | year = 1988 | title = Cross-Language Speech Perception : Initial Capabilities and Developmental Change | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 672–683 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.5.672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.460.9810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; infants are [[classical conditioning|conditioned]] by some attractive image or display to look in one of two directions every time a certain input is heard, a whole word in Gout's case and a single phonemic syllable in Werker's. After the conditioning, new or more complex input is then presented to the infant, and their ability to detect the earlier target word or distinguish the input of the two trials is observed by whether they turn their head in expectation of the conditioned display or not.

===Anticipatory eye movement===
While HPP and the Conditioned Headturn Procedure allow for observations of behavioral responses to stimuli and after the fact inferences about what the subject's expectations must have been to motivate this behavior, the Anticipatory Eye Movement paradigm allows researchers to directly observe a subject's expectations before the event occurs. By [[eye tracking|tracking]] subjects' [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]] researchers have been able to investigate infant [[decision-making]] and the ways in which infants encode and act on [[probabilistic logic|probabilistic knowledge]] to make predictions about their environments.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, S. J., Newport, E. L., &amp; Aslin, R. N. (2009). Probability-matching in 10-month-old infants. Methods.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm also offers the advantage of comparing differences in eye movement behavior across a wider range of ages than others.

===Artificial languages===
[[Artificial language]]s, that is, small-scale languages that typically have an extremely limited [[vocabulary]] and simplified [[grammar]] rules, are a commonly used paradigm for [[psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] researchers. Artificial languages allow researchers to isolate variables of interest and wield a greater degree of control over the input the subject will receive. Unfortunately, the overly simplified nature of these languages and the absence of a number of phenomena common to all human natural languages such as [[rhythm]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]] changes, and sequential regularities raise questions of [[external validity]] for any findings obtained using this paradigm, even after attempts have been made to increase the [[complexity]] and richness of the languages used.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hay | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Pelucchi | first2 = B. | last3 = Estes | first3 = K. G. | last4 = Saffran | first4 = J. R. | year = 2011 | title = Linking sounds to meanings: Infant statistical learning in a natural language | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 93–106 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2011.06.002 | pmid = 21762650 | pmc = 3143199 | bibcode = 1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artificial language's lack of complexity or decreased complexity fails to account for a child's need to recognize a given syllable in natural language regardless of the sound variability inherent to natural language, though "it is possible that the complexity of natural language actually facilitates learning."&lt;ref name = "statlearn"&gt;Romberg, A. R., &amp; Saffran, J. R. (2010). Statistical learning and language acquisition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. WIREs Cognitive Science. http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/infantlearning/Publications_files/Romberg.Saffran.2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, artificial language experiments are typically conducted to explore what the relevant linguistic variables are, what sources of information infants are able to use and when, and how researchers can go about modeling the [[learning]] and acquisition process.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; [[Richard N. Aslin|Aslin]] and [[Elissa L. Newport|Newport]], for example, have used artificial languages to explore what features of linguistic input make certain [[pattern]]s salient and easily detectable by infants, allowing them to easily contrast the detection of syllable repetition with that of word-final syllables and make conclusions about the conditions under which either feature is recognized as important.&lt;ref name = "general"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aslin | first1 = R. N. | last2 = Newport | first2 = E. L. | year = 2012 | title = Statistical Learning : From Acquiring Specific Items to Forming General Rules | url = | journal = Distribution | volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 170–176| doi = 10.1177/0963721412436806 | pmid = 24000273 | pmc = 3758750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio and audiovisual recordings===
Statistical learning has been shown to play a large role in language acquisition, but social interaction appears to be a necessary component of learning as well. In one study, infants presented with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers failed to distinguish the phonemes of the language.&lt;ref name = "crackingcode"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = Patricia K | year = 2004 | title = Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 831–843 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1533 | pmid=15496861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "social learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhl | first1 = Patricia K | year = 2007 | title = Is speech learning "gated" by the social brain | url = http://ilabs.washington.edu/kuhl/pdf/Kuhl_2007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 11–120 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00572.x | pmid = 17181708 | bibcode = 2003DevSc...6...72N }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This implies that simply hearing the sounds is not sufficient for language learning; social interaction cues the infant to take statistics. Particular interactions geared towards infants is known as "child-directed" language because it is more repetitive and associative, which makes it easier to learn. These "child directed" interactions could also be the reason why it is easier to learn a language as a child rather than an adult.

===Bilinguals===
Studies of bilingual infants, such as a study Bijeljac-Babic, et al., on French-learning infants, have offered insight to the role of prosody in language acquisition.&lt;ref name = "bijeljac-babic"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bibeljac-Babic | first1 = Ranka | last2 = Serres | first2 = Josette | last3 = Höhle | first3 = Barbara | last4 = Nazzi | first4 = Thierry | year = 2012 | title = Effect of Bilingualism on Lexical Stress Pattern Discrimination in French-Learning Infants | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume =  7| issue = 2| page =  e30843| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0030843 | pmid = 22363500 | pmc = 3281880 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...730843B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bijeljac-Babic study found that language dominance influences "sensitivity to prosodic contrasts." Although this was not a study on statistical learning, its findings on prosodic pattern recognition might have implications for statistical learning.

It is possible that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues that one has already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Important findings==

===Phonetic category learning===
The first step in developing knowledge of a system as complex as natural language is learning to distinguish the important language-specific classes of sounds, called phonemes, that distinguish meaning between words. [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] psychologist [[Janet Werker]], since her influential series of experiments in the 1980s, has been one of the most prominent figures in the effort to understand the process by which human babies develop these phonological distinctions. While adults who speak different languages are unable to distinguish meaningful sound differences in other languages that do not delineate different meanings in their own, babies are born with the ability to universally distinguish all speech sounds. Werker's work has shown that while infants at six to eight months are still able to perceive the difference between certain [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]]  [[consonant]]s, they have completely lost this ability by 11 to 13 months.&lt;ref name = "werker"/&gt;

It is now commonly accepted that children use some form of perceptual [[distributional hypothesis|distributional learning]], by which categories are discovered by clumping similar instances of an input stimulus, to form phonetic categories early in life.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Developing children have been found to be effective judges of linguistic authority, screening the input they model their language on by shifting their [[attention]] less to speakers who mispronounce words.&lt;ref name = "review" /&gt;   Infants also use statistical tracking to calculate the likelihood that particular phonemes will follow each other.&lt;ref name = "Romberg/saffron"&gt; Romberg, Alexa R and Sarron, Jenny R. (2010). "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112001/ Statistical Learning and Language Acquisition]."  WIREs Cogn Sci 10.1002/wbs.78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing===
[[Parsing]] is the process by which a continuous speech stream is segmented into its [[:wikt:discrete|discrete]] meaningful units, e.g. [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], [[word]]s, and syllables. [[Jenny Saffran|Saffran]] (1996) represents a singularly seminal study in this line of research. Infants were presented with two minutes of continuous speech of an artificial language from a computerized voice to remove any interference from [[extraneous variable]]s such as prosody or [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. After this presentation, infants were able to distinguish words from nonwords, as measured by longer looking times in the second case.&lt;ref name = "saffran"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926 |pmid=8943209 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1926S |title=Statistical Learning by 8-Month-Old Infants |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5294 |pages=1926-8 |last1=Saffran |first1=Jenny R |last2=Aslin |first2=Richard N |last3=Newport |first3=Elissa L |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important concept in understanding these results is that of [[markov chain|transitional probability]], the [[likelihood]] of an element, in this case a syllable, following or preceding another element. In this experiment, syllables that went together in words had a much higher transitional probability than did syllables at [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] that just happened to be adjacent.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "saffran"/&gt; Incredibly, infants, after a short two-minute presentation, were able to keep track of these [[statistics]] and recognize high [[probability]] words. Further research has since replicated these results with natural languages unfamiliar to infants, indicating that learning infants also keep track of the direction (forward or backward) of the transitional probabilities.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt; Though the neural processes behind this phenomenon remain largely unknown, recent research reports increased activity in the [[Inferior frontal gyrus|left inferior frontal gyrus]] and the [[middle frontal gyrus]] during the detection of word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNealy | first1 = K | last2 = Mazziotta | first2 = JC | last3 = Dapretto | first3 = M | year = 2006 | title = Cracking the language code: Neural mechanisms underlying speech parsing | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 26 | issue = 29| pages = 7629–7639 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.5501-05.2006| pmid = 16855090 | pmc = 3713232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of syllable-ordering biases is an important step along the way to full language development. The ability to categorize syllables and group together frequently [[co-occurrence|co-occurring]] sequences may be critical in the development of a ''protolexicon'', a set of common language-specific word templates based on characteristic patterns in the words an infant hears. The development of this protolexicon may in turn allow for the recognition of new types of patterns, e.g. the high frequency of word-initially [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] consonants in English, which would allow infants to further parse words by recognizing common prosodic phrasings as autonomous linguistic units, restarting the dynamic cycle of word and language learning.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

===Referent-label associations===
The question of how novice language-users are capable of associating learned [[name|labels]] with the appropriate [[referent]], the person or object in the environment which the label names, has been at the heart of [[philosophy|philosophical]] considerations of [[philosophy of language|language]] and [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] from [[Plato]] to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, M.H., &amp; Lamb, M.E. (Eds.). (2011). Developmental Science: An Advanced Textbook. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This problem, that of finding some solid relationship between word and object, of finding a word's [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] without succumbing to an infinite recursion of dictionary look-up, is known as the [[symbol grounding|symbol grounding problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 42 | issue = 1–3| pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have shown that this problem is intimately linked with the ability to parse language, and that those words that are easy to segment due to their high transitional probabilities are also easier to [[conceptual metaphor|map]] to an appropriate referent.&lt;ref name = "soundtomeaning"/&gt; This serves as further evidence of the developmental progression of language acquisition, with children requiring an understanding of the sound distributions of natural languages to form phonetic categories, parse words based on these categories, and then use these parses to map them to objects as labels.

The developmentally earliest understanding of word to referent associations have been reported at six months old, with infants comprehending the words ' [[mother|mommy]]' and '[[father|daddy]]' or their familial or cultural equivalents. Further studies have shown that infants quickly develop in this capacity and by seven months are capable of learning associations between moving images and [[nonsense]] words and syllables.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

It is important to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific [[type-token distinction|instance]] or individual and mapping a label to an entire [[type-token distinction|class]] of objects. This latter process is sometimes referred to as [[generalization]] or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input.&lt;ref name = "general"/&gt; These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of [[Organizing Knowledge Cognitively#Concepts|under]] and [[Organizing Knowledge Cognitively#Concepts|overgeneralization]] in infant [[vocabulary development|word learning]]. Research has also shown that the frequency in co-occurrence of referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vouloumanos|first=Athena|title=Fine-grained sensitivity to statistical information in adult word learning|journal=Cognition|date=May 2008|volume=107|issue=2|pages=729–742|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.007|pmid=17950721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to appropriately generalize to whole classes of yet unseen words, coupled with the abilities to parse continuous speech and keep track of word-ordering regularities, may be the critical skills necessary to develop proficiency with and knowledge of syntax and grammar.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

===Differences in autistic populations===
According to recent research, there is no neural evidence of statistical language learning in children with [[Autistic spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorders]]. When exposed to a continuous stream of artificial speech, neurotypical children displayed less cortical activity in the [[Frontal cortex|dorsolateral frontal cortices]] (specifically the [[middle frontal gyrus]]) as cues for word boundaries increased. However activity in these networks remained unchanged in autistic children, regardless of the verbal cues provided. This evidence, highlighting the importance of proper Frontal Lobe brain function is in support of the "Executive Functions" Theory, used to explain some of the biologically related causes of Autistic language deficits.  With impaired working memory, decision making, planning, and goal setting, which are vital functions of the Frontal Lobe, Autistic children are at loss when it comes to socializing and communication (Ozonoff, et al., 2004). Additionally, researchers have found that the level of communicative impairment in autistic children was inversely correlated with signal increases in these same regions during exposure to artificial languages. Based on this evidence, researchers have concluded that children with autism spectrum disorders don't have the neural architecture to identify word boundaries in continuous speech. Early word segmentation skills have been shown to predict later language development, which could explain why language delay is a hallmark feature of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott-Van Zeeland | first1 = A.

=== Statistical language learning across situations ===
Language learning takes place in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics in order to learn about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within a context. For example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn about the ways that the words are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.

Inductive learning problem can occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous situations in which there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as they may not be able to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that a way to make a distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.

==Computational models==
[[Computational model]]s have long been used to explore the mechanisms by which language learners process and manipulate linguistic [[information]]. Models of this type allow researchers to systematically control important learning variables that are oftentimes difficult to manipulate at all in human participants.&lt;ref name = "zins"&gt;Zinszer, B. &amp; Li, P. (2010). [https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt55v2387s/qt55v2387s.pdf A SOM model of first language lexical attrition]. In S. Ohlsson &amp; R. Catrambone (Eds.), Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2787-2792). Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative models===
[[artificial neural network|Associative neural network]] models of language acquisition are one of the oldest types of [[cognitive model]], using [[neural network|distributed representations]] and changes in the weights of the connections between the nodes that make up these representations to simulate learning in a manner reminiscent of the [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]-based [[neuron]]al reorganization that forms the basis of human learning and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidenberg | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Mcclelland | first2 = J. L. | year = 1989 | title = A Distributed, Developmental Model of Word Recognition and Naming | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 523–568 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.523 | pmid=2798649| citeseerx = 10.1.1.127.3083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Associative models represent a break with [[GOFAI|classical cognitive]] models, characterized by discrete and [[physical symbol system|context-free symbols]], in favor of a [[dynamical system]]s approach to language better capable of handling [[time|temporal]] considerations.&lt;ref name = "lexorg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = Lexical organization and competition in first and second languages: computational and neural mechanisms | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 629–64 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01028.x | pmid = 21585481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor to this approach, and one of the first model types to account for the dimension of time in linguistic comprehension and production was [[Jeffrey Elman|Elman]]'s [[Simple recurrent network#Elman networks and Jordan networks|simple recurrent network]] (SRN). By making use of a [[feedback]] network to represent the system's past states, SRNs were able in a word-prediction task to [[cluster analysis|cluster]] input into self-organized [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] based solely on statistical co-occurrence patterns.&lt;ref name = "lexorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "srn"&gt;Elman, J. L. (1975). Language as a dynamical system. Most.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early successes such as these paved the way for dynamical systems research into linguistic acquisition, answering many questions about early linguistic development but leaving many others unanswered, such as how these statistically acquired [[lexeme]]s are [[representation (psychology)|represented]].&lt;ref name = "lexorg"/&gt; Of particular importance in recent research has been the effort to understand the dynamic interaction of learning (e.g. language-based) and learner (e.g. speaker-based) variables in lexical organization and [[competition model|competition]] in [[multilingualism|bilinguals]].&lt;ref name = "zins"/&gt; In the ceaseless effort to move toward more psychologically realistic models, many researchers have turned to a subset of associative models, [[self-organizing map]]s (SOMs), as established, cognitively plausible models of language development.&lt;ref&gt;Kohonen, T. (n.d.). The Self-Organizing Map.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = X. | last2 = Li | first2 = P. | last3 = Kohonen | first3 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Contextual self-organizing map: software for constructing semantic representations | url = | journal = Behavior Research Methods | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 77–88 | doi = 10.3758/s13428-010-0042-z | pmid = 21287105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOMs have been helpful to researchers in identifying and investigating the constraints and variables of interest in a number of acquisition processes, and in exploring the consequences of these findings on linguistic and cognitive theories. By identifying [[working memory]] as an important constraint both for language learners and for current computational models, researchers have been able to show that manipulation of this variable allows for [[bootstrapping (linguistics)|syntactic bootstrapping]], drawing not just categorical but actual content meaning from words' positional co-occurrence in sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Li, P., Burgess, C., &amp; Lund, K. (2000). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.476&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The Acquisition of Word Meaning through Global Lexical Co-occurrences]. Young Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilistic models===
Some recent [[statistical model|models]] of language acquisition have centered around methods of [[Bayesian Inference]] to account for infants' abilities to appropriately parse streams of speech and acquire word meanings. Models of this type rely heavily on the notion of [[conditional probability]] (the probability of A given B), in line with findings concerning infants' use of transitional probabilities of words and syllables to learn words.&lt;ref name = "saffran"/&gt;

Models that make use of these probabilistic methods have been able to merge the previously [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] language acquisition perspectives of [[social interactionist theory|social theories]] that emphasize the importance of learning speaker intentions and statistical and [[relational frame theory|associative theories]] that rely on cross-situational contexts into a single joint-inference problem. This approach has led to important results in explaining acquisition phenomena such as [[mutual exclusivity (psychology)|mutual exclusivity]], one-trial learning or [[fast mapping]], and the use of [[intention|social intentions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, M. C., Goodman, N. D., &amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. (2009). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.1822&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Using Speakers ' Referential Intentions to Model Early Cross-Situational Word Learning]. Psychological Science, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these results seem to be robust, studies concerning these models' abilities to handle more complex situations such as multiple referent to single label mapping, multiple label to single referent mapping, and bilingual language acquisition in comparison to associative models' successes in these areas have yet to be explored. Hope remains, though, that these model types may be merged to provide a comprehensive account of language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffiths | first1 = T.

===C/V hypothesis===
Along the lines of probabilistic frequencies, the C/V hypothesis basically states all language hearers use consonantal frequencies to distinguish between words (lexical distinctions) in continuous speech strings, in comparison to vowels. Vowels are more pertinent to rhythmic identification. Several follow-up studies revealed this finding, as they showed that vowels are processed independently of their local statistical distribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sissa.it/cns/Books/Linguistic%20Contstraints_in%20Rebuschat%20&amp;%20Williams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Other research has shown that the consonant-vowel ratio doesn't influence the sizes of lexicons when comparing distinct languages.  In the case of languages with a higher consonant ratio, children may depend more on consonant neighbors than rhyme or vowel frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Lambertsen, Claus; Oetting, Janna; Barlow, Jessica. Journal of Speech, Language &amp; Hearing Research. Oct2012, Vol. 55 Issue 5, p1265-1273.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tafwid''' ({{lang-ar|تفويض}}) is an Arabic term meaning "relegation" or "delegation", with uses in theology and law.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== In theology ==

In Islamic theology, ''tafwid'' (or ''tafwid al-amr li-llah'', relegation of matters to God) is a doctrine according to which the meanings of the ambiguous verses of the [[Qur'an]] should be consigned to God alone.&lt;ref name=ODOI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA310|title=Tafwid|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Islam|editor=John L.

The doctrine of ''tafwid'', which was held by a number of classical scholars such as [[al-Ghazali]] and whose origin they attributed to the ''[[salaf]]'' (exemplary early Muslims), states that the Quranic expressions such as 'God's hands' or 'face' do not carry the literal meanings like their counterparts in human beings. Rather they are attributes or qualities of God and not organs like the face or hands of human beings.&lt;ref name="Phd338"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. Dissertation|last=Shah |first=Zulfikar|date=March 1997 |title=A Study of Anthropomorphism and Transcendence in the Bible and Qur'an.

On this matter, we follow the early Muslims ([[salaf]]): [[Malik]], [[Awza'i]], [[Thawri]], [[Al-Layth ibn Sa'd|Layth ibn Sa'd]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh]], and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, without saying how it is meant (min ghayr takyif), without likening it to created things (wa la tashbih), and without nullifying it (wa la ta'til): The literal meaning ([[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists (al-mushabbihin) is negated of Allah, for nothing from His creation resembles Him: '''"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"''' (Qur'an 42:11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htx8BAAAQBAJ|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of al-Bajuri|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|date=2014-09-09|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438453712|location=|pages=129–130|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail|publisher=Maktabat Awlad al-Shaykh l'il Turath|year=2000|location=Cairo|pages=6:320}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise nature of ''tafwid'' has been subject to debate among Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Lauziere&gt;{{Cite book|first=Henri |last=Lauzière | year=2015 | title=The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press (Kindle edition)|page=6048 (Kindle location)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Ibn Taymiyya]], including contemporary [[Salafi]]s, hold that only the modality of the attributes should be consigned to God (''tafwid al-kayfiyya''), while the literal sense of the attributes should be accepted according to their lexical meaning in the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; Thus they argue that the ''salaf'' accepted that God has a hand, because the meaning of the word "hand" (''yad'') was known, but without assuming that God's hand is comparable to a human hand, or asking how or why that is.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; In contrast, anti-Salafi scholars reject this distinction and accept ''tafwid'' without qualification.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt;

== Divorce==

In Islamic personal status law, ''tafwid'' refers to a sub-type of divorce (''talaq al-tafwid'' or ''tafwid al-talaq'') in which the power of ''[[Divorce in Islam|talaq]]'' (the type of divorce normally initiated by the husband) is delegated to the wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract or during the marriage, with or without conditions.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Classical jurists differed as to the validity of different forms of delegation.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Most modern Muslim-majority countries permit this type of divorce in some form.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== Other uses==

The term ''tafwid'' has also been used in law with various other meanings related to delegation of power, authorization of an act, or issuance of a warrant for arrest.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

'''Turbomachinery''', in [[mechanical engineering]], describes [[machine]]s that transfer [[energy]] between a [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] and a [[fluid]], including both [[turbines]] and [[gas compressor|compressors]].  While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.&lt;ref name="Logan1"&gt;Logan, Earl. "Handbook of turbomachinery". 1995. Marcel Deckker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamili1"&gt;Vandad Talimi (Original author unknown). "Mechanical Equipment and Systems". 2013. Memorial University of Newfoundland. http://www.engr.mun.ca/~yuri/Courses/MechanicalSystems/Turbomachinery.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These two types of machines are governed by the same basic relationships including [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's second Law of Motion]] and [[Euler's pump and turbine equation]] for [[compressible fluid]]s.  [[Centrifugal pump]]s are also turbomachines that transfer energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;

== History ==
The first use of turbomachines were technically water wheels between the 3rd and 1st century BCE, credited to the people in the Mediterranean region (see more at [[water wheel]]). The first real modern turbomachines did not appear until the late 1880s. It was not until the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], however, [[steam power]] started to be utilized with [[reciprocating engine]]s and turbines, which opened up the potential of steam power. The first impulse type turbine was created by Carl Gustaf de Laval in 1883. This was closely followed by the first practical reaction type turbine in 1884, built by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]]. Parsons’ first design was a multi-stage axial-flow unit, which [[George Westinghouse]] acquired and began manufacturing in 1895, while [[General Electric]] acquired de Laval’s designs in 1897. Since then, development has skyrocketed from Parsons’ early design, producing 0.746&amp;nbsp;kW, to modern nuclear steam turbines producing upwards of 1500 MW. Today, steam turbines account for roughly 90% of electrical power generated in the United States. The first patents for gas turbines were filed in 1791 by [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]]. Then the first functioning industrial gas turbines were used in the late 1890s to power street lights (Meher-Homji, 2000).

==Classification==
[[File:SteamTurbine.jpg|thumb|A steam turbine from [[MAN SE]] subdidiary MAN Turbo]]
In general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and closed turbomachines. Open machines such as [[propeller]]s, [[windmill]]s, and unshrouded [[mechanical fan|fan]]s act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas closed machines operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

Turbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the [[axis of rotation]], they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

Turbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those that absorb energy to increase the [[fluid pressure]], i.e. [[pump]]s, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], and [[Gas compressor|compressors]], and those that produce energy such as [[turbine]]s by expanding flow to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain pumps, fans, compressors and turbines. These components are essential in almost all mechanical equipment systems, such as power and [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycles]].&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bask1"&gt;Baskharone, E.

== Turbomachines ==

===Definition===
Any device that extracts energy from or imparts energy to a continuously moving stream of fluid can be called a turbomachine. Elaborating, a turbomachine is a power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a rotating element, the rotor; the action of the rotor changes the energy level of the continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans are all members of this family of machines.&lt;ref name="Raja1"&gt;Rajadurai, J. S. "Thermodynamics and thermal engineering". 2003. New Age International. {{ISBN|81-224-1493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to positive displacement machines (particularly of the reciprocating type which are low speed machines based on the mechanical and volumetric efficiency considerations), the majority of turbomachines run at comparatively higher speeds without any mechanical problems and volumetric efficiency close to one hundred percent.&lt;ref name="SOCO1"&gt;"Combining Support Vector Machines and Segmentation Algorithms for Efficient Anomaly Detection: A Petroleum Industry Application". International Joint Conference SOCO’14-CISIS’14-ICEUTE’14. 2014. pp.269-278. {{ISBN|978-3-319-07995-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization===

====Energy conversion====
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the direction of energy conversion:&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

* Absorb power to increase the fluid pressure or head (ducted Fans, compressors and pumps).
* Produce power by expanding fluid to a lower pressure or head (hydraulic, steam and gas turbines).

====Fluid flow====
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the nature of flow path through the passage of the rotor:&lt;ref name="Mobil1"&gt;Wills, J. George. "Lubrication fundamentals". 1980. Mobil oil corporation. Marcel Dekker. 460 pages. {{ISBN|0-8247-6976-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''[[Axial flow|Axial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or mainly parallel to the axis of rotation, the device is termed an axial flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1"&gt;Dixon, S. L. "Fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of turbomachinery". 1998. Elsevier. 460 pages. {{ISBN|0-7506-7870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radial component of the fluid velocity is negligible. Since there is no change in the direction of the fluid, several axial stages can be used to increase power output.

A [[Kaplan turbine]] is an example of an axial flow turbine.

In the figure:
*U = Blade velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = Flow velocity,
*V = Absolute velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = Relative velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = Tangential or Whirl component of velocity.
[[File:Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''[[Radial turbine|Radial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the throughflow is wholly or mainly in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the device is termed a radial flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt; Therefore, the change of radius between the entry and the exit is finite. A Radial turbomachine can be inward or outward flow type depending on the purpose that needs to be served. Outward flow type increases the energy level of the fluid and vice versa. Due to continuous change in direction, several radial stages are generally not used.

A [[centrifugal pump]] is an example of a radial flow turbomachine.

''[[Mixed flow compressor|Mixed flow turbomachines]]'' – When axial and radial flow are both present and neither is negligible, the device is termed a mixed flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt; It combines flow and force components of both radial and axial types.

A [[Francis turbine]] is an example of a mixed-flow turbine.

====Physical action====
Turbomachines can finally be classified on the relative magnitude of the pressure changes that take place across a stage:&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bask1" /&gt;

[[File:An Impulse Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|An Impulse Turbomachine Stage&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''Impulse Turbomachines'' operate by accelerating and changing the flow direction of fluid through a stationary [[nozzle]] (the stator blade) onto the rotor blade. The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the [[enthalpy]] of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt;

[[Newton's second law]] describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.

A [[Pelton wheel]] is an impulse design.

[[File:A Reaction Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|A Reaction Turbomachine Stage&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''Reaction Turbomachines'' operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;

[[Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.

Most turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.

==Dimensionless ratios to describe turbomachinery==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|[[Pelton wheel]] being installed into [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]].]]
The following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines.  They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.
#Pressure range '''ψ'''
#Flow coefficient '''φ''' (including delivery or volume number called)
#Performance numbers '''λ'''
#Run number '''σ'''
#Diameter Number '''δ'''

== Applications ==

=== Power Generation ===
[[Hydroelectricity|'''Hydro electric''']]- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates electricity

[[Steam turbine|'''Steam turbines''']]- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.

[[Gas turbine|'''Gas turbines''']]- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.

[[Wind turbine|'''Windmills''']]- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a steam turbine, but work with an infinite supply of wind.

=== Marine ===
'''Steam turbine'''- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they don’t need to power a whole town. They aren’t very common because of their high initial cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with it.

'''Gas turbines'''- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels. They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013), and are much smaller for a given amount of power.
Flow of air through a turbocharger and engine

'''[[Pump-jet|Water jet]]-''' Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castoldijet.it/en/waterjet_en/waterjet_drive_propulsion_systems.html|title=Waterjet drives propulsion systems|website=www.castoldijet.it|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water jets are best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonjet.com/global/waterjet-overview|title=WaterJet Overview|date=2015-03-18|work=HamiltonJet|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auto ===
[[File:Turbocharger Animation by Tyroola.gif|thumb|Air and exhaust flow through engine and turbocharger]]
[[Turbocharger|'''Turbochargers''']]- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel, much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and compressing outside air into the engine.

[[Supercharger|'''Superchargers''']]- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from the engine to spin a screw or vein, some way to suck in and compress the air into the engine.

=== General ===
[[Pump|'''Pumps''']]- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis to turbomachinery (Škorpík, 2017).

[[Air compressor|'''Air compressors''']]- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.

'''[[Mechanical fan|Fans]]'''- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this way.

=== Aerospace ===
'''Gas turbines'''- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial turbines, and are most often the most advanced.

==Partial list of turbomachine topics==
Many types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist.  Below is a partial list of these types.  What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all.  Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases.  This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.

The '''World Checklist of Selected Plant Families''' (usually abbreviated to '''WCSP''') is an "international collaborative programme that provides the latest peer reviewed and published opinions on the accepted [[Botanical nomenclature|scientific names]] and [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|synonyms]] of selected plant families."&lt;ref name=WCSP_home/&gt; Maintained by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], it is available online, allowing searches for the names of families, genera and species, as well as the ability to create checklists. 

The project traces its history to work done in the 1990s by Kew researcher [[Rafaël Govaerts]] on a checklist of the genus ''[[Quercus]]''. Influenced by the [[Global Strategy for Plant Conservation]], the project expanded. {{Asof|2013|January}}, 173 families of [[seed plant]]s were included.&lt;ref name=WCSP_home/&gt; Coverage of [[monocotyledon]] families is complete; other families are being added.&lt;ref name=WCSP_about/&gt;

There is a complementary project called the [[International Plant Names Index]] (IPNI), in which Kew is also involved. The IPNI aims to provide details of publication and does not aim to determine which are accepted species names. After a delay of about a year, newly published names are automatically added from the IPNI to the WCSP.&lt;ref name=WCSP_about/&gt; The WCSP is also one of the underlying databases for [[The Plant List]], created by Kew and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], which was unveiled in 2010.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/plant-database-library-101229.html | title=World's Largest Plants Database Assembled | date=2010 | publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''étude''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|tj|uː|d}}; {{IPA-fr|eˈtyd|lang}}, meaning 'study') is an instrumental [[musical composition]], usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill. The tradition of writing études emerged in the early 19th century with the rapidly growing popularity of the [[piano]]. Of the vast number of études from that era some are still used as teaching material (particularly pieces by [[Carl Czerny]] and [[Muzio Clementi]]), and a few, by major composers such as [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Claude Debussy]], achieved a place in today's concert repertory. Études written in the 20th century include those related to traditional ones ([[György Ligeti]]) and those that require wholly unorthodox technique ([[John Cage]]).

==19th century==
Studies, lessons, and other didactic instrumental pieces composed before the 19th century are extremely varied, without any established genres. [[Domenico Scarlatti]]'s ''30 Essercizi per gravicembalo'' ("30 Exercises for harpsichord", 1738) do not differ in scope from his other keyboard works, and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s four volumes of ''[[List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime|Clavier-Übung]]'' ("keyboard practice") contain everything from simple organ duets to the extensive and difficult ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''.

The situation changed in the early 19th century. Instruction books with exercises became very common. Of particular importance were collections of "studies" by [[Johann Baptist Cramer]] (published between 1804 and 1810), early parts of [[Muzio Clementi]]'s ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' (1817&amp;ndash;26), numerous works by [[Carl Czerny]], [[Maria Szymanowska]]'s ''Vingt exercises et préludes'' (c.&amp;thinsp;1820), and [[Ignaz Moscheles]]' ''Studien'' Op. 70 (1825&amp;ndash;26). However, with the late parts of Clementi's collection and Moscheles' ''Charakteristische Studien'' Op. 95 (1836&amp;ndash;37) the situation began to change, with both composers striving to create music that would both please the audiences in concert and serve as a good teaching tool. Such a combination of didactic and musical value in a study is sometimes referred to as a concert study.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:FuseesLiszt.JPG|left|320px|thumb|Last bars of Franz Liszt's [[Transcendental Étude No. 2 (Liszt)|Transcendental Étude No. 2]]: one of the most difficult of Liszt's études, this is a study in passages for alternating and overlapping hands.]]
The technique required to play [[Études (Chopin)|Chopin's ''Études'']], Op. 10 (1833) and Op. 25 (1837) was extremely novel at the time of their publication; the first performer who succeeded at mastering the pieces was the renowned virtuoso composer [[Franz Liszt]] (to whom Chopin dedicated the Op. 10). Liszt himself composed a number of études that were more extensive and even more complex than Chopin's. Among these, the most well-known is the collection ''[[Transcendental Etudes|Études d'Execution Transcendante]]'' (final version published in 1852). These did not retain the didactic aspect of Chopin's work, however, since the difficulty and the technique used varies within a given piece. Each of the études has a different character, designated by its name: Preludio; Molto Vivace; Paysage / Landscape; Mazeppa; Feux Follets - Irrlichter/ Will-o'-the-wisp ; Vision; Eroica; Wilde Jagd/ Wild Hunt; Ricordanza; Allegro Molto Agitato; Harmonies du Soir/ Evening Harmonies; and Chasse-neige / Snow-whirls.

The 19th century also saw a number of étude and study collections for instruments other than the piano. Guitarist composer [[Fernando Sor]] published his 12 Studies, op. 6 for guitar in London as early as 1815. These works all conform to the standard definition of 19th-century étude in that they are short compositions, each exploiting a single facet of technique. Collections of studies for flute were published during the second half of the 19th century by [[Ernesto Köhler]], Wilhelm Popp and Adolf Terschak.

==20th century==
[[File:Cage-etudes-australes-8.gif|thumb|330px|right|The beginning of John Cage's Étude 8, Book I of ''[[Etudes Australes|Études Australes]]''. These études, while not didactic, are still very challenging to play, and are based on an unorthodox playing technique. The top two staves are for the right hand, the lower two are for the left hand.]]
The early 20th century saw the publication of a number of important collections of études. [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Études (Debussy)|Études]]'' for piano (1915) conform to the "one facet of technique per piece" rule, but exhibit unorthodox structures with many sharp contrasts, and many concentrate on sonorities and timbres peculiar to the piano, rather than technical points. [[Leopold Godowsky]]'s ''[[Studies on Chopin's Études|53 Studies on the Chopin Études]]'' (1894&amp;ndash;1914) are built on Chopin's études: Godowsky's additions and changes elevated Chopin's music to new, hitherto unknown levels of difficulty. Other important études of this period include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]' virtuoso ''12 Études'' for guitar (1929) and pieces by Russian composers: [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Études-Tableaux (disambiguation)|Études-Tableaux]]'' (1911, 1917) and several collections by [[Alexander Scriabin]] (all for piano).

By mid-century the old étude tradition was largely abandoned. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''[[Quatre études de rythme]]'' ("Four studies in rhythm", 1949&amp;ndash;50) were not didactic compositions, but experiments with scales of [[note value|durations]], as well as with [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Figure (music)|figurations]], [[Timbre|coloration]], and pitches. [[John Cage]]'s études&amp;mdash;''[[Etudes Australes|Études Australes]]'' (1974&amp;ndash;75) for piano, ''[[Etudes Boreales|Études Boreales]]'' (1978) for cello and/or piano and ''[[Freeman Etudes|Freeman Études]]'' (1977&amp;ndash;80, 1989&amp;ndash;90) for violin&amp;mdash;are [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminate]] pieces based on [[star chart]]s, and some of the most difficult works in the repertory. The three books of [[Études (Ligeti)|Études]] by [[György Ligeti]] (1985, 1988&amp;ndash;94, 1995) are perhaps closest to the old tradition in that they too concentrate each on a particular technique. [[Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji]]'s ''[[Transcendental Studies (Sorabji)|Études transcendantes (100)]]'' (1940&amp;ndash;44), which take Godowsky and Liszt as their starting point, frequently focus on particular technical elements, as well as various rhythmical difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sorabji-archive.co.uk/etudes/etudes-list.php|title=100 Transcendental Etudes (1940–44)|author=Fredrik Ullén|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Sorabji Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/05-etude.htm|title=Notes on the Études transcendantes|author=Marc-André Roberge|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Sorabji Resource Site|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bolcom]] was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his ''[[Twelve New Etudes for Piano]]'' in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
