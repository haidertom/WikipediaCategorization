{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ab urbe condita''}}
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoninianus]] of [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] in 248. It bears the legend ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]]
'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː}}), or '''''Anno urbis conditæ''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈannoː ˈʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯}}), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]].  ''Ab urbe condita'' literally means "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]," while ''anno urbis conditæ'' means "in the year since the City's founding."  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|sæculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

==Calendar era==
{{see|Calendar era}}
The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. 
Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the 
[[Diocletian era]].
This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.&lt;ref&gt;
J. David Thomas, "On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars", 
''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&amp;ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …").&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&amp;ndash;780.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. 
Thus, 
* AUC 1 = 753 BC
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}

[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]'s '''''Apologia ad Guillelmum''''' was written in 1125 at the ostensible request of his friend and fellow monastic reformer, [[William of St-Thierry|William of Saint-Thierry]], and is the key document in the early twelfth century controversy over art, the greatest controversy over art to occur in the West previous to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Things-Greater-Importance-Clairvauxs-Apologia/dp/0812281810|title=The "Things of Greater Importance": Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia and the Medieval Attitude Toward Art|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1990-07-01|publisher=Univ of Pennsylvania Pr|isbn=9780812281811|edition=First|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian period]], there was disagreement within the Church as to the appropriateness of [[Catholic Church art|religious art]].  While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages.  In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the [[Cistercians]] but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons.  Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious).  Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society—and since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism—the controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions.

The ''Apologia'' is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived.  In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.

== Art to attract donations ==

=== The monastic investment ===
Perhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art.

=== The liturgical artwork ===
[[File:Master Of Saint Gilles - The Mass of St Gilles - WGA14485.jpg|thumb|''The Mass of Saint Giles'', by the [[Master of Saint Giles]], c. 1500 (National Gallery, London)]]
In discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity.  In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics.

=== The equation between excessive art and holiness ===
In his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of ''praesentia'' (the physical presence of the holy).

=== Art in opposition to the care of the poor ===
Following in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking.

=== Art as a spiritual distraction to the monk ===
One of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk.  Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality.

=== To Whom the Apologia Was Addressed ===
While the traditional view has been that the ''Apologia'' was directed at the art of the monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the ''Apologia'' was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders ([[Carthusians]], [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], [[Premonstratensians]], and so on), and Bernard's own [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1988-01-01|title=Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia as a Description of Cluny, and the Controversy over Monastic Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/767000|journal=Gesta|volume=27|issue=1/2|pages=125–132|doi=10.2307/767000|issn=0016-920X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock 1 of Bedolina, the so-called '''Bedolina Map''', is a famous engraved prehistoric rock which is part of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Camonica valley]] (Alps, Italian side, [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]]) petroglyph complex. It is known as being one of the most ancient topographic maps,&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Llorís M., 1972. ''Los grabados rupestres de Bedolina (Valcamonica)'', [http://www.ccsp.it/web/INFOCCSP/bcsp/bcsp08.html BCSP, vol. VIII], Capo di Ponte (BS): 121-158&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as the depiction of cultivated plots, mountain paths and villages. The locality of Bedolina pertains to the [[Capo di Ponte]] municipality (BS-I), near the hamlet of Pescarzo.  The area is included in the [http://www.parcoseradinabedolina.it/ Seradina-Bedolina Archaeologic park], lying on a prominent terrace on the right slope  of  the Camonica valley, at an altitude of 530 m above the sea level. The rock, a flat surface of Permian sandstone (Verrucano of Lombardy) polished by the Pleistocene glacier, is 9&amp;nbsp;m long and 4&amp;nbsp;m wide.

A total number of 109 figures&lt;ref&gt;Turconi C., 1998. ''La mappa di Bedolina nel quadro dell'arte rupestre della Valcamonica'', Notizie Archeologiche Bergomensi, vol. 5: 85-113.&lt;/ref&gt; were carved during the late Bronze Age and the Iron Age (1000-200 BC), mainly the so-called topographic patterns&lt;ref&gt;Arcà Andrea, 2007. ''Le raffigurazioni topografiche, colture e culture preistoriche nella prima fase dell’arte rupestre di Paspardo''.In: FOSSATI A.E. (ed.), ''La Castagna della Vallecamonica. Paspardo, arte rupestre e castanicoltura, Atti del Convegno interdisciplinare, Paspardo 6-7-8 ottobre 2006'', Paspardo: pp. 35-56. Available as a ''TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin'' open access paper, full text-image inline PDF,  online http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/?p=4027&lt;/ref&gt; (dotted squares and zigzagging "paths"), warriors, animals, wooden huts, cup-marks and a [[Camunian rose|Camunnian Rose]].  The rock has been completely recorded and studied by Miguel Beltrán Llorís (Beltrán Llorís 1972) and more recently by Cristina Turconi, for the Milan University.&lt;ref&gt;Turconi C., 2001. ''La mappa di Bedolina: il suo significato nel quadro dell'arte rupestre camuna dell'età del Ferro'', in ''Archeologia e arte rupestre. L'Europa, le Alpi, la Valcamonica. Atti del Convegno di studi, 2-5- ottobre 1997'': Milano: 239-243.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the most recent studies and to the close examination of figures and superimpositions, the best known engraved patterns of the Bedolina Map, precisely "maps", likely pertain to the Iron Age, and more in detail to the central centuries of the 1st millennium BC (6th-4th centuries BC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Bioresource engineering''' is similar to [[biological engineering]], except that it is based on biological and/or agricultural feedstocks. Bioresource engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as [[biomass]], biological waste treatment, bioenergy, [[biotransformations]], bioresource systems analysis, [[bioremediation]] and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies such as combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc.

Bioresource engineering also contains biochemical conversion technologies such as aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, and composting.  Products include fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products, and management products e.g. modelling, systems analysis, decisions, and support systems. 
Bioresource engineering is a discipline that is usually very similar to environmental engineering.

The impact of [[urbanization]] and increasing demand for food, water and land presents bioresource engineers with the task of bridging the gap between the biological world and traditional engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smithers |first=JC |title=WHAT IS BIORESOURCES ENGINEERING?"

In [[education]], '''computational thinking''' is a set of [[problem-solving]] methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a [[computer]] could execute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Computational Thinking Benefits Society| journal = 40th Anniversary Blog of Social Issues in Computing |  year = 2014| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeannette| url = http://socialissues.cs.toronto.edu/index.html%3Fp=279.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The history of computational thinking dates back at least to the 1950s but most ideas are much older.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"&gt;{{Cite book | title =Proceedings  of the 16th Koli Calling Conference on Computing Education Research| chapter = The Long Quest for Computational Thinking| year = 2016| last1 = Tedre | first1 = Matti| last2 = Denning | first2 = Peter J.| url = http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/long-quest-ct.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''computational thinking'' was first used by [[Seymour Papert]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Papert, Seymour. Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas. Basic Books, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00191473| title = An exploration in the space of mathematics educations| journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning| volume = 1| year = 1996| last1 = Papert | first1 = Seymour| authorlink1 = Seymour Papert| url = http://www.papert.org/articles/AnExplorationintheSpaceofMathematicsEducations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking can be used to [[algorithm]]ically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Computational thinking:

The phrase ''computational thinking'' was brought to the forefront of the [[computer science]] community as a result of an [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Communications essay on the subject by [[Jeannette Wing]]. The essay suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1118178.1118215| title = Computational thinking| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 33| year = 2006| url = https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeanette M. | authorlink = Jeannette Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

The characteristics that define computational thinking are [[decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]], [[pattern recognition]] / [[data representation]], [[generalization]]/[[abstraction]], and [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to computational thinking|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zp92mp3/|website=BBC Bitesize|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Computational Thinking|url=https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/exploring-computational-thinking/|website=Google for Education|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By decomposing a problem, identifying the variables involved using data representation, and creating algorithms, a generic solution results. The generic solution is a generalization or abstraction that can be used to solve a multitude of variations of the initial problem.

[[File:The Computational Thinking Process.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The "three As" Computational Thinking Process describes computational thinking as a set of three steps: abstraction, automation, and analysis.]]

Another characterization of computational thinking is the "three As" iterative process based on three stages:
# '''Abstraction''': Problem formulation;
# '''Automation''': Solution expression;
# '''Analyses''': Solution execution and evaluation.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Connection to the "four Cs" ===

The [[four Cs of 21st century learning]] are communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. The fifth C could be computational thinking which entails the capability to resolve problems algorithmically and logically. It includes tools that produce models and visualize data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.educationdive.com/news/should-the-4-cs-of-21st-century-skills-make-room-for-one-more/517878/|title=Should the 4 Cs of 21st century skills make room for one more?|work=Education Dive|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking is applicable across subjects beyond science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which include the social sciences and language arts. Students can engage in activities where they identify patterns in grammar as well as sentence structure and use models for studying relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|title=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|website=EducationWorld.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the 4 Cs have gradually gained acceptance as vital elements of many school syllabi. This development triggered a modification in platforms and directions such as inquiry, project-based, and more profound learning across all K-12 levels. Many countries have introduced computer thinking to all students. The United Kingdom has CT in its national curriculum since 2012. Singapore calls CT as “national capability”. Other nations like Australia, China, Korea, and New Zealand embarked on massive efforts to introduce computational thinking in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-02-25-the-5th-c-of-21st-century-skills-try-computational-thinking-not-coding|title=The 5th ‘C’ of 21st Century Skills?

CT refers to thought processes required in understanding problems and formulating solutions. CT involves logic, assessment, patterns, automation, and generalization.

== In K-12 education ==

Jeannette Wing envisioned computational thinking becoming an essential part of every child's education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, since her article (published in 2006) integrating computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum has faced several challenges including the agreement on the definition of computational thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Valerie|last2=Stephenson|first2=Chris|year=2011|title=Bringing computational thinking to K-12: what is Involved and what is the role of the computer science education community?|journal=Acm Inroads|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grover|first=Shuchi|last2=Pea|first2=Roy|year=2013|title=Computational Thinking in K–12 A Review of the State of the Field|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=42|doi=10.3102/0013189x12463051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, computational thinking is broadly defined as a set of cognitive skills and problem solving processes that include (but are not limited to) the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Chris|date=May 2011|title=Defining Computational Thinking for K-12|journal=CSTA Voice|volume=7|issue=2|pages=3–4|issn=1555-2128|quote=CT is a problem solving process...|author2=Valerie Barr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using abstractions and pattern recognition to represent the problem in new and different ways
* Logically organizing and analyzing data
* Breaking the problem down into smaller parts 
* Approaching the problem using programmatic thinking techniques such as iteration, symbolic representation, and logical operations
* Reformulating the problem into a series of ordered steps (algorithmic thinking)
* Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most efficient and effective combination of steps and resources
* Generalizing this problem-solving process to a wide variety of problems

Current integration computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum comes in two forms: in computer science classes directly or through the use and measure of computational thinking techniques in other subjects. Teachers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) focused classrooms that include computational thinking, allow students to practice [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] skills such as [[trial and error]] (Barr, et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=David|last2=Harrison|first2=John|last3=Leslie|first3=Conery|title=Computational Thinking: A Digital Age Skill for Everyone|journal=Learning &amp; Leading with Technology|date=2011-03-01|volume=38|issue=6|pages=20–23|issn=0278-9175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerie Barr]] and Chris Stephenson describe computational thinking patterns across disciplines in a 2011 [http://inroads.acm.org ACM Inroads] article&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However [[Conrad Wolfram]] has argued that computational thinking should be taught as a distinct subject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/computational-thinking-code-success Computational thinking is the code to success] Conrad Wolfram, The Times Educational Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Computational Thinking ==

[[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has a Center for Computational Thinking. The Center's major activity is conducting PROBEs or '''PROB'''lem-oriented '''E'''xplorations. These PROBEs are experiments that apply novel computing concepts to problems to show the value of computational thinking. A PROBE experiment is generally a collaboration between a computer scientist and an expert in the field to be studied. The experiment typically runs for a year. In general, a PROBE will seek to find a solution for a broadly applicable problem and avoid narrowly focused issues. Some examples of PROBE experiments are optimal kidney transplant logistics and how to create drugs that do not breed drug-resistant viruses.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/probes.html PROBE Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational thinking resources ==

There are a handful of on-line institutions which provide curriculum, and other related resources to build and strengthen pre-college students with computational thinking, analysis and problem-solving. One prominent one is the [http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy]. It offers training sessions for both pre-college students, as well as teachers. CMU's programs exercise [[instructional scaffolding]] methods via [[engineering process]]. There is also another online site named [http://www.legoengineering.com legoengineering.com].&lt;ref name="LEGO Engineering"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legoengineering.com|title=LEGO Engineering|accessdate=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering similar resources.

As far as a physical facility, in Central New Jersey, there is a small institution, named [[Storming Robots]], offering technology programs to Grade 4 to 12 with an emphasis on algorithmic and computational thinking via robotics projects throughout the school year. Students may follow its road map&lt;ref name="Storming Robots"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/roboclub.html#descRoadmap|title=Roadmap for learning path|accessdate=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from Grade 4 until they graduate to college.

Designed to increase the use of computational thinking, [http://www.computationalthinking.org computationalthinking.org]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computationalthinking.org|title=Computational Thinking|accessdate=2 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched to provide problem-solving resources to various sectors in an effort to increase the use of computational thinking. The resources include ready-made courses and materials for professionals, colleges, schools, and students. The services also include advising policymakers and governments on education reform and curriculum development.

== Criticism ==

The concept of computational thinking has been criticized as too vague, as it's rarely made clear how it is different from other forms of thought.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.csteachers.org/resource/resmgr/JonesCTOnePager.pdf|title=The Trouble with Computational Thinking|date=|website=|publisher=ACM|last1=Jones|first1=Elizabeth|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some computer scientists worry about the promotion of computational thinking as a substitute for a broader computer science education, as computational thinking represents just one small part of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denning|first1=Peter J.|title=Beyond computational thinking|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 June 2009|volume=52|issue=6|pages=28|doi=10.1145/1516046.1516054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others worry that the emphasis on Computational Thinking encourages computer scientists to think too narrowly about the problems they can solve, thus avoiding the social, ethical and environmental implications of the technology they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=Steve|title=From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking: A conceptual toolkit for sustainability computing|journal=Proceedings of the 2nd international conference ICT for Sustainability|date=2014|doi=10.2991/ict4s-14.2014.28|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/pub.php?publication=ict4s-14&amp;frame=http%3A//www.atlantis-press.com/php/paper-details.php%3Fid%3D13446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17297">'''Conservation development''', also known as '''conservation design''', is a controlled-growth [[land use]] development that adopts the principle for allowing limited [[sustainable development]] while protecting the area's natural environmental features in perpetuity, including preserving [[Open space reserve|open space]] landscape and vista, protecting [[Arable land|farmland]] or natural [[habitat]]s for wildlife, and maintaining the character of rural communities.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide To Creating Open Space Networks |last=Arendt |first=Randall G. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington |isbn=978-1-55963-489-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conservation development is usually defined as a project that dedicates a minimum of 50 percent of the total development parcel as [[Open space reserve|open space]]. The management and ownership of the land are often formed by the partnership between private land owners, land-use conservation organizations and [[local government]]. It is a growing trend in many parts of the country, particularly in the [[Western United States]]. In the [[Eastern United States]], conservation design has been promoted by some [[State governments of the United States|state]] and local governments as a technique to help preserve [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Dover, DE; and Brandywine Conservancy, Chadds Ford, PA.

This type of planning is becoming increasingly more relevant as "[[land conversion]] for [[housing development]] is a leading cause of [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]".&lt;ref name="Pejchar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pejchar|first=Liba|author2=Margaret R.

Conservation Development differs from other land protection approaches by aiming to protect land and environmental resources on parcels slated for immediate development—to protect land here and now. In contrast, a [[green belt]] approach typically aims to protect land from future development, and in a region beyond areas currently slated for development. It seeks to offer a gradient between urban regions and open countryside, beyond what a line on a map—typically a highway—currently provides. This approach seeks to avoid the dichotomy of economic urbanism on one side of such a street while on the other lies completely protected woodlands and farm fields, devoid of inclusion in that economy. Addressing the theoretical illusion that humanity walled off is better-off, Conservation Development recognizes that design of how we live is far more important than we allot credit; that instead of walling off a problem we need to face that problem and drastically lower our impact on the sites where we live, and indeed raise the performance of our communities toward a level where such walls are no longer considered first response requirements.

== History ==
Conservation development was formulated in the early 1980s by a British-trained planner Randall Arendt. He pulled together several concepts from the 1960s. He combined the idea of cluster and open space design with Ian McHarg's "design with nature" philosophy.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doyle |first=Donna L. |title=Planning for Greener Development: Conservation Development and Landon Bay East |journal=FES Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Series |year=2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation development ==
Conservation development seeks to protect a variety of ecological resources and services such as biodiversity, productive farmland, [[ecosystem services]], scenic landscapes and historic and cultural resources.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This is achieved by identifying the ecologically sensitive and valuable areas. The protected lands can be under an easement to prevent development on it. Housing is then built around the protected areas. Density, lots sizes, types of housing and amount of protected area is dependent on the type of conservation development.

While not a prevalent type of development, it's estimated that conservation development takes up between 2.5%-10% of the total US real estate development.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Conservation development is usually applied to rural, exurban or suburban residential subdivisions, though it does have a few urban applications (Doyle 4). 

While there are several types of conservation developments, they all have several features in common.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; All developments have conservation land set aside, either held by a conservation organization or protected by a conservation easement. These developments must have ongoing stewardship for the protected portion of the parcel.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; Secondly, the development finances the projected area. Third, each development begins by surveying the land's ecological features and resources. A decision can then be made about where to build and what areas need to be protected. Lastly, these developments also use a variety of design features to reduce some of the negative impacts inherent in development. Examples include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact stormwater management systems]], and landscape design.

== Types ==
Milder cites four principal conservation development techniques found in the United States.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The first two he groups together as having a "conservation with development" philosophy. Conservation is the main goal with development as a means to that end. The latter two types fall under the "development with conservation" ethos. These two types of projects are done through private developers whose goal is turn a profit at the end of the day, but in a "conservation-friendly matter".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Table 1 provides an excellent summary of the different conservation development techniques.

=== Conservation buyer projects ===
The first type he calls conservation buyer projects. In this situation, a land trust buys the property and places the ecologically important areas under a conservation easement. They then resell the land, including the easement, to a conservation buyer. The buyer cannot build on the easement, but may do so on the remaining, unprotected portion. This technique usually results in a few houses being built on the piece of land, resulting in a low density.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; According to a study undertaken by Milder &amp; Clark, 98.4% of the total land receives protection, the highest amongst the four conservation development types.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milder|first=Jeffery C.|author2=Story Clark|title=Conservation Development Practices, Extent and Land-Use Effects in the United States|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2001|volume=25|issue=4|pages=697–707|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01688.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation and limited development projects ===
The second type identified by Milder is called conservation and limited development projects (CLDP). They are often carried out by land trusts, and occasionally by conservation-minded developers or landowners. Real estate is developed for sale on an open market, and the profit is used to finance conservation of the nearly land. Milder &amp; Clark found that 93.5% of the total land area is protected under this type of development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt; Recent studies done on the effectiveness of CLDPs in protecting, restoring and managing threatened resources reveal that it is significantly more effective at doing so, in comparison to conservation subdivisions and conventional development.

=== Conservation subdivisions ===
Conservation subdivisions are the third and best-known type of conservation development. This is a development that "sets aside a major portion of the site as conservation land" and clusters housing on the remaining portion.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The houses are built on lots smaller than usual, meaning the density of the development nears the maximum allowed by zoning. Unlike conservation and limited development projects, a homeowners' association manages the protected land. These associations may lack knowledge and have different goals regarding the lands' management, which may result in a less than ideally managed conservation. As a result of this and other factors, a study found that on average only 57.1% of the total land area is protected from development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

=== Conservation-oriented planned development projects ===
The final type identified by Milder is called conservation-oriented planned development projects. These are large-scale development projects found in suburban and exurban areas. The scale of the projects means large tracts of land can be protected. They typically have densities nearing the zoned maximum and feature of a mix of housing types and land uses. The resulting percentage of protected land is 71.3.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

== Advantages ==
The biggest advantage of conservation development is that it can protect species and ecosystems, preventing further habitat fragmentation and loss. By surveying the land and identifying the primary conservation areas where ecosystems are most at risk, communities are created without huge disruption to the environment.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; Conservation development also provides for secondary conservation areas, which provide corridors for animals to hunt, mate and travel through.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

However, any development will have some impact on the land. But by studying it, there are ways in which this can be mitigated. A developer can have native vegetation planted. Wildlife friendly native species could be introduced,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; while invasive species are monitored and controlled.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|Stormwater management]] systems are also used to "promote natural flow patterns and infiltration", considered a very important factor in minimizing a development's impact.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt;

There are several benefits from an economic standpoint. Conservation development allows developers to make themselves distinct in a competitive housing market.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; A developer can use an environmentally oriented marketing strategy, highlighting the benefits of the development to possible buyer with a green thumb.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A final advantage of conservation development is that homes in these developments tend appreciate faster than their conventional counterparts.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

Pejchar et al. and Arendt cite a number of economic benefits that accrue to municipalities through conservation development. They include fewer public costs on maintenance and infrastructure, protecting open space without losing tax revenues, and avoiding the loss of ecological services like landscape stabilization, flood control and clean water.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A municipality also experiences a reduced demand for public green space since it has been provided free of charge by the development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

Lastly, there are a few social and recreational advantages to conservation development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; With the smaller lots that accompany these houses, homeowners are likely to move into public green space and engage with their neighbours. Community events such as picnics or parties are more common. The protected green space also provides excellent recreational activities, such as hiking, jogging, or simply observing nature. It's hopeful that with this experience, people can reconnect with nature and develop a land ethic.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
There are several drawbacks to conservation development. The first problem encountered is the perceived risk by both developers and homebuyers.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; In protecting sensitive areas, developers and homeowners see a risk in the possible elimination of desired sites to build homes. This might be a large enough risk to discourage developers. This could be a place for government intervention, which could provide tax breaks to developers building a development this way.

Conservation subdivisions and conservation-oriented planned development projects have been "criticized for protecting land at too small a scale to provide meaningful conservation benefits, while simultaneously promoting "leapfrog" development".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This pushes sprawl further from the city and contributes to a more fragmented rural area.

== Implications ==
This type of planning is becoming increasingly more relevant as "land conversion for housing development is a leading cause of habitat loss and fragmentation".&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; With a loss or fragmentation of a species' habitat, it results in the endangerment of a species and pushes them towards premature extinction.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Without biodiversity, we lose the many benefits we derive from it, including economic and ecological services, genetic information, and recreational pleasure, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Land conversion also contributes to the reduction of agriculturally productive land,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; already shrinking due to climate change.

'''Crow Canyon Archaeological Center'''  is a {{convert|170|acre|adj=on}} research center and "living classroom" located in southwestern [[Colorado]], USA, which offers experiential education programs for students and adults.

Crow Canyon is a center for archaeological research, education, and preservation of the history of the [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]], who lived on and in the cliff dwellings of [[Mesa Verde]] more than seven centuries ago. Established by private cultural initiatives that continue the work of American benefactors, the center provides hands-on programs for people to experience archaeological excavation of Native American sites.

== Brief history ==

Crow Canyon is the result of work in experiential and hands-on education started in 1967 by Edward F. Berger, a history teacher with the Cherry Creek Schools near Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Edward|title=Crow Canyon: Pioneering Education and Archaeology on the Southwestern Colorado Frontier|date=1st Edition 1993; 2nd Edition 2009|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington Indiana|isbn=978-1-4389-6009-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger brought students to SW Colorado  and involved them in building community and programs that increased motivation and accelerated learning.  Because of the rich prehistoric cultural base in the area, archaeology was added to the curricula and Berger, with the help of Dr. Art Rohn (then of Wichita State University) supported Rohn’s graduate students to teach and supervise high school students doing original research excavating ancient pueblo sites.  The development of this arrangement with academic scholars and the involvement and teaching of high school age students is believed to be first of its kind.

In 1972, Berger began working through the University of Northern Colorado on a doctoral program designed to create and field test experiential, motivational, and accelerated learning programs. These programs were interdisciplinary, supplemental high school credit courses . In 1972, Berger wrote the non-profit corporation Crow Canyon operates under today. Then it was called I-S Education Programs. 
In 1974, Berger purchased 80 acres of land west of Cortez, Colorado on Crow Canyon and began designing a year round campus . He earned his Ed.D. in 1975. His research into learning continued and from 1975 until 1986, Berger, now joined by his wife Joanne, pioneered new and effective learning and teaching techniques. The challenge was taking a student from zero knowledge about SW history and archaeology to working alongside of an academic scholar – and being effective – in two days. The accelerated learning techniques he developed made this possible.

The original campus facilities were basic, but “better than tents.” Educational programs were expanded to age groups 10 – 80 years of age. Dr. Ron Gould was the first staff archaeologist and teacher. Significant involvement with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe resulted in special Native American programs on campus and deep and lasting relationships with Ute Neighbors. Survey work in the areas west of the campus resulted in the identification and naming of sites (Smithsonian Numbers). Many bear the names of the schools across the US whose students identified them.

By the early 80s, Crow Canyon was well known for its educational programs and its archaeological research. The Bergers needed capital to improve the campus and to free them of 24/7/365 responsibility. They learned of the Foundation for Illinois Archaeology and its fledgling program at Kampsville, Illinois. A young and dynamic man, Clark Hinsdale, was building an educational component. Bergers contacted professor Struever at Northwestern University who headed the FIA. Struever was a successful fundraiser and promoter. By 1983, negations resulted in a merger of the two non-profit corporations note that Non-profit corporations are not bought and sold. FIA then changed its name to The Center for American Archaeology (at Northwestern University). CAA paid off I-SEP’s debts and Bergers donated 70 acres of land. A new lodge designed to house 40 students was built. A lab building was provided. Additional research archaeologists were hired, and Bergers identified two major sites for research: Sand Canyon Pueblo, and the Duckfoot Site. Southwest archaeologists coordinated the research design and standards, academic supervision, and selection of staff archaeologists.

In the spring of 1986, knowing that the center was on firm ground, Jo and Ed Berger resigned their positions of executive director and associate director respectively. They were able to pick their successor, Ian Sandy Thompson. So much had been accomplished and the model that drives Crow Canyon today had been tested and functioning for almost 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Edward|title=Crow Canyon: Pioneering Education and Archaeology on the Southwestern Colorado Frontier|date=1st Edition 1993; 2nd Edition 2009|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington Indiana|isbn=978-1-4389-6009-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crow Canyon Today ==

Since its foundation, the mission of Crow Canyon has been to preserve and protect the rich heritage of the ancient Pueblo Indians (or Anasazi) of the American Southwest[3]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crow Canyon Website|url=http://www.crowcanyon.org/index.php/about-us|website=Crow Canyon's Mission|publisher=Crow Canyon Archaeological Center|accessdate=19 June 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to educate the public of the need to preserve and protect archaeological resources. Archaeological research has been conducted in the Mesa Verde region with the goal of teaching archaeology through hands-on experience. Students and teachers alike are invited to participate in research in the archaeological camp.

Key initiatives include education, research, and cultural programs. President and CEO Deborah Gangloff defines Crow Canyon's programs as an opportunity: " to not only learn archaeology and do archaeology...but also to have some fun ".[2]

'''Dance marathons''' are events in which people dance or walk to music for an extended period of time. They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/pfop-dance-marathons-walkathons-once-talk-of-the-town/article_7cc11c8c-a911-5262-bc4e-e992fe8e4a25.html |title= Dance marathons, walkathons once talk of the town |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-03-13 |accessdate= 2016-04-11 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the development of "reality shows", dance marathons blurred the line between theatre and reality. Also known as endurance contests, dance marathons attracted people to compete as a way to achieve fame or win monetary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Renee. [http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Renee/DanceMarathons.html "Dance Marathons"], ''U.S.A. Twenties'', ''[[Grolier]]'', 2004 {{ISBN|0-7172-6019-4}}, 2005 paperback {{ISBN|0-7172-6013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BnoSrB7LJkIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=marathon+dance&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Dance of the sleepwalkers: the dance marathon fad |publisher=Popular Press |last = Calabria|first=Frank M. |accessdate=2010-01-24 |isbn=9780879725709 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 film ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

(novel)|1935 novel]] of the same title written by [[Horace McCoy]], a bouncer at several such marathons,&lt;ref&gt;Carol J. Martin, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AFSfJ07LlhQC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=marathon+dance&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=horace%20mccoy&amp;f=false |title=Dance marathons: performing American culture of the 1920s and 1930s |publisher=Univ.

* exploitation of the poor, by promoters, during the Great Depression
|date=February 2015}}

Dance marathons became popular in the United States during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonny Watson |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/d5marthn.htm |title=Dance Marathons - aka Continuos Motion Derbies and Pageants of fatique Main1 |website=Streetswing.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of dance marathons began in 1923 when a woman named Alma Cummings danced continuously for 27 hours with six different partners. After Cummings established her record, dance marathons became common in the United States. Initially, participants competed in order to break Cummings's record, but later on people began to compete to win prizes,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Solis |first=Kimberly |url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Dance_Marathons |title=Dance Marathons |website=Dance.lovetoknow.com |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could range from money to publicity.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;“Dance Marathon” Sonny Watson’s StreetSwing.com. January 1, 2013. Accessed April 8,2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance marathons were a huge hit during the Great Depression as they provided contestants and spectators food, shelter and the opportunity to earn cash prizes, at a time when many people needed a meal and free entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The dances were popular at this time  not only because these events supplied  basic human needs to both the contestants and audience, but are also popular due to the sadistic pleasure, or power the audience felt through watching the contestants compete in the grueling event.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

The depression era marathons faded in the public's enthusiasm in the late 1930s due to increased municipal ordinances and the decreased number of towns where the seamier side of the promotions were unknown. The improving economic conditions and the American entry into World War II also contributed to their demise.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

== Rules ==
Rules vary widely, but one common rule of the marathon stated that the participants could not fall asleep, although some marathons would allow one part of the team to sleep as long as their teammates continued dancing. It was important for the team to keep moving because if they stopped, they would be disqualified from the contest.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Contestants were only allowed to leave the dance floor for hygienic or medical purposes, to change clothing, or for other similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Farrel, James. "The dance marathons." Melus 18, no. 1 (Spring93 1993): 133. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of other elements were incorporated in the marathons including elimination sprints, raffles, mud wrestling and fake weddings of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/04/bop-till-you-drop-americas-dance-marathons-no-miracles-here-edinburgh-festival | title=Bop till you drop: The staggering true stories behind America's dance marathons| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2017-08-04| last1=Winship| first1=Lyndsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, the type of music played at a dance marathon changed throughout the duration of it. It consisted of a mix of slow and upbeat music to give the contestants breaks and also keep them going and energized.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Spectators were allowed to come in and watch the marathon and the contestants competing. Often, viewers were able to pay 25 cents to watch the marathon for as long as they wished.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Opposing groups ==
Although many people supported marathons because they were sources of entertainment, there were outside groups that opposed the marathons. Some external groups did not like what the marathons were doing to participants. Movie theater owners, church groups, and women's groups were among those that opposed the marathons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Movie theatre owners were unhappy because people were paying to watch the marathons instead of attending films. Churches were unhappy with the way that the contestants danced with each other as it was not socially acceptable during the time period. Women's groups were upset because they thought it was unethical to charge spectators to watch dancers humiliate themselves.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1928, Seattle passed an ordinance prohibiting dance marathons within city limits when a woman attempted suicide after competing in a 19-day marathon and receiving 5th place.&lt;ref name="history link"&gt;{{cite web|author=Becker, Paula|title=Dance Marathons of the 1920s and 1920s|website=HistoryLink.org|date=August 25, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2015|url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states followed Seattle's precedent shortly after. Although marathons were extremely popular, they were also dangerous. During a marathon in the 1920s, a man named Homer Morehouse was the first contestant to dance in the marathon, but after dancing for 87 hours, he collapsed from exhaustion and died on the dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2013/01/10/10-fads-that-killed-people/4 |title=10 Fads That Killed People - CraveOnline |website=Mandatory.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity dance marathons==
Today, over 250 colleges and high schools nationwide participate in dance marathons of some sort to raise money for children's hospitals. Some raise money under the Children's Miracle Network and with their help, while others are entirely student-run and operate to benefit partnered charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |title=ABC's of Dance Marathon |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731053926/http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |archivedate=2014-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, students organize and host different types of dance marathon events in which participants stand on their feet for 12–46 hours straight.

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17541">'''Drug education''' is the planned provision of information, resources, and skills relevant to living in a world where [[drugs|psychoactive substances]] are widely available and commonly used for a variety of both medical and non-medical purposes, some of which may lead to harms such as [[drug overdose|overdose]], [[injury]], infectious [[disease]] (such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]]), or [[substance dependence|addiction]].

==Benefits==
Planning includes developing strategies for helping children and young people engage with relevant drug-related issues during opportunistic and brief contacts with them as well as during more structured sessions.  Drug education enables children, youth and adults to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to appreciate the benefits of living healthily (which may or may not include the use of psychoactive substances), promote responsibility towards the use of drugs and relate these to their own actions and those of others, both now and in their future lives. It also provides opportunities for people to reflect on their own and others' attitudes to various psychoactive substances, their use and the people who use them.

==Drug education campaigns &amp; programs==
Drug education can be given in numerous forms, some more effective than others. Examples include [[advertising]] and awareness raising campaigns such as the UK Government’s [[FRANK (drugs)|FRANK]] campaign or the US "media campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacampaign.org/ Media campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are school based drug education programs like [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] or that currently being evaluated by the UK Blueprint Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/young-people/blueprint Blueprint], ''Home office.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to prevent problematic substance use, drug education may perpetuate myths and stereotypes about psychoactive substances and people who use them.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Drugs, discourses and education: A critical discourse analysis of a high school drug education text|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/01596300801966864}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug education can also take less explicit forms; an example of this is the Positive Futures Programme, funded by the UK government as part of its drug strategy. This programme uses [[sport]] and the [[arts]] as catalysts to engage young people on their own turf, putting them in contact with positive role models (coaches/trained youth workers). After building a trusting relationship with a young person, these role models can gradually change attitudes towards drug use and steer the young person back into education, [[training]] and [[employment]]. This approach reaches young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. It also has additional benefits for the community in reduced [[crime]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/publication-search/young-people/0607_YPSMPG11 Positive Futures Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-based drug education ==
School-based drug education began with the anti-alcohol "[[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] education" programmes of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Jerome|title=100 years of 'just say no' versus 'just say know': Reevaluating drug education goals for the coming century|journal=Evaluation Review|year=1998|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–45|doi=10.1177/0193841x9802200102}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many respects, the WCTU's [[progressive education]] agenda set the template for much of what has been done since in the name of drug education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research into drug education has indicated that to be effective it must involve engaging, interactive learning strategies that stimulate higher-order thinking, promote learning and be transferable to real life circumstances.

The [[Australian Government]] has implemented a range of drug education programs through the [[National Drug Education Strategy (NDES)]] by providing schools with effective drug education programmes. The program aims  to manage drug related issues and incidents within schools .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Schools Drug Education Strategy 2009|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|work=Northern Territory Government|publisher=Department of Education and Children Services|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035758/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] builds on existing drug education resources developed by researchers at the [https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC)] such as the [https://www.climateschools.com.au/ Climate Schools programs] that have been proven to reduce alcohol and drug related harms and increase student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Champion|title=A cross-validation trial of an Internet-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis: Preliminary results from a cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Aust NZ J Psychiatry|date=2015|volume=50|pages=64–73|doi=10.1177/0004867415577435|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/50/1/64|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Internet-based prevention for alcohol and cannabis use: final results of the Climate Schools course|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105|issue=4|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x/full|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x|pages=749–759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Delivering prevention for alcohol and cannabis using the internet: A cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2009|volume=48|issue=6|pages=579–584|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Department of Health and Aging]] identified that analgesics (90%), alcohol (80-90%) and tobacco (30-60%) were the most widely utilised substances among adolescents. In addition to this, cannabis was another commonly used illicit substance that accounted for 33% usage among adolescents aged 14–17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=B|title=School drug education in New South Wales: Moral panic and the individualisation youth drug use|journal=Social Alternatives|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government funded programs, a number of not-for-profit organisations (such as [[Life Education Australia]] also provide drug education programs to adolescents. These preventative programs aim to deliver a progressive approach that will motivate and encourage young people to make positive decisions in life. Emphasis within these programs is also placed in focusing on deterring [[peer pressure]] as a means of empowering adolescents and promoting autonomy. This approach reaches 750,000 primary and secondary students in Australia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=R|author2=O’Connor, L.|title=Life Education: Research and Evaluation.|journal=Life Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.A.R.E, Drug Abuse Resistance Education ==
D.A.R.E stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. In the United States, D.A.R.E is implemented in elementary school classrooms, 5th grade to educate students on drugs effects and temptations they may encounter. The program implemented in public and private school systems to prepare 5th graders for middle school, as well as all further education.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although D.A.R.E is implemented to prevent students from doing drugs in the future, there is little evidence to suggest it actually prevents students from doing drugs. In the article, “Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education” by Dukes and Stein, a [[chi-squared test]] was performed to see if there was a significant difference between high school students that received D.A.R.E training and those who did not receive D.A.R.E and its relation to drug use. The study found that there is no significant difference between the drug use of students that received D.A.R.E and students that did not. One of the main reasons the authors mentioned D.A.R.E had little correlation with Drug use is that there are other external causes that only affect some students, which can lead them into the direction of drug use. Additionally, the time that students received D.A.R.E (5th grade), and the time that the students encounter drugs may be many years after, so students may have little remembrance of the program. However, the United States schools continue to implement the program in classrooms because the police officers that come into classrooms can serve as community role models to students, and all students are different so it may steer them away from drugs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Steroid use in high schools ==
Steroid use is a common form of drug use in high schools across the United States. Many students, specifically males, use steroids to increase their performance in athletic events. Many professional athletes, for example professional cyclist, Lance Armstrong, and former professional MLB player, Alex Rodriguez both were nationally recognized as steroid users. Additionally in an article in the ''Journal of Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology,'' it states that in a survey of  212 Canadian national track athletes, over 10% of them would take an illegal drug if it was undetectable, if it could help them win an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Bradley D.|date=March 2018|title=Detection of Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use by Elite Athletes and by Members of the General Public|url=|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology|volume=464|pages=21-27|via=EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adolescents idolize athletes, so when they find out there is a way to enhance their performance, and that elite athletes are using them, steroids may be used by students. 

An article in the ''Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse'' ran a study on two southern California high schools in middle class suburbs, and the high school students use of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids. It surveyed students on if they use steroids, knew the side effects of steroids, and additionally their use of other prevalent drugs. The article specifically found that male students that were athletes were more likely to use steroids than students that are female or non- athlete students in general. Most students that participated in steroids played the sports, football or soccer, and were most likely to do steroids if they participated in both sports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorang|first=Melissa|date=September 2011|title=Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use in Teens: Prevalence, Demographics, and Perception of Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=20|pages=358–369|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Professional sports, influence young athletes, and when pro- athletes participate in drugs, it can lead young adults to use drugs without realizing the side effects and consequences that come along with drug use.

Also, a study in the ''journal of Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy'' discusses alcohol and drug prevention programs in Australia for students in grades 8 and 9. It goes into detail about the student's between 13 and 15 years old, to see if alcohol and drug prevention programs have an actual effect on preventing substance abuse. The study comes to conclusion that when the students went through a drug and alcohol prevention program, they were less likely to develop a drug or alcohol problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midford|first=Richard|last2=et al.|date=April 2012|title=Alcohol Prevention: What Can Be Expected of a Harm Reduction? Focused School Drug Education Program?|url=|journal=Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy|volume=19, no. 2|pages=102-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and Drug Education ==
The University of North Carolina Greensboro has researched the drug prevention program, All Stars, Sr.,. The program is developing education through technology (videos), so that health education programs could reach schools in rural communities. The technology programs would provide drug/ health education in general with qualified instructors, in areas that do not have programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=David L|last2=et. al|date=July 2010|title=Going the Distance: Delivery of High School Drug Prevention via Distance Education|url=|journal=American Journal of Distance Education|volume=24.3|pages=151-162|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ==
Recent studies have identified that a gap between the theory of education programmes and the implementation exists.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; This is regards to the collaborative learning approach and difficulties with teachers adopting these interactive drug education programmes. The practical implications of these findings are that professional training and support are required to increase the effectiveness of teaching staff, and the uniform implementation of drug curriculum.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; Additional drug education research in the future should acknowledge the complexities of implementing these programmes in a school environment. Furthermore, additional support for teachers, counselors, school administrators and other education professionals should be integrated as a means of being realistic about what constitutes effective drug education and maintaining a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Teaching teachers to just say 'know': Reflections on drug education|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2007.08.007}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration to the areas that have real and consequential effect on the members of the society.  Subject areas are, but not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. In the area of economics it is a commentary on [[economic materialism]]. It reflects, examines and investigates the excessive desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs and often means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way, by means of two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other manner. It aims at a reflection, examination, or investigation of the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of the capitalist system is to deliver profit for private investors, or corporations (without consideration of consequences including human and environmental), as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. Said structure provides incomparable contribution to economic growth, employment and prosperity. According to [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Southern Cone Model: The Political Economy of Regional Capitalist Development in Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w0N-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=excessive+economic+determinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=excessive%2520economic%2520determinism&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134327089|first = Nicola|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5CEGwRutaEEC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780742508934|first = Fernando Henrique|last = Cardoso|first2 = Mauricio Augusto|last2 = Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crafting Qualitative Research: Working in the Postpositivist Traditions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KtDKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317473695|first = Pushkala|last = Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lc6b1Q1Kf1YC|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|date = 1994-01-01|isbn = 9781843768647|first = Philip|last = Arestis|first2 = Malcolm C.|last2 = Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of choice is illusory and society is positioned to function as a reliable producer of excess, the lubricant of the capitalist engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in [[Downtown News]] weekly in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downtown News]], Excessivism Manifesto, September 28, 2015 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/architect_and_engineer_of_california_vol_22_1910.pdf |title=The Architect and Engineer of California Volume 22 |publisher=The Architect and Engineer Co. |date=August 1910 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled ''Excess The New Norm''.

A '''funerary cult''' is a body of [[anthropology of religion|religious]] teaching and practice centered on the [[veneration of the dead]], in which the living are thought to be able to confer benefits on the dead in the [[afterlife]] or to appease their otherwise wrathful [[ghost]]s. Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of [[priest]]s appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the [[tomb]]s of the dead themselves or at [[mortuary temple]]s appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Yayoi Shirai, "Ideal and reality in Old Kingdom private funerary cults", in ''The Old Kingdom Art and Archaeology'', Miroslav Bárta, ed.;  (Czech Institute of Egyptology, 2004), pp. [http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/shirai_okaa_2006.pdf 325 et. seq.], accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cults==

===Egypt===
Funerary cults are especially associated with [[ancient Egypt]], where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Osiris]], who was the [[dying and reviving god]] and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a [[mummy]] in [[Egyptian art]]. Also at [[Bubastis]], where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.&lt;ref&gt;(p50 1910 encyclopedia  Britannica)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
The [[Roman Empire]] also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus.  Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each [[Roman God]] had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest.  He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;(The cults of the Roman Empire By Robert Turcan, p 312-313)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
In [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Babylonia]], funerary cults were called ''kispu.'' This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care.  Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force.  With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Bayliss, "The Cult of Dead Kin in Assyria and Babylonia", ''Iraq'', v. 35, no. 2. seq.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4199959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bram Jagersma, "The Calendar of the Funerary Cult in Ancient Lagash", ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', v.: 64 nos: 3-4, pp 289-307 [http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?id=2023945&amp;url=article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The ancient [[Greek hero cult]] was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a ''[[hero]]'' was a deified or [[demigod|semi-divine]] ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspect: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;A companion to Greek Religion, by Daniel Ogden, p113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Peninsula===
The [[Samnium|Samnite]]s and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] of the Italian peninsula, who painted the underworld deities [[Aita]], [[Vanth]], [[Phersipnei]], and Letham on the walls of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;G.

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
The [[British Humanist Association]]'s [https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/ definition of Humanism]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London.

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

===Scholarly tradition===
====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-theistic worldviews===
====Secular humanists====
{{main|Secular humanism}}

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two. It is only in the definition of religion and in the practice of the philosophy that Religious and Secular Humanists effectively disagree. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130233229/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} A decidedly anti-theistic version of secular humanism, however, is developed by Adolf Grünbaum, 'In Defense of Secular Humanism' (1995), in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol. I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

'''Information and communication technologies for environmental sustainability''' ('''ICT Ensure''') or Green ICT as per the  International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT" is a general term referring to the application of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) within the field of [[environmental sustainability]]. Information and communication technologies are acting as integrating and enabling technologies for the economy and they profoundly affect our society. Recent changes in ICT use globally have damaged the environment (in terms of waste and energy consumption etc.) but also have the potential to support environmental sustainability activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murugesan | first1 = S. | last2 = Laplante | first2 = P.

New technologies provide utilities for knowledge acquisition and awareness, early evaluation of new knowledge, reaching agreements and communication of progress in the interest of the [[Quality of life|human welfare]]. This includes ethical aspects of protecting human life as well as aspects of consumer safety and the preservation of our [[natural environment]].

==Application areas==
More and more application areas are becoming relevant to sustainable development in industry, [[health care]], [[agriculture]] and the [[information society]], and they affect the perspectives of ICT, the environment, policy and science. More and more interest has been emerged as well to [[risk management|risk]] and [[disaster management]], adaptation to [[climate change]] and resource use.

'''The International Summer University''' is a short-term program that is held during the summer season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; University Kassel organizes the ISU as one of its internationalization strategies.

The program of the ISU is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971. During the winter season the University Kassel offers the [[International Winter University (IWU) Kassel]]. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of the ISU/IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and development of the programme==
The International Summer University started as one of the Hessen International Summer Universities that have been designed to attract international students to [[Hessen]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.isu-hessen.de Hessen International Summer Universities (ISU) homepage] for reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, ISU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of University Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, ISU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to ISU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, ISU has brought some 50 international students to Kassel every year. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries.

The uniqueness of ISU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and [[cultural heritage]]. While ISU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program have been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, ISU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus.



==Program of study==
The study program of ISU includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in "'teaching German as a foreign language"'. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for the engineering module usually cover the following topics: [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation strategies to climate change]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and integrated environmental science [[environmental science]]. Seminars for the German culture module usually covers topics such as [[history of germany]], German politics of the 20th century, [[intercultural communication]], and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|German fairy tales]]. Students proficient in German language may choose the German-taught seminar of "Deutsche Geschichte und Politik im 20. Jahrhundert".

Students will be awarded 9 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [http://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/museums/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


[[Kassel]] is a mid-sized city located in northern Hessen in the center of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000, which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive law and non-positive law discussions ===
{{main|Positive law}}
One definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED, wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules";&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184&lt;/ref&gt; Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction";&lt;ref name="jap" /&gt; Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="Dworkin, [[Law's Empire]], 410"&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests.&lt;ref name="jra" /&gt; Holmes said "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell. "The Path of Law" (1897) 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 at 461.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'' Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, St Thomas.

Latin: "nihil est aliud qau edam rationis ordinatio ad bonum commune, ab eo qi curam communitatis habet, promulgata".&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has both [[positivism|positivist]] and naturalist elements.&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D.

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methods of interpreting (construing) the law. The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

Law professor and former [[United States Attorney General]] [[Edward H. Levi]] noted that the "basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example" - that is, reasoning by comparing outcomes in cases resolving similar legal questions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Levi, ''An Introduction to Legal Reasoning'' (2013), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding procedural efforts taken by a debt collection company to avoid errors, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] cautioned that "legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerman v. Carlisle]]'', 130 S.Ct. 1605, 1614, 559 U.S. 573, 587 (2010), [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], J.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties.

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

=== Further disciplines ===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

The '''''Marburg Journal of Religion''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[electronic journal|online]] [[academic journal]] that publishes articles on empirical and theoretical studies of [[religion]]. The first issue having appeared in April 1996. The original concept was developed by [[Michael Pye]] together with his assistant Richard Böhme, who was the first Web Editor. The editorial team was broadened in 1999 to include Peter Antes ([[Hanover|Hannover]]) and [[Andreas Grünschloß]] ([[Göttingen]]) and in 2007 Edith Franke ([[Marburg]]). Doreen Christen became Web Editor in 2002. The first separate Reviews Editor was Monika Schrimpf (from 2001) and this role was taken up by Katja Triplett from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/ep/0004/about/editorialTeamBio/628]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Library and Information Science''' ('''MLIS''') is the [[master's degree]] that is required for most professional [[librarian]] positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the '''Master of [[Library Science]] (MLS)''', or '''Master of Science in [[Library Science]] (MSLS)''' degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), "The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Information Studies, Master of Information Science, Master of Information, Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq#degree_name_differences|title=Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2006-08-03|website=|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission to MLIS programs normally requires holding a bachelor's degree in any academic discipline, and library schools encourage applications from people with diverse academic backgrounds.

In the [[United Kingdom]] it is more common for a vocational degree in library and information science to bear the standard designation MA or MSc. In most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] universities, bachelor's and master's programs have been merged to create the MLIS/MLISc degree. [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]] committees have discussed global standards for librarian credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.academia.edu/28794488/Librarians_Need_Global_Credentials | title=Backtalk: Librarians Need Global Credentials | publisher=[[Library Journal]] | date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The MLIS or MLS degree is usually acquired from an accredited [[library school]]. ALA accredits 63 programs at 58 institutions across the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association website: {{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq|title=Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALA also offers an overview of international degrees in library and information science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/education/paths/international|title=International Degrees in Library and Information Science|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|language=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALA website provides "Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/guidelines-choosing-masters-program-library-and-information-studies|title=Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2008-06-10|website=|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discusses how to decide whether a master's degree or an [http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/careers/librarycareerssite/whatyouneedassociate associate's degree] will best help you meet your career goals. Prospective and current students will find more information on school selection and academic success on websites like LibraryCareers.org&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://librarycareers.org|title=Library Careers|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hack Library School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hacklibraryschool.com|title=Hack Library School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ALA-accredited programs provide distance-learning opportunities for students through a variety of delivery methods (e.g. online courses). In some cases, students can complete the entire program at a distance; in other cases, some on-campus courses or regional residency may be required &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/accreditedprograms/guidelines-choosing-masters-program-library-and-information-studies|title=Guidelines for Choosing a Master's Program in Library and Information Studies|first=|last=admin|date=10 June 2008|website=ala.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Curriculum==

The MLIS/MLS curriculum can vary widely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Typically both practical and theoretical components are included, often along with a practicum or internship, and students frequently have an opportunity to specialize in one or more aspects of library and information science. Some schools have stringent course requirements, while others are more flexible and offer a wide variety of electives. Coursework may entail traditional library topics, such as [[library reference desk|reference]] work, [[Library catalog|cataloging]], collection development, school libraries, or archiving. There may also be a focus on [[information science]] and [[computer science]] topics, such as [[database]] design, as well as [[information architecture]]. Other skills taught may include [[management]] or [[pedagogy]]. Students generally complete a research project or thesis during the last semester of their program.

==Careers==
People who earn MLIS degrees take on many different roles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/sjsuischool/so-you-want-to-be-a-librarian-106e794628ef|title=So You Want to Be a Librarian|last=Peters|first=Alison|date=2016-11-01|website=Medium|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many different kinds of environments—in libraries and "beyond the stacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondthestacks.info|title=Beyond the Stacks: Innovative Careers in Library and Information Science|website=Beyond the Stacks: Innovative Careers in Library and Information Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, "Librarians work in museums, hospitals, businesses, and public libraries. In their work, librarians research, instruct, and connect people to technology. Librarians build websites, digitize archives, and manage social media. Librarians work with people of all ages, connecting them to information, learning and the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/libcareers/become|title=Become a Librarian|last=American Library Association|first=|date=2016-07-15|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association's LibraryCareers.org site&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; collects information about library and information science careers, work environments, and more.

Many with MLIS degrees use their professional skills in positions without "librarian" in the job title. The San Jose State University School of Information publishes an annual research report on emerging career trends for information professionals, providing a snapshot of job titles in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ischool.sjsu.edu/about/publications/emerging-career-trends-information-professionals-snapshot-job-titles|title=Emerging Career Trends for Information Professionals: A Snapshot of Job Titles|last=San Jose State University School of Information|first=|date=|website=ischool.sjsu.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PAIRS Foundation''', Inc., develops [[experiential learning]] curricula and programs designed to reconcile married couples and prevent divorce. It is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation based in Broward County, Florida. The company was originally established in Virginia as PAIRS, Ltd. in 1983 and as The PAIRS Foundation, Inc. in Florida in 2000. In 2010, PAIRS, Ltd. formally merged into The PAIRS Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunbiz.org Florida Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS Foundation owns copyright to marriage and relationship education programs that are taught by instructors worldwide who are trained, certified and licensed by the foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumer.pairs.com/directory.php PAIRS Instructors]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the trademark,  "skills for successful relationships".

==Mission==

PAIRS Foundation's mission is to "teach those attitudes, emotional understandings, and behaviors that nurture and sustain healthy relationships and to make this knowledge broadly available on behalf of a safer, saner, more loving world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PAIRS 120-hour semester course was   developed in 1975 by marriage and family therapist Lori Heyman Gordon as a graduate program for counseling students at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.; it was one of the first comprehensive educational programs in the United States that sought to reduce marriage and family breakdown through [[Relationship Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "Passage to Intimacy", Fireside Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  The course integrated and  work by  [[Virginia Satir]], [[Daniel Harold Casriel|Daniel Casriel]], [[Murray Bowen]], [[James Framo]], George Bach, Gordon and others.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. "Building Intimate Relationships", "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casriel_website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Lori Heyman|title=From the road to happiness to a relationship roadmap for couples|url=http://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|website=DanielCasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 1982 [[Washington Post]] article featured PAIRS as a new alternative to traditional [[Family Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/03/31/couples-can-this-marriage-be-saved-331 McNees, Pat. "Can This Marriage Be Saved," Washington Post, November 29, 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1997, Carlos Durana, Ph.D., conducted early studies on the impact of the program, many of which were published in industry journals. During that period, articles about the program appeared in ''Newsweek'', ''Time'', ''Cosmopolitan,''  '' Ladies Home Journal'' and ''Psychology Today'' Gordon was also featured in interviews on CNN, NBC's Today Show, Geraldo, The Gordon Elliot Show, and CBN.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "If You Really Loved Me", Science and Behavior, Palo Alto (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation began piloting intensive couples seminars, ranging from one to four days, in the late nineties. A December 1998 ''New Woman'' magazine cover story featured the first-person account of Molly and Chris Hanson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pairs.com/marriage_makeover.html Hanson, Molly. "PAIRS Marriage Makeover," New Woman Magazine, December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2000, the foundation's CEO Seth Eisenberg was a guest on ABC's ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with Bill Maher'' to discuss Florida's Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, mandating relationship skills training in high schools and for couples applying for marriage licenses. O .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=203828&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=2480254  - TV Guide, Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gordon was recognized with the Impact Award of the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education:&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS History]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS was awarded a $5 million federal grant in 2006 by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], to provide classes and conduct a five-year evaluation of the program's impact among English, Spanish and French/Creole-speaking couples and singles in Florida's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2010/04/14/marriages-families-jobs/ Falciglia, Amanda. "Study offers hope for marriages, families, and jobs," FatherhoodChannel.com, April 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PAIRS was featured in a [[Time magazine]] cover story by Belinda Luscombe, "Who Needs Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2032116,00.html Luscombe, Belinda. "Who Needs Marriage," Time Magazine, November 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Time Magazine]] story that month featured a PAIRS [[iPhone]] App and questioned, "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2010/11/01/can-an-iphone-app-save-your%C2%A0marriage/ Luscombe, Belinda. "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage," Time Magazine, November 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] [[Veterans Health Administration]] featured PAIRS in an article about helping Veterans strengthen "their most significant relationships":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs is trying a new path to caring for and healing the nation's wounded Veterans. Now, in addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA is going one step further and helping to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/20121018a.asp Peterson, Hans. "Relationship Retreats: From Warriors to Soul Mates," Veterans Health Administration, October 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in October 2012, PAIRS Foundation's collaboration with the San Diego VA Healthcare System was recognized with the "Spirit of Planetree Award" for the program's impact strengthening relationships between "family, friends and social supports as a central component of patient-centered care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/04/pairs-collaboration-with-va-recognized-with-prestigious-2012-spirit-of-planetree-award-104/ Henthorn, Robert. "PAIRS Collaboration with VA Recognized with Prestigious 2012 Spirit of Planetree Award," FatherhoodChannel.com, October 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetree.org/?page_id=2327 2012 Planetree Program Awards, Human Interactions/Independence, Dignity and Choice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint effort with the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation Initiative, PAIRS Foundation published the ''PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide'' in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/pairs/docs/va_support PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide, January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation produced a video in May 2014 promoting the Warrior to Soul Mate program, supported by the PAIRS curriculum, as a valuable component of VA's efforts to promote health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qDGaW-PbM U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation. "Health for Life: Strengthening Relationships through the Warrior to Soul Mate Program," Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Sacred Trust==

In September 2011, the foundation's [[Operation Sacred Trust]] initiative, launched in collaboration with [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, was awarded a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families ("SSVF"), to help end homelessness for Veteran families in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. An additional $1 million was awarded in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families website]&lt;/ref&gt; Two November 11, 2012 articles featured Operation Sacred Trust as a new model for ending homelessness for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Christiana|title=Operation Sacred Trust Combats Veteran Homelessness In South Florida With $1 Million Grant |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/homeless-veterans-operation-sacred_n_2093151.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman-Eisenberg|first=Stephanie|title=A step forward for homeless vets|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/11/3090081/a-step-forward-for-homeless-vets.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2012, a CBS News story featured Operation Sacred Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newland|first=Maggie|title=Miami Man Turns Life Around, Gives Back to Fellow Veterans|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/miami-man-turns-life-around-gives-back-to-fellow-veterans/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage Equality==

Following the 2014 ruling of [[Robert Lewis Hinkle|U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle]] that Florida's same sex marriage ban violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Rules that Florida Ban on Marriage for Same-Sex Couples is Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/federal-court-rules-florida-ban-marriage-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional/|publisher=ACLU|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAIRS Foundation began offering ''PAIRS for Love, for Life'' classes in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Florida specifically geared to committed, engaged and married same sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://equality.pairs.com PAIRS Classes for Same Sex Couples]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Florida's 1998 Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, completion of the PAIRS class allows same sex couples to receive a discount on marriage licenses and exemption from Florida's typical three-day waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.flrules.org/1998/403 Florida Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act of 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curricula==

"PAIRS Essentials" is a nine-hour curriculum delivered in a group setting, with a PAIRS Instructor, often over a weekend, or in several weekly class sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.pairs.com/essentials/overview.php PAIRS Essentials Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;  "PAIRS For Our Future, For Our Family" is a 30-hour curriculum typically delivered over 12 weekly 2-1/2 hour sessions "&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117/ Henthorn, Robert.

'''Pearl Academy''' (formerly Pearl Academy of Fashion) is an institute offering undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma pathways in design, fashion, media and business.

== History ==
Starting with a campus in [[Okhla]] in South Delhi, the academy later moved to a larger campus in [[Naraina]], in the West of the city.

Expansion saw new campuses being added in [[Jaipur]] (2005) and [[Mumbai]] (2014).&lt;ref name="indianexpress"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/talk/news/in-gear/1084337 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311182054/http://www.indianexpress.com/talk/news/in-gear/1084337 |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Jaipur centre moved to a new custom design-and-build campus in 2008, after which a new campus in [[Noida]] opened in 2012.

In 2011 Pearl entered into a long term partnership with [[Laureate International Universities]], and it is now part of the LIU global network which includes more than 80 institutions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laureate.net/OurNetwork|title=Our Network|website=Laureate.net|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the institute's name was changed to Pearl Academy, in recognition of the growing number of courses in design and business.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The academy now has over 4,500 students and more than 340 academic staff. A large number of guest faculty are also actively involved in teaching and serving on juries for assessment of projects.

==Campuses==
{{As of|May 2017}} the institution has four centres in India:  Delhi NCR West, the academy's oldest campus, located at Naraina; Delhi NCR East which is located in Noida sector 59;Pearl Academy Jaipur, located at Kukas;  and the newest campus in Mumbai located in [[Andheri]].

The Jaipur campus was designed by architects Morphogenesis and completed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/40716/pearl-academy-of-fashion-morphogenesis/|title=Pearl Academy of Fashion / Morphogenesis|date=13 November 2009|website=Archdaily.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design uses traditional cooling methods found in the desert environment of [[Rajasthan]], such as a step-well in the centre and the use of [[Jali]]-inspired structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/pearl-academy-london/|title=Pearl Academy of Fashion by Morphogenesis|website=Inhabitat.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the award for 'Best Learning Building' at the World Architecture Festival awards held in Barcelona, Spain in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/winners.cfm?eventYear=2009|title=World Architecture Festival|website=Worldarchitecturefestival.com|accessdate=30 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730053127/http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/winners.cfm?eventYear=2009|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaipur campus of Pearl Academy recently hosted the Jaipur Design Carnival. Jaipur Design Carnival was conceived as a designers’ festival to celebrate the power of design. Many creative practitioners from diverse fields design participated in the event. There were panel discussions, fashion show, live music, workshops and display of arte facts. The event was organized by the faculty and students of Pearl Academy Jaipur and the workshops were conducted by students of Pearl Jaipur.

The latest campus (Mumbai) was officially launched on 16 April 2014 by [[Sussanne Khan]], Interior Designer and founder of design studio 'The Charcoal Project', who announced her support for students of the academy by way of Scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aninews.in/videogallery5/22411-sussanne-roshan-teams-up-with-pearl-academy.html|title=Asia’s Premier News Agency - India News, Business &amp; Political, National &amp; International, Bollywood, Sports|website=Aninews.in|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">'''Performance Writing''' was pioneered at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in [[Devon|Devon, UK]] as a radical new approach to writing. It is a multi-modal approach which explores through artistic practice how [[writing]] interacts with other art forms and practices — [[visual art]], [[sound art]], [[video art|time-based media]], [[installation art|installation]], [[electronic literature]], [[Artist's book|bookworks]], and [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Writing/446221925633?v=info&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Performance Writing was inaugurated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] undergraduate course at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1994. The course was written, and the field developed, by a number of self-described Performance Writers and academics including John Hall, Ric Allsopp, [[Caroline Bergvall]], Aaron Williamson, Brigid Mc Leer, Alaric Sumner, [[Redell Olsen]], [[cris cheek]], Peter Jager, Barbara Bridger, Melanie Thompson, Jerome Fletcher, and many others, and enriched by an program of visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen"&gt;John Hall, ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing: a Lecture'', Plymouth, UK: Plymouth College of Art Press, 2007. (A more extensive list of performance writers is given on p.35.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the merger of DCA and [[University College Falmouth]] ( now [[Falmouth University]] in 2010, the undergraduate Performance Writing course was relocated to a new performance centre at Tremough Campus (now [[Penryn Campus]]) near [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. The course ceased taking applications for new students from 2010 onwards pending a reconfiguration of its Performance Writing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013037/http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment has not resumed.

The [[Falmouth University]] post-graduate [[Master of Arts]] course in Performance Writing led by Associate Professor of Performance Writing Jerome Fletcher ran for two years at the [[Arnolfini]] in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/201/courses-7/postgraduate-courses-43/performance-writing-ma-1688.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment to the MA Performance Writing was ceased in 2012. Performance Writing continues at the postgraduate and research level at [[Falmouth University]].

The democratic, inclusive, and above all extensible nature of Performance Writing methodology has led to its adoption and adaptation by both independent and academic researchers, practitioners, pedagogs, and institutions in places as far flung as Oakland, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacket2.org/commentary/what-performance-writing|title= What is performance writing? |publisher=Jacket2|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Banff Centre]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca//programs/program.aspx?id=1393|title=In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge|publisher=The Banff Centre|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Performance Writing methodologies and sensibilities have spread – primarily through graduates of the program at Dartington – into a rich diversity of artistic forms and institutional formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luckysoap.com/lapsuslinguae/2013/07/writing-on-writing-on-performance-writing/|title=Writing on Writing on Performance Writing |publisher=J. R. Carpenter|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of definition==
As an emerging field, its definition and limits are the subject of ongoing debate. John Hall's lecture ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing'', explores [[definition]] as a process, using playful and precise language to establish the complexity of reflexive descriptions: a performance of writing about writing as such.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen" /&gt;

At the symposium launching the field, Performance Writing was described by Caroline Bergvall as exploring "relationships between textual and text-based work when developed in conjunction with other media and discourses.", and opening "the investigation of formal and ideological strategies which writers and artists develop textually in response or in reaction to their own time and their own fields"&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote"&gt;Caroline Bergvall, [http://www.carolinebergvall.com/content/text/BERGVALL-KEYNOTE.pdf Keynote Paper for Performance Writing Symposium], Dartington, U.K. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also understood it as "not primarily [a] unified academic discipline [or] one delineated, hybridic artform", but rather as an "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into."&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote" /&gt;

==Events==
Performance Writing events so far include two symposia; one at Dartington College of Arts in 1996 and a second at the Theatre School in Utrecht in 1999.

In May 2010 Bristol's [[Arnolfini]], in collaboration with University College Falmouth, held ''PW10'': a weekend of Performance Writing themed talks, readings, and artistic works exploring [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to language and [[textuality]]. It was timed to coincide with the exhibition ''Say: "Parsley"'' by Performance Writing co-founder [[Caroline Bergvall]] and Ciaran Maher. It included works by [[Allen Fisher]], [[Drew Milne]], [[David Prior (artist)]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[J.R. Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 Arnolfini Programme 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302211816/http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 PW12 was held at [[Arnolfini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''[[Performing arts]] presenting organizations''' facilitate exchanges between artists and audiences through creative, educational, and performance opportunities. The work that these artists perform is produced outside of the presenting organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urban.org/url.cfm?ID=410604 "The Capacity of Performing Arts Presenting Organizations,"] by Mark A. Hager and Thomas H. Pollak, The [[Urban Institute]], Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing arts presenters are typically found in three varieties:
*Those attached to a college, university, or other educational institution, with performances usually taking place on campus;
*Those that are an administrative branch of a theater or concert hall, usually presenting performances only in that space;
*Those that are independently administered outside any specific venue, usually renting multiple venues for performances.


The [[Association of Performing Arts Presenters]], located in Washington, D.C., is the largest organizing body of performing arts presenters in the United States. The primary international organizing body of performing arts presenters is the International Society for the Performing Arts.[http://www.ispa.org/]

==Performing arts presenters in the United States==
* [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] ([[Boston, Massachusetts]])
* [[Rockport Music]] ([[Rockport, Massachusetts]])
* [[University Musical Society]] ([[Ann Arbor, Michigan]])
* [[Whitefish Theatre Company]] ([[Whitefish, Montana]])
* [[Hopkins Center for the Arts]] ([[Dartmouth College]], [[Hanover, New Hampshire]])
* [[The Music Hall (Portsmouth)|The Music Hall]], ([[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana.

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rectal douching''' (also known as '''anal douching''') is the act of rinsing the [[rectum]] with intent to clean it, typically in preparation for [[anal sex]]. An instance of this rinsing or a tool used to perform the rinse may be called a '''rectal douche'''.

==Uses==
Rectal douching is a [[hygienic]] practice to clean the rectum in preparation for anal sex or hydrating the rectum to void hardened stools as opposed to a pharmaceutical method to soften the stool.

Rectal douching is distinguished from [[anal cleansing]], which is the routine cleaning of the [[anus]] after [[defecation]], and [[enema]], which is the rinsing of part of the [[large intestine]].

==Risks==
Evidence is not clear, but it is possible that rectal douching before [[anal sex]] can increase the risk of transferring [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carballo-Diéguez|first1=Alex|last2=Bauermeister|first2=José A.|last3=Ventuneac|first3=Ana|last4=Dolezal|first4=Curtis|last5=Balan|first5=Ivan|last6=Remien|first6=Robert H.|title=The Use of Rectal Douches among HIV-uninfected and Infected Men who Have Unprotected Receptive Anal Intercourse: Implications for Rectal Microbicides|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=12|issue=6|year=2007|pages=860–866|issn=1090-7165|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|pmc=2953367}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that douching sometimes can disrupt the [[epithelium]], or tissue in the rectum, and if this tissue is damaged then HIV can spread more easily.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"/&gt;

Rectal douching before anal sex increases the risk of transfer of [[Hepatitis B]].&lt;ref name="SchreederThompson1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreeder|first1=M. T.|last2=Thompson|first2=S. E.|last3=Hadler|first3=S. C.|last4=Berquist|first4=K. R.|last5=Zaidi|first5=A.|last6=Maynard|first6=J. E.|last7=Ostrow|first7=D.|last8=Judson|first8=F. N.|last9=Braff|first9=E.

There are reports that activities which can have the side effect of causing unintentional forcing of water into the rectum, such as [[waterskiing]], may cause discomfort but can potentially bring other harms.&lt;ref name="Kizer1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kizer|first1=Kenneth W.|title=Medical hazards of the water skiing douche|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=5|year=1980|pages=268–269|issn=0196-0644|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(80)80387-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Rectal bulb syringe.jpg|thumb|right|The nozzle tip is inserted into the rectum then the bulb is squeezed to release water.]]
Liquid, typically water, is inserted into the rectum by means of some tool. After some time, the water is expelled in the manner of a routine bowel movement, and in the process the rectum eliminates waste and becomes more clean.

Most people who use rectal douching do so with plain water.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; The use of a hose connected to a tap, either in a shower or sink, has been reported as the most popular way to administer a douche.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; Another popular way is with a handheld bulb and syringe designed for rectal douching.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

Less commonly, some people used commercial products sold for performing rectal douching, with single-use bottles of saline being most used.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; Also commercially available but even less commonly used for rectal douching are mineral oil products intended to assist in an enema.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

==Frequency of use==
Rectal douching is a common practice among people who take a receptive role in anal sex.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Javanbakht|first1=Marjan|last2=Stahlman|first2=Shauna|last3=Pickett|first3=Jim|last4=LeBlanc|first4=Marc-André|last5=Gorbach|first5=Pamina M|title=Prevalence and types of rectal douches used for anal intercourse: results from an international survey|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|volume=14|issue=1|year=2014|pages=95|issn=1471-2334|doi=10.1186/1471-2334-14-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2014 study of about 5000 gay males in the United States reported that half of them had used douching at least once and most used tap water.&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=SW|last2=Rosser|first2=BR|title=Enema use among men who have sex with men: a behavioral epidemiologic study with implications for HIV/STI prevention.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=May 2014|volume=43|issue=4|pages=755–69|pmid=24346864|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0203-0|pmc=4011986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among study participants, those who were [[people of color]], [[HIV-positive people]], with a [[sexually transmitted infection]], [[Top, bottom and versatile#Versatile|sexually versatile]], or who in their lifetime had unprotected sex with more than two partners were more likely to have recently used rectal douching.&lt;ref name="Noor"/&gt;

One small study of gay males included a survey in which respondents who habitually used rectal douching began doing it regularly around age 25.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"/&gt; For all demographics, the average age at which a population might start using rectal douching is older than the average age at which that population started engaging in anal sex.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

==History==
A rectal douche device was patented in 1957 in the United States by [[Patricia Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = US2811156 A | status = patent | title = Rectal douche | pubdate = 29 October 1957 | gdate = | fdate = 2 December 1955 | pridate = 2 December 1955 | inventor = [[Patricia Bragg]] | invent1 =  | invent2 =  | assign1 =  | assign2 =  | class = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

The '''Regional Science Association International''' ('''RSAI''') is a cluster of scholarly societies whose members engage in [[regional science]].

==Origins==
In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the economist [[Walter Isard]] worked to draw together a group of academics interested in analyzing regional (i.e., sub-national) development. These academics were drawn from a number of disciplines: economics, geography, city planning, political science and rural sociology. Naming their new approach ''regional science'', they envisioned it as an interdisciplinary effort, one that would require unique theoretical concepts, methodological tools, and data. Because their effort was interdisciplinary, no existing academic organization brought the participants together; they therefore created their own organization, the ''Regional Science Association'', which first met in December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, the RSA had 960 members, and its first local "section", which organized conferences for regional scientists located in the western United States. The next section to form (in 1963) was in Japan, followed by sections throughout Europe, as well as in India, Argentina, and Brazil. In 1969, the Western section and the Japan section began to cooperate in holding a biennial ''Pacific Rim'' international conference.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually issues of coordination among the various sections were worked out, resulting in much the present structure by 1990. The ''Regional Science Association International'' (RSAI) now functions as the umbrella organization for three other organizations: the ''Pacific Regional Science Conference Organization'', the ''North American Regional Science Council'', and the ''European Regional Science Association''. Each of these serve as the umbrella organization for a number of other organizations, as seen in the next section.

A '''scientific controversy''' is a substantial disagreement among [[scientist]]s. A scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. For example, the connection between [[race and intelligence]] has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.

When compared to [[controversies]], scientific controversies are specific to scientific related arguments, whereas regular controversies entail a much larger range. More specifically, a scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. A scientific controversy is an argument where they cannot agree on a method, theory, or hypothesis. It influences how we interpret the data to make a conclusion that best fits the data and/or evidence. Scientific controversies are healthy and can be helpful in getting scientists to think of the best ways to do things as well as different ways to approach topics. In addition, they can also help science move forward. Scientific controversies usually create media attention which allows for more people to become aware of the situation and topic being disagreed. This can create an increase in research on the topic. Although, if there are conflicts between scientific views and non-scientific views, this can hurt scientific research.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/_0_0/sciencetoolkit_06 What controversy: Is a controversy misrepresented or blown out of proportion?]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of controversies. The main type being fundamental and secondary scientific controversies. Fundamental scientific controversies are controversies that are based on the main idea of hypotheses or theories. Meaning the central idea of a topic and not the ideas that surround it which would be secondary scientific controversies. For example, there is skepticism in the general population if there is global warming but in contrast, the majority of the scientific community agree there is global warming. This is a fundamental scientific controversy because it is the main idea. The real issue, the secondary scientific controversy, is how fast is it occurring and how to model it which is what is being researched and debated. It is important to distinguish between these two so that the real scientific issue does not get missed.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

Controversies between scientific and non-scientific ideas are not within the realm of science and are not true scientific controversies.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Semiotic democracy''' is a phrase first coined by [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], a [[media studies]] [[professor]], in his seminal media studies book ''Television Culture'' (1987).&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;John Fiske, ''Television Culture'' (Routledge, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Fiske defined the term as the "delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to [television's] viewers."&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt;{{rp|236}} Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show's producer.

Subsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of [[cultural imagery]] by someone who is not the original author. Examples include [[fan fiction]] and [[slash fiction]].

Legal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, [[copyright]] and [[right-to-publicity]] law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 ''Cultural Studies'' 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. [[Terry Fisher]] of [[Harvard Law School]] has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.&lt;ref&gt;William W Fisher, ''Promises to Keep: Technology, Law and the Future of Entertainment'' (Stanford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sewing'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sewing  |title=Sewing|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[craft]] of fastening or attaching objects using [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] made with a [[sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]]. Sewing is one of the oldest of the [[textile arts]], arising in the [[Paleolithic]] era. Before the invention of [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] yarn or [[weaving]] [[textiles|fabric]], [[archaeology|archaeologist]]s believe Stone Age people across [[Europe]] and Asia sewed [[fur]] and [[leather|skin]] [[clothing]] using [[bone]], [[antler]] or [[ivory]] needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts including [[tendon|sinew]], [[catgut]], and [[vein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anawalt (2007), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand.  The invention of the [[sewing machine]] in the 19th century and the rise of [[computer]]ization in the 20th century led to [[mass production]] and [[export]] of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality [[tailor]]ing, [[haute couture]] [[fashion]], and custom [[dressmaking]], and is pursued by both [[textile artist]]s and [[hobby]]ists as a means of creative expression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The first known use of the word "sewing" was in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sewing?show=0&amp;t=1337966896|title=Sewing|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:A seated woman sewing a kimono.jpg|thumb|''Seated woman sewing a [[kimono]]'', [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], early 19th century. Different cultures have developed diverse sewing techniques, from methods of cutting fabric to types of stitches.]]
Sewing has an ancient history estimated to begin during the [[Paleolithic Era]].&lt;ref name="kooler10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kooler|first=Donna|title=Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Sewing: Hand &amp; Machine Sewing: 12 Projects|year=2009|publisher=Leisure Arts|isbn=9781601404565|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter. The [[Inuit]], for example, used [[sinew]] from [[caribou]] for thread and needles made of bone;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Canadian Ground|url=http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/expositions-exhibitions/chaussure-footwear/english/exhibition/ki/sdt.html|publisher=The Bata Shoe Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the indigenous peoples of the American Plains and Canadian Prairies used sophisticated sewing methods to assemble [[tipi]] shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holley|first=Linda A.|title=Tipis, Tepees, Teepees: History and Design of the Cloth Tipi|year=2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=9781586855116|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves in Africa to create baskets, such as those made by [[Zulu people|Zulu]] weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as "thread" to stitch wider strips of palm leaf that had been woven into a coil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bantu-Speaking Peoples of Southern Africa|year=1980|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780710007087|page=119|editor=W. D. Hammond-Tooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weaving of cloth from [[natural fibres]] originated in the Middle East around 4000 BC, and perhaps earlier during the [[Neolithic Age]], and the sewing of cloth accompanied this development.&lt;ref name=Sekhri&gt;{{cite book|last=Sekhri|first=Seema|title=Textbook of Fabric Science Fundamentals to Finishing|year=2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120341838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Europeans who could afford it employed [[seamstress]]es and [[tailor]]s. Sewing for the most part was a woman's occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical. Clothing was an expensive investment for most people, and women had an important role in extending the longevity of items of clothing. Sewing was used for [[mending]]. Clothing that was faded would be turned inside-out so that it could continue to be worn, and sometimes had to be taken apart and reassembled in order to suit this purpose. Once clothing became worn or torn, it would be taken apart and the reusable cloth sewn together into new items of clothing, made into [[quilt]]s, or otherwise put to practical use. The many steps involved in making clothing from scratch (weaving, pattern making, cutting, alterations, and so forth) meant that women often bartered their expertise in a particular skill with one another.&lt;ref name="kooler10"/&gt; Decorative needlework such as [[embroidery]] was a valued skill, and young women with the time and means would practise to build their skill in this area. From the Middle Ages to the 17th century, sewing tools such as [[Sewing needle|needle]]s, [[pin]]s and [[pincushion]]s were included in the [[Dowry|trousseaus]] of many European brides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiting|first=Gertrude|title=Old-Time Tools &amp; Toys of Needlework|year=1971 |version=reprint; originally published 1928 by Columbia University Press|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486225173|pages=150–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative embroidery was valued in many cultures worldwide. Although most embroidery stitches in the Western repertoire are traditionally British, Irish or Western European in origin, stitches originating in different cultures are known throughout the world today. Some examples are the Cretan Open Filling stitch, Romanian Couching or Oriental Couching, and the Japanese stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Mary|title=Embroidery Stitches|year=2006|publisher=Struik|isbn=9781770074224|pages=155, 159, 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stitches associated with embroidery spread by way of the trade routes that were active during the Middle Ages. The [[Silk Road]] brought Chinese embroidery techniques to Western Asia and Eastern Europe, while techniques originating in the Middle East spread to Southern and Western Europe through Morocco and Spain.&lt;ref name="leslie2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Catherine Amoroso|title=Needlework Through History: An Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313335488|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; European imperial settlements also spread embroidery and sewing techniques worldwide. However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely. For example, a method of [[appliqué|reverse appliqué]] known to areas of South America is also known to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="leslie2007"/&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:SewingInDetroit,Michigan.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century sewing in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].]]
[[File:Street seamstress vendor Bangkok.jpg|thumb|A woman sewing as a street vendor in [[Bangkok, Thailand]].]]
[[File:Sewing with a 1894 Singer sewing machine.webm|thumb|Sewing with an 1894 [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machine.]]
The Industrial Revolution shifted the production of textiles from the household to the mills. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, the machinery produced whole cloth. The world's first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint.&lt;ref&gt;http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/national-sewing-month-2011_50290c5a9fbfb.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1840s, other early sewing machines began to appear. [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]] introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France's army; shortly afterward, a mob of [[tailor]]s broke into Thimonnier's shop and threw the machines out of  the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Laurie M.|title=Queen of Inventions: How the Sewing Machine Changed the World|year=2003|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761327066|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1850s, [[Isaac Singer]] developed the first sewing machines that could operate quickly and accurately and surpass the productivity of a seamstress or tailor sewing by hand.

While much clothing was still produced at home by female members of the family, more and more ready-made clothes for the middle classes were being produced with sewing machines. Textile [[sweatshop]]s full of poorly paid sewing machine operators grew into entire business districts in large cities like London and New York City. To further support the industry, [[piece work]] was done for little money by women living in slums. Needlework was one of the few occupations considered acceptable for women, but it did not pay a living wage. Women doing piece work from home often worked 14-hour days to earn enough to support themselves, sometimes by renting sewing machines that they could not afford to buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tailors became associated with higher-end clothing during this period. In London, this status grew out of the [[dandy]] trend of the early 19th century, when new tailor shops were established around [[Savile Row]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847885920|page=618|editor=Valerie Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These shops acquired a reputation for sewing high-quality handmade clothing in the style of the latest British fashions, as well as more classic styles. The boutique culture of [[Carnaby Street]] was absorbed by Savile Row tailors during the late 20th century, ensuring the continued flourishing of Savile Row's businesses.

===20th century and today===
[[File:Bangladeshi women sewing clothes.jpg|thumb|[[Bangladesh]]i women sewing clothes.]]
Sewing underwent further developments during the 20th century. As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing pattern]]s grew. Women had become accustomed to seeing the latest fashions in periodicals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, increasing demand for sewing patterns yet more. American tailor and manufacturer [[Ebenezer Butterick]] met the demand with paper patterns that could be traced and used by home sewers. The patterns, sold in small packets, became wildly popular. Several pattern companies soon established themselves. Women's magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century. This practice declined during the later decades of the 20th century, when ready-made clothing became a necessity as women joined the paid workforce in larger numbers, leaving them with less time to sew, if indeed they had an interest.{{Citation needed|reason=Was the reason time, cheapness of clothing, or something else?|date=February 2017}} Today, the low price of ready-made clothing in shops means that home sewing is confined largely to hobbyists in Western countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, with the exception of cottage industries in custom dressmaking and upholstery.

The spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well. In Japan, traditional clothing was sewn together with running  stitch that could be removed so that the clothing could be taken apart and the assorted pieces laundered separately. The tight-locked stitches made by home sewing machines, and the use of Western clothing patterns, led to a movement towards wearing Western-style clothing during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Historical Consumer: Consumption and Everyday Life in Japan, 1850-2000|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230273665|pages=56–7|editor1=Janet Hunter |editor2=Penelope Francks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western sewing and clothing styles were disseminated in sub-Saharan Africa by Christian missionaries from the 1830s onward. Indigenous cultures, such as the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]], were indoctrinated in the Western way of dress as a sign of conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornwell|first=Andrea|title=Readings in Gender in Africa|year=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253345172|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Western hand sewing techniques, and later machine sewing, spread throughout the regions where the European colonists settled. However, a recent examination of new online learning methods demonstrated that technology can be adapted to share knowledge of a culture's traditional sewing methods. Using self-paced online tutorials, a [[Malaysia|Malay]] sewing class learned how to tailor and sew a traditional men's ''[[Baju Kurung]]'' garment in 3 days, whereas a traditional Malay sewing class would have taken 5 days to teach the same information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abdul Salam Zailan Arabee  |author2=Mansur Azmi |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on e-Learning|year=2005|publisher=Academic Conferences Limited|isbn=9781905305124|pages=18–9|editor=Dan Remenyi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in industrial technology, such as the development of [[synthetic fibre]]s during the early 20th century, have brought profound changes to the [[textile industry]] as a whole. Textile industries in Western countries have declined sharply as textile companies compete for cheaper labour in other parts of the world. According to the U.S. Department of Labor "employment of sewers and tailors is expected to experience little or no change, growing 1 percent from 2010 to 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Labor Statistics|first=U.S. Department of Labor|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/sewers-and-tailors.htm#tab-6|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singer Quantum Sewing 2010 to 2020|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BvTdedUpos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that every lost textile job in a Western country in recent years has resulted in 1.5 jobs being created in an [[outsourcing|outsourced]] country such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flanagan|first=Mike|title=The Flanarant: China's textile and clothing challenge in new era|url=http://www.just-style.com/comment/chinas-textile-and-clothing-challenge-in-new-era_id116173.aspx|publisher=just-style|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textile workers who perform tasks with sewing machines, or do detailed work by hand, are still a vital component of the industry, however. Small-scale sewing is also an economic standby in many developing countries, where many people, both male and female, are self-employed sewers.

==Garment construction==
[[File:Tailor at work.jpg|thumb|A [[tailor]] fitting a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]

===Patterns and fitting===
Garment construction is usually guided by a [[pattern (sewing)|pattern]]. A pattern can be quite simple; some patterns are nothing more than a mathematical formula that the sewer calculates based on the intended wearer's measurements. Once calculated, the sewer has the measurements needed to cut the cloth and sew the garment together. At the other end of the spectrum are [[haute couture]] fashion designs. When a couture garment is made of unusual material, or has extreme proportions, the design may challenge the sewer's engineering knowledge. Complex designs are drafted and refitted dozens of times, may take around 40 hours to develop a final pattern, and require 60 hours of cutting and sewing. It is important for a pattern to be created well because the way a completed piece fits is the reason it will either be worn or not. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhati|first1=Mithlesh|title=Basics of Pattern Making|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steele, Valerie  |author2=Patricia Mears, Clare Sauro |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ralph Rucci: The Art of Weightlessness|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300122787|pages=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most clothing today is [[mass production|mass-produced]], and conforms to standard sizing, based on body measurements that are intended to fit the greatest proportion of the population. However, while "standard" sizing is generally a useful guideline, it is little more than that, because there is no industry standard that is "both widely accepted and strictly adhered to in all markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calderin|first=Jay|title=Form and Fashion|year=2009|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=9781592535415|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home sewers often work from  [[pattern (sewing)|patterns]] purchased from companies such as [[Simplicity Pattern|Simplicity]], [[Ebenezer Butterick|Butterick]], [[McCall's]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and many others. Such patterns are typically printed on large pieces of tissue paper; a sewer may simply cut out the required pattern pieces for use but may choose to transfer the pattern onto a thicker paper if repeated use is desired. A sewer may choose to alter a pattern to make it more accurately fit the intended wearer. Patterns may be changed to increase or reduce length; to add or remove fullness; to adjust the position of the waistline, shoulder line, or other seam, or a variety of other adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Veblen|first1=Sarah|title=The Complete Guide to Perfect Fitting|date=2012|publisher=Creative Publishing International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume can be added with elements such as [[pleats]], or reduced with the use of [[dart (sewing)|darts]]. Before work is started on the final garment, test garments may be made, sometimes referred to as [[muslin]]s.

===Sewing tools===
Sewers working on a simple project need only a few sewing tools, such as measuring tape, needle, thread, cloth, and sewing shears. More complex projects may only need a few more simple tools to get the job done, but there are an ever-growing variety of helpful sewing aids available.

In addition to sewing shears, rotary cutters may be used for cutting fabric, usually used with a cutting mat to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches. Special marking pens and chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressing and ironing are an essential part of many sewing projects, and require additional tools. A steam iron is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor's ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

[[Sewing machine]]s are now made for a broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, heavy-duty machines for sewing thicker fabrics (such as leather), computerized machines for embroidery, and [[serger]]s for finishing raw edges of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sewing |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i6-cMRM4L0/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of [[presser foot]] attachments are available for many sewing machines—feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, and a variety of other functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahles|first1=Carol|title=Fine Machine Sewing|date=1996|publisher=The Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of garment sewing===
[[File:Palestinian Tailors with a Passion for Fashion (4185091128).jpg|alt=People at sewing machines in a small garment factory|thumb|Garment construction]]

Seamstresses are provided with the pattern, with the intent of using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the [[grain (fabric)|grain]] or the [[bias cut|bias]] to manipulate fabric stretch. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting materials, such as [[interfacing]], interlining, or [[lining (sewing)|lining]], may be used in garment construction, to give the fabric a more rigid or durable shape.

Before or after the pattern pieces are cut, it is often necessary to mark the pieces to provide a guide during the sewing process. Marking methods may include using pens, pencils, or chalk, tailor's tacks, snips, pins, or thread tracing, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitnick|first1=Sarai|title=The Colette Sewing Handbook|date=2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the normal [[lockstitch]], construction [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumgartel|first=Beth|title=Singer Simple Sewing|year=2009|publisher=Creative Publishing International|isbn=9781589234741|pages=57–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[seam (sewing)|Seam]] types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, [[flat fell seam]], French seam and many others.

===Clothing technology===
[[Clothing technology]] has evolved to a complicated science weighed against the labor cost making positive and negative effects across the globe. Millions of women in Bangladesh and other developing countries have come out of poverty working as Sewing Machine Operators.

===Construction of digital garments===

[[File:Colorful Seams on Digital 3D Clothing.jpg|thumbnail|right|Digital clothing created with virtual sewing machine in a cloth simulation software]]
With the development of cloth simulation software such as CLO3D, Marvelous Designer and Optitex, seamstresses can now draft patterns on the computer and visualize clothing designs by using the pattern creation tools and virtual sewing machines within these cloth simulation programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Virtual Fashion and the Creation of Digital Clothes|url=https://cgelves.com/all-about-virtual-fashion-and-how-are-digital-3d-clothes-made|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4768">__NOTOC__
"'''Sit on My Face'''" is a short song by the members of the comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] which originally appeared on the album ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'' and later appeared on the compilation ''[[Monty Python Sings]]''. Written by [[Eric Idle]], the song's lyrics are sung to the [[melody]] of "[[Sing As We Go]]" by [[Gracie Fields]]. The opening gives way to the voices of [[The Fred Tomlinson Singers]] singing "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me." The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]], such as "when I'm between your thighs you blow me away" and "life can be fine if we both [[69 (sex position)|69]]".

The song opened the 1982 film ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'', where it was lip-synched by [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Terry Jones]] dressed as waiters in a performance which, at the suggestion of Python touring member [[Neil Innes]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]'', episode 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ended with them revealing their bare backsides. In 2002, a similar rendition was mimed by Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Neil Innes at the [[Concert for George]], a memorial concert for [[George Harrison]] which took place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. At the end of this rendition the four men turned their backs to face a portrait of [[George Harrison]], thereby revealing their naked [[buttocks]] and effectively [[mooning]] the Albert Hall audience. More recently it was featured as an animated number in ''[[A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman|A Liar's Autobiography]]'', performed by the London Gay Men's Chorus, both on the recorded soundtrack and live, as a flash mob, during the screening shown during the London Film Festival. The song also opened the second half of Monty Python's [[Monty Python Live (mostly)|2014 reunion shows]] where it accompanied a suggestive dance routine by the 20-strong dance ensemble, with Eric Idle and Michael Palin encouraging an audience singalong. 

==Legal issues==
Prior to the album's release, Monty Python received legal threats for alleged [[copyright infringement]] due to the use of the tune of "Sing as We Go". Nonetheless, the Pythons decided to retain the song.

The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has ruled that the song is [[Actionable indecency|actionably indecent]], concluding that "despite English accent and 'ambient noise' … the lyrics were sufficiently understandable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2001/fcc01090.doc |title=Industry Guidance On the Commission’s Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency |accessdate=30 August 2007 |author=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |date=6 April 2001 |format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, it pursued legal action against [[KGB-FM]], a [[San Diego]], [[California]] [[classic rock]] [[radio station]], for playing the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Blecha|title=Taboo Tunes: A History of Banned Bands &amp; Censored Songs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zCKz7aj9eQC&amp;pg=PA116 |year=2004 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-792-9 |page=116 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually forcing the station to pay [[US$]]9,200 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/graphics/web-fcc970.html |title=FCC Indecency Fines, 1970-2004 |accessdate=30 August 2007 |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |year=2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French adaptation==
A [[French language]] rendition of the song presented in [[Edinburgh]] in 2003 translated the title as "Cum in My Mouth". According to [[record producer|producer]] Rémy Renoux, "Cum in My Mouth is … what Monty Python would have written today." Renoux also pointed out that a literal translation into French would not fit the melody of the song, and claimed that the translation met with the approval of the Monty Python team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ce perroquet est mort: Monty Python in French?

'''Social undermining '''is the expression of negative emotions directed towards a particular person or negative evaluations of the person as a way to prevent the person from achieving his or her [[goal]]s. This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or [[anger]]. The negative evaluation of the person may involve [[criticizing]] his or her actions, efforts or characteristics.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"&gt;Joseph, N. T., Myers, H. F., Schettino, J. R., Olmos, N. T., Bingham-Mira, C., Lesser, I. M., &amp; Poland, R. E. (2011). Support and undermining in interpersonal relationships are associated with treatment response to a trial of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 74(3), 240-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and [[office politics|co-workers]]. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive [[interpersonal relationship]], success and a good [[reputation]].&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenbaum | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Mawritz | first2 = M. | last3 = Eissa | first3 = G. | year = 2012 | title = Bottom-line mentality as an antecedent of social undermining and the moderating roles of core self-evaluations and conscientiousness | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 343–359 | doi=10.1037/a0025217 | pmid=22268488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of how an employee can use social undermining in the work environment are behaviors that are used to delay the work of co-workers, to make them look bad or slow them down, competing with co-workers to gain status and recognition and giving co-workers incorrect or even misleading information about a particular job.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Definition==
According to Duffy, Gangster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Ganster | first2 = D.C. | last3 = Pagon | first3 = M | year = 2002 | title = Social undermining in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 331–352 | doi=10.2307/3069350| jstor = 3069350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Social undermining has been very effective in the workplace.&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. [[social support]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Social undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depersonalization]], and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being.

Various different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors{{which|date=September 2015}} that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: "what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?" These studies' findings{{which|date=September 2015}} indicate that "this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient".&lt;ref name=folger1998&gt;Folger, R., &amp; Cropanzano, R. (1998). Organizational justice and human resource management. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=folger2001&gt;Folger, R., &amp; Cropanzano, R. (2001). Fairness theory: justice as accountability.

Social comparison and fairness: a counterfactual simulations perspective. In J. Suls &amp; L. Wheeler(Eds.), ''Handbook of social comparison: Theory and research'' (pp. 423–433). New York: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roese | first1 = N.

Behaviors of social undermining can affect a person and his or her perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gant |first1=LM |last2=Nagda |first2=BA |last3=Brabson |first3=HV |last4=Jayaratne |first4=S |last5=Chess |first5=WA |last6=Singh |first6=A |title=Effects of social support and undermining on African American workers' perceptions of coworker and supervisor relationships and psychological well-being |journal=Social Work |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=158–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8480245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998.&lt;ref name=folger1998/&gt; The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimatis, M., &amp; Wells, G. (1995). Individual differences in counter-factual thinking. In N. Roese &amp; J. Olson (Eds.), What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking (pp. 81–102). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling "singled out".

===Envy===
While social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about [[envy]]. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Abusive supervision===
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive [[Supervisor|supervision]] can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome" ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi=10.2307/1556375| jstor = 1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., &amp; Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J.

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref name=hoobler/&gt;

===Bottom-line mentality===
[[Bottom line]] is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt; Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Employees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Individual differences==

Research suggests that whether or not someone engages in [[social support]] or social undermining depends upon their own [[goal]]s. Those with [[compassionate]] goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Canevello | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Creating and undermining social support in communal relationships: The role of compassionate and self-image goals | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 555–575 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.555 | pmid=18729694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Research{{which|date=May 2015}} has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring.

Research by Joseph et al.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"/&gt; found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction.

A 2007 study conducted by Benyamini, Medalion and Garfinkel showed that support from a spouse while being seriously ill helped a person to cope with their illness.&lt;ref name=benyamini&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benyamini | first1 = Y. | last2 = Medalion | first2 = B. | last3 = Garfinkel | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Patient and spouse perceptions of the patient's heart disease and their associations with received and provided social support and undermining | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 765–785 | doi=10.1080/14768320601070639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study used patients who had heart disease. The intention of the study was to find if positive and negative interactions between the patients who have heart disease and their spouse can cause spouse support or spouse undermining. The researchers found that when the patient considered their illness as being negative (e.g., especially painful or likely to be chronic) they tended to want more support from the spouse and tended  to feel as if their spouse was not providing sufficient support. This could cause the patient to believe that they were experiencing social undermining. Other times, the partner's actions could cause the patient to feel as if the spouse was acting critical towards them. This could turn into social undermining, causing the spouse to think that the patient was not taking their condition seriously. When the spouse showed that the illness was serious, it could sometimes cause the spouse to become over-protective of the partner. This could also cause the spouse to be critical of their partner behavior, and the partner could provide less support for the patient. The results of the study were that when a spouse had negative views of the illness, he or she engaged in both more support and more undermining.&lt;ref name=benyamini/&gt;

Research conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} Vinokur &amp; Vinokur &amp; Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship.

Cranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="citation journal"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Nutrition and exercise===
Research has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine [[parenting styles]] in order to raise healthy children.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
Another study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior,  try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Market, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently.  Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackert | first1 = M. | last2 = Stanforth | first2 = D. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = A. A. | year = 2011 | title = Undermining of nutrition and exercise decisions: Experiencing negative social influence | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 402–410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Social undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350| citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support.

Vinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt; They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993)&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"/&gt;  found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.

The results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;

Another example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCaskill | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Lakey | first2 = B. | year = 2000 | title = Perceived support, social undermining, and emotion: Idiosyncratic and shared perspectives of adolescents and their families | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 820–832 | doi=10.1177/0146167200269007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002)&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"/&gt; found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.

Researchers found that in adolescent self-reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions  of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is.&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

Due to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

==Emotional and behavioral reactions==
Research has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased [[Counterproductive work behavior|counterproductive behaviors]], reciprocated social undermining, and decreased [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crossley | first1 = C. D. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional and behavioral reactions to social undermining: A closer look at perceived offender motives | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=managementfacpub| journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 14–24 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased [[self-esteem]] and even [[psychosomatic]] symptoms.

In a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009" /&gt; found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender.

[[Posttraumatic embitterment disorder|Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder]] can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.

The '''Société des Artistes Indépendants''' (''Society of Independent Artists''), '''Salon des Indépendants''' was formed in [[Paris]] on 29 July 1884. The association began with the organization of massive exhibitions in Paris, choosing the slogan "''sans jury ni récompense''" ("without jury nor reward"). [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the [[Salon d'Automne]]. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. [[World War I]] brought a closure to the salon, though the ''Artistes Indépendants'' remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters is located in the vast basements of the [[Grand Palais]] (next door to the ''[[Société des Artistes Français]]'', the ''[[Société Nationale des Beaux Arts|Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]'', the [[Salon d'Automne|Société du Salon d'Automne]], and others).

==History==
[[Image:Signac - Portrait de Félix Fénéon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Signac]], 1890, ''Portrait of [[Félix Fénéon]], Opus 217. Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 92.5 cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City]]]]
The '''Salon des Indépendants''' (Salon des Artistes Indépendants) is an annual independent art exhibition aimed at a large audience that takes place in Paris. It was established in response to the rigid traditionalism of the official government-sponsored Salon. Since the first exhibition of 1884, at the Pavilion de la ville de Paris ([[Champs-Élysées]]), the organizing Société des Artistes Indépendants has vowed to bring together the works of artists claiming a certain independence in their art. The event is characterized by the absence of both awards and a selection jury. There are however placement or hanging committees. In contrast to the [[Salon d'Automne]], which takes place in Paris during autumn months, the Indépendants is held during the springtime, inspiring artistic production during winter months, as artists prepare for the show. Several important dates have marked the history of the salon.

During the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], artists not backed by the official ''[[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]]'' in charge of the exhibits at the annual ''Salon'' or without support supplied by actual political constellations had little chance to advance. From year to year the number of artists working in Paris, the number of artists submitting works to the official ''[[Paris Salon|Salon]]'' and the number of works refused by the jury increased, but neither the Second Empire nor the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] found an answer to this situation.

For years, the artists had counted on official support. In 1884, finally, the artists began to organise themselves, and a "''Group of independent artists''" was authorised by the Ministry of Fine Arts to arrange an exhibition, while the City of Paris agreed to supply rooms for the presentation. So, from May 15 through July 15, the first "free" exhibition of contemporary art showed more than 5000 works by more than 400 artists.

Although sustained by Mesureur, deputy chairman of the Council of Paris and [[Grandmaster (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Lodge]] of France, by Frédéric Hattat, chairman of the Fine Art commission in the same council, by Albert Dubois-Pillet, commanding the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]], member of the [[Grand Orient de France]], the beginning of the Company, considered as a nest of [[revolutionaries]], were difficult.

===Establishment===
June 11, 1884, Maître Coursault, notary at [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], officially confirmed the establishment of the ''Société''

Article 1 of the organization's statutes reads,
:...the purpose of ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' – based on the principle of abolishing admission jury – is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom.

===Groupe vs. Société===
Members of the ''Groupe'' challenged this foundation and succeeded to have an exhibition arranged "for the victims of the recent [[cholera]] epidemic", inaugurated December 1, 1884, by Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council. But financially the result was a catastrophe. Nevertheless, in spring 1885, the "Groupe" organised its next exhibition, this time with some success.

==Early exhibitions==

The Salon des Indépendants arose through the need by artists to present their works to the general public independently, rather than through the official selective method of the "Salon" (created by [[Louis XIV]]).&lt;ref name="Indépendants"&gt;[http://www.artistes-independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&amp;chlangue=us Société des Artistes Indépendants, History]&lt;/ref&gt; A small collective of innovative artists—[[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Camille Pissarro]] along with [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]]—created the Salon des Indépendants. The right to present their works to the public with no restrictions was their only condition. Article no. 1 of the By-laws of the organization: "The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom".&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;

On 1 December 1884, Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council, opened the first Salon des Artistes Indépendants at the Palais Polychrome (near the Palais de l'Industrie). The Salon became the refuge for artworks deemed unacceptable by the traditional Salon. Among the works exhibited were Seurat's "[[Bathers at Asnières|La baignade à Asnières]]" Signac's "Le Pont d'Austerlitz", and works of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Armand Guillaumin]], [[Charles Angrand]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/salon%20des%20Indépendants Salon des Indépendants, Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proceeds of the first show were earmarked for the victims of [[cholera]]. The second exhibition was held in 1886 in a temporary building in the [[Tuileries Garden]] with 200 paintings exhibited. By 1905 [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Henri Matisse]] had exhibited there.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; During the period between 1890 and 1914 known as ''La [[Belle Époque]]'' practically all of the artists associated with [[modernism]] and the [[avant-garde]] exhibited at the Indépendants. The works exhibited ranged in style from [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] to [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]], [[Les Nabis|Nabis]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-impressionist]]/[[Divisionism|Divisionist]], [[Fauvism|Fauve]], [[Expressionism|Expressionist]], [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]].

The submission payment was 10 francs for four works. In 1906 ten works could be submitted for 25 francs and from 1909 only two. In 1901 more than thousand paintings were shown. 2,395 works were exhibited in 1904, and 1905, 4,269 works by 669 artists. By 1908 six thousand works were displayed at the Indépendants. In 1910 the number of artists increased to 1,182, rising progressively to 2,175 by 1930. In 1926 the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] estimated that only 100 of the 3,726 artworks were of any value.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 and 1897 the Salon des Indépendants was held at the [[:fr:Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux|Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux]] ([[Champ de Mars]]). Between 1901 and 1907, the exhibition was held in the Grandes Serres de la Ville de Paris (Cours-la-Reine, Paris), also called ''Grande Serre de l'Alma'', built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900. From 1920 the exhibitions were held at the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In 1902 the Indépendants featured a retrospective of works by Toulouse-Lautrec. [[Jean Metzinger]] sent three paintings to the Salon des Indépendants in 1903, and subsequently moved to Paris with the proceeds from their sale. He again exhibiting several paintings, this time along with [[Robert Delaunay]], at the Indépendants of 1904, where Cross presented his Venice series. In 1905 the salon featured retrospectives of works by Seurat and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1905 Fauvism==
From 24 March to 30 April, the burgeoning of Fauvism was visible at the Indépendants, prior to the infamous Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905 which historically marks the birth of the term Fauvism, after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

At the 1905 Indépendants [[Henri Matisse]] exhibited with [[Albert Marquet]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Charles Camoin]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue"&gt;[http://cdm16028.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16028coll4/id/4116/rec/100 Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 21ème exposition, 1905, Digital collection: Rare Books in the Thomas J. Watson Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)]&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition was reviewed by Vauxcelles in [[Gil Blas]] on 4, 18 and 23 March 1905.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T. Clement, ''Les Fauves: A Sourcebook'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994] {{ISBN|0-313-28333-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]''. In the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique and brightly colored, it was painted in 1904, after a summer spent working in [[St. Tropez]] on the [[French Riviera]] alongside the [[neo-Impressionism|neo-Impressionist]] painters [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council et al. 1966, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had first adopted after reading Signac's essay, "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme" in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, "Henri Matisse"&lt;/ref&gt; Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants.

Matisse is in charge of the hanging committee, assisted by Metzinger, Bonnard, Camoin, Laprade Luce, Manguin, Marquet, Puy and Vallotton.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==1906, all the Fauves==
[[File:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], 1905-06, ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', oil on canvas, 175 x 241 cm (69 × 95 in), [[Barnes Foundation]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]
At the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.

According to Metzinger's memoirs, it was at the 1906 Salon des Indépendants that he met [[Albert Gleizes]] and visited his studio in Courbevoie several days later. In 1907, at Max Jacob's place, Metzinger met Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger had acquired enough prestige to be elected to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants, in addition to his entry of eight works.&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue" /&gt; He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by one critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907, the wholesale transformation==
In the spring of 1906 [[Georges Braque]] exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1907, held from 20 March to 30 April, six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased directly at the Salon des Indépendants by the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde for a total price of 505 FF. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to [[Picasso]] by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braque's works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L’Estaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415082615/http://www.moma.org/m/explore/collection/art_terms/744/0/1.iphone_ajax?klass=artist Lewis Kachur, ''Georges Braque'', MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[André Derain]] exhibited his ''Dancer at Le Rat Mort'', painted during the winter of 1906, and his large ''Bathers'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], New York) of early 1907. No longer truly Fauve, this work is close to Cézanne in its angular form and tonal modeling.

[[File:Matisse Souvenir de Biskra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], 1907, ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'', oil on canvas. 92 x 140 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]]]
Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' also appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees... This is an artistic effect tending toward the abstract that escapes me completely. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Blue Nude'' would later create a sensation at the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/11/the-response-to-matisses-blue-nude/ Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes, ''The Response to Matisse's Blue Nude'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, and Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1907, Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatique, oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1907, ''[[Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques]]'', oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

==1908, barbarous schematizers==
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, Holland]]

Signac becomes president of the 24th Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1908, held 20 March through 2 May, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908) Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original effort presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'... who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

In excess of 1,314 artists exhibit 6,701 works. Matisse does not submit any works.

After this salon, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record'', May 1910, at the heart of the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1909, simplified forms==
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that one of the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). On 25 March 1909, Louis Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque (Bracke, sic) exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The evolution towards a more linear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910, ignorant geometers==
[[File:Henri Rousseau - Le Rêve - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Rousseau]] (Le Douanier), 1910, ''[[The Dream (Rousseau painting)|The Dream]]'', [[MoMA]]. Exhibited at the 1910 Indépendants a few months before his death]]
Gleizes exhibits in the Salon des Indépendants for the first time: ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the 'first Cubist portrait'. Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), that Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900-1930, International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gleizes's memoirs, [[Alexandre Mercereau]] introduces him to Metzinger, but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

[[File:Boronali Impression.jpg|right|thumb|[[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], 1910, ''Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique'', oil on canvas, 54 x 80 cm, painted by the donkey Lolo. Exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants, 1910]]
Apollinaire wrote in the daily newspaper ''L'Intransigeant'', which had a circulation of about 50,000, about the exhibition that consisted of close to 6000 paintings.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1910, Lolo the donkey===
Remarkably, even the presence of a painting made by a donkey named Lolo passed by practically unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; The painting was entitled ''[[:fr:Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique|Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique]]'' presented by the artist [[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], the 'excessivist' from Genoa was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants. Boronali was in fact the Parisian donkey (Lolo), who made the painting with his tail. (Cf. Warnod, 1910; Weiss, 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–151, 304.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://radicalart.info/process/vibration/animal/index.html The Mechanics of Expression: Donkeys, Humans, Monkeys, Cats and Elephants]&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that Lolo belonged to Frédéric Gérard ([[Lapin Agile#Le Lapin Agile à l'époque de Frédéric Gérard|« le père Frédé »]]), owner of the cabaret [[Lapin Agile]] in la butte [[Montmartre]]. [[Roland Dorgelès]] and two friends, [[:fr:André Warnod|André Warnod]] et [[Jules Depaquit]], attached a paint brush to the tail of the animal. The donkey did the rest. The painting sold for 400FF (equal to 1,257 Euros today&lt;ref&gt;[http://smariano.club.fr/pages/divers/conver-franc.htm Conversion table]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was donated by Dorgelès to the ''Orphelinat des Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Groinowski, ''Aux commencements du rire moderne. L'esprit fumiste'', [[José Corti]], Paris, 1997, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting forms part of the permanent collection at ''l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu'' ([[Milly-la-Forêt]]).

The newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasise a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants ensuring that the works of painters now dubbed 'Cubists' would be shown together. Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown together in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The result of the group show is a major scandal. Even though the pictures shown are still conventional representations that generally observe the rules of classical perspective (according to Gleizes), the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), this is the first time the use of the term becomes widespread.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The term 'Cubism' is employed in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, and Le Fauconnier. During the summer, Gleizes is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Both are discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They have long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agree that traditional painting gives a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Another Cubist scandal is produced several months later at the Salon d'Automne, where the Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In the spring of 1911 the cubists made sure they were shown together, infiltrating the placement committee. That Le Fauconnier was the secretary of the salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works in alphabetical order of the artists names. In room 41 hung works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

This exhibition involved more than 6,400 paintings. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, and Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1912, the scandal continues==

The Salon des Indépendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive exhibition occurred exactly one year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris. Its wide-ranging repercussions were felt in Germany, Holland, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in ''Salle XI'' where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the [[Chambre des députés]] and was debated at the ''Assemblée Nationale''. At stake was more than just the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no. XXII -1 (2007), Guerre et statistiques, ''L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française''] (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, Léger, Metzinger and Archipenko formed the core of the hanging committee at the 1912 Indépendants. The common hall, room 20, in which the Cubists placed themselves became the nucleus of the exhibition.c&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

At the 1912 Salon des Indépendants Albert Gleizes exhibited ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was withdrawn prior to the exhibition — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]]'s reviewed the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in the March–April 1912 issue of La Revue de France et des Pays, noting Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'matière'. [[André Salmon]] too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in ''La Femme au Cheval'' and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm0CrcbXtN&amp;sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=horse&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories''], Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes, on the other hand, would write in 1913 of the Cubist movements continual evolution:
{{quote|The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P."&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And regarding the reception received by the Cubists at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne Gleizes writes:

{{quote|Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent", writes Albert Gleizes, "Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;}}

==1913, the peak of Cubism==
[[File:Juan Gris - Man in a Café.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Gris]], 1912, ''Man in a Café'', oil on canvas, 127.6 x 88.3 cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at the 1913 Salon des Indépendants.]]
The Salon des Indépendants was held March 9 through 18 May, the Cubist works were shown in room 46. [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited his large ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' — [[Albert Gleizes]], Albert Gleizes. ''Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — [[Robert Delaunay]] ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.

In room 45 hung the works of [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[František Kupka]], [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Macdonald-Wright]]. This was the first exhibition where [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Synchromism]] were emphatically present. Apollinaire in ''L'Intransigeant'' mentioned la Salle hollandaise (room 43), which included Jacoba van Heemskerck, [[Piet Mondrian]], Otto van Rees, [[Jan Sluyters]] en [[Leo Gestel]] and Lodewijk Schelfhout.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1914, Orphism==
The 1914 exhibition, held from 1 March to 30 April, was composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor: Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] were largely represented.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1915-1919==
During the First World War there were no exhibitions. After the war, however, there was a revival of Cubism, led by Gleizes and others, which included exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s ''Galerie l'Effort Moderne'' and a revival of the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1920, the emergence of Dada==
In an attempt to regain their pre-war status at the forefront of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by [[Dada]], the cubists regrouped.&lt;ref name="Witham"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6xkkSVZz_OYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=picasso+Salon+des+Indépendants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nD60pJBckp&amp;sig=V_8efFBPfjIOb4oX5_BM_ATg_WA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UesTUeGrHIWq0QX004CYBA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picasso%20Salon%20des%20Indépendants&amp;f=false Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', University Press of New England (ebook) 2013], {{ISBN|978-1-61168-349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the [[Grand Palais]] des [[Champs-Elysées]]. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The most outrageous Dada eruption to date transpired at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. The Dadaist saw the Indépendants as decisive in the push to the top of the avant-garde food chain of the Parisian art scene. The plan was as cunning as it was devious: [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[André Breton]] rented an auditorium at the Grand Palais. A group guided by Tzara distributed flyers and posters saying that [[Charlie Chaplin]] would appear "in the flesh" on February 5. The crowd heckled when Chaplin (not even aware of the event) never showed up, and Tzara was ready: his group hurled insults back at the crowd from the stage.

The renown literary figure [[André Gide]] present in the audience, fooled as the others, described the happening: "Some young people, solemn, stilted, tied up in knots, got up on the platform and as a chorus declaimed insincere inanities".&lt;ref name="Witham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gide quoted in Wayne Andrews, ''The Surrealist Parade'', New York: New Directions, 1990, p. 40, in Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive event witnessed by the more respectable Cubists solicited a vehement denunciation, declaring Dada an abomination.

==1921, a new epoch==
The Salon des Indépendants of 1921, which opened in January, had less Cubist paintings than the previous year. Braque and Metzinger were not represented. The artists that did exhibit included Gleizes, Ferat, Hayden, Marcoussis, Hellesen and Survage. With the Cubists were also [[Hélène Pordriat]], [[Marthe Laurens]], [[Irène Lagut]], [[Alice Halicka]] and [[Sonia Lewitska]]. At the exhibition were also the works of Bissière, Blanchard, [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[André Lhote|Lhote]], [[Henriette Tirman|Tirman]], Zadkine and Lipchitz.

The hanging commission was conducted in opposition to Signac, who was in favor of the alphabetical order system. Léger left the placement committee in 1923. In 1924 placement was classified by nationality and alphabetically. Lhote left the placement committee, which consisted of 20 people, along with eight other members in 1925. Lhote was of the opinion that the change was mainly intended for the "Sunday painters". Signac and his supporters defended the alphabetical order stressing 'equal attention to all participants' and that there was no place for 'les petites chapelles' (the little chapels). The latter was especially directed against the neo-cubists, who after the First World wished to be associated with well-known artists.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

From 1920 the ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' obtained the Grand Palais for its salon exhibitions. After World War II, the ''Salon des Indépendants'' was renewed with the artist group ''[[:fr:Jeune création|Jeune création]]'', with the assistance of Dunoyer de Segonzac, [[Bernard Buffet]], [[Jean Carzou]], [[Maurice Boitel]], Yves Brayer, Aristide Caillaud, [[Daniel du Janerand]], amongst others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">The '''Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory''' (SABO) is a nonprofit membership-supported scientific and educational organization founded in 1996 in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], [[Arizona]], USA.  The mission of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory is to promote the conservation of the birds of southeastern Arizona, their habitats, and the diversity of species that share those habitats through research, monitoring, and public education.  

The observatory's founders and current directors are Tom Wood and Sheri Williamson, former managers of [[The Nature Conservancy]]'s [[Ramsey Canyon Preserve]], and Mark Newstrom.

==Monitoring bird diversity==

Southeastern Arizona is at a biogeographic crossroads, where the [[Rocky Mountains]] meet the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of [[Mexico]] and the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] blends into the [[Sonoran Desert]].  Isolated mountain ranges known as "[[sky islands]]" are home to a variety of animal and plant species found nowhere else in the [[United States]].  The [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] flows north from the mountains of northern [[Sonora]], Mexico providing a highway for millions of migrating birds every spring and fall.  The [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and [[Sonoita Creek]] also provide [[riparian]] habitat for breeding and migrating birds and other wildlife.  Much of the best remaining wildlife habitat in the region is in the [[Coronado National Forest]], national and state parks, national wildlife refuges and conservation areas, state wildlife areas, military reservations, and [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] preserves. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory has conducted various monitoring projects both independently and in cooperation with public agencies.  Its longest-running research project, in cooperation with the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]] and Friends of the San Pedro River, is a study of the [[hummingbird]]s that use the [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] as a migratory corridor or breeding area.&lt;ref name="band1"&gt;City of Sierra Vista, AZ YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VXtUC3J0Jw Hummingbird Banding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="band2"&gt;Davis, Tony.

==Ecotourism and outreach==

Southeastern Arizona consistently ranks as one of the top five [[birding]] locations in the United States. Tens of thousands of birders visit the area each year, making [[Ecotourism|nature-based tourism]] an important asset to the regional economy.  The area's natural attractions also lure active retirees and others interested in relocating to areas with diverse opportunities for outdoor recreation.  To cultivate environmental awareness and advocacy among both residents and tourists, the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory offers bird walks, workshops, other educational activities in both Arizona and northwestern Mexico,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Wilcove, David S. [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/NetCommunity/LbPrintPage.aspx?print=725 "Border Traffic: The challenge of saving Mexico’s vanishing Thick-billed Parrots"]. ''Living Bird'', [[Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology]], Winter 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and volunteer opportunities. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory also supports community-based outreach and economic development programs such as the Southwest Wings [[Birding]] and Nature Festival, the Wings Over [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]] [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Crane]] Celebration, and the Southeastern Arizona Birding Trail.

'''The Cloisters''' in [[Letchworth Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was built in 1905 as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]] and where students were taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. After a period of neglect during [[World War II]] The Cloisters became the North Hertfordshire Masonic Centre in 1951.

==Annie Jane Lawrence==
[[File:Annie Jane Lawrence 1910.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Annie Jane Lawrence c1910]]
The Cloisters was built by [[Quaker]] Miss Annie Jane Lawrence (16 April 1863&amp;ndash;3 August 1953), the daughter of Alfred Lawrence (1826 - 1875), who, with his brother Frederick, owned 'Lawrence Brothers, Smiths and Founders', and his wife Mary Elizabeth (née Ridge, 1838-1903).&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;Miles, V.W., ''The Cloisters, Letchworth, 1907-1967'' Published by The Lawrence Cloisters Trust (1967) pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather William Lawrence (1789-1855) came from humble origins but went on to be elected Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]] in 1848 and an Alderman of the [[City of London]], while her uncle [[Sir James Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir James Lawrence]] was [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1868. Her younger brother was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence]] (1871-1961).&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://thecloisters.org.uk/About.aspx About The Cloisters - A Brief History - The Cloisters, Letchworth website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 she was a pupil at the School for Ladies in [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], while in 1895 she visited Boston in the USA.&lt;ref name=Ancestry/&gt; 

As a young woman she undertook social work in the slums of London, which urged her on to action. Lawrence decided to build a centre dedicated as a school of thought from which adults could go out and effect social change. She chose Letchworth because it was the world's First Garden City; here she leased three acres of land on which she built The Cloisters and Cloisters Lodge, intending that the former should be a School of Philosophy while she lived in the latter.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Design==
The design reputedly came to Miss Lawrence in a dream. The building originally consisted of a large half-oval 'open-air room' called the `Cloisters Garth' with an open colonnade to the south and large glazed bays to the north; this was flanked by two wings, one housing the kitchen and store rooms and the other the cubicles and dressing rooms for an oval open-air swimming pool. It was designed according to the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, and was built using [[marble]]s and other materials from all over [[Europe]].

==1905-1907==
Originally built as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]], with accommodation for 20 students, students were encouraged to study "how thought affects action and what causes and produces thought." Through healthy outdoor living it was intended that the students would develop healthy minds. The building was also designed to hold lectures, conferences, drama and musical performances as well as organ recitals. Students were also taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;

Designed by [[architect]] [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], building commenced on the {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in 1905, and the building opened on 17 January 1907, having cost the then huge sum of £20,000. Miss Lawrence built a house for herself, 'Cloisters Lodge', alongside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Cloisters.htm Utopia Britannica - British Utopian Experiments 1325 - 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907-1939==
[[File:cloisters1908.jpg|The Cloisters in 1908|thumb|right]]
A small community developed at ''The Cloisters'' dedicated to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. It became the base for the ''Alpha Union'' set up by J. Bruce Wallace of the Brotherhood Church, who organised summer schools and residential courses there. Miss Lawrence, although somewhat deaf, was a great music lover. On one occasion she brought The London Concert Orchestra, made up of 40 unemployed musicians, to play at the Cloisters Garth. This was part of an ongoing series of concerts that she organised attended by audiences of 1,000, making organ recitals, band and choral concerts a regular part of the new town's cultural life. The last concert was given by the Brotherhood Orchestra in 1939 on the day the [[Second World War]] broke out.

== History since 1939==
[[File:Cloistersletchworth1b.JPG|thumb|right|The Masonic Temple at The Cloisters]]
The Cloisters was commandeered by the Army during the [[Second World War]] and suffered damage. By 1948 Miss Lawrence found it increasingly difficult to maintain the building and to repair the damage caused by the Army. She initially offered it to the local Council, who turned it down. Eventually, she offered it to the local [[Freemasons]] who accepted it, turning it into the [[North Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Centre. About sixty [[Masonic lodges]] and 'side degrees' meet at The Cloisters, and the centre is run and maintained by an elected Board of Trustees, The Lawrence Cloisters Trust. A Craft Lodge, the 'Cloisters Lodge No 7100' was formed there in 1951 to commemorate Miss Lawrence's generous gift of the building to [[Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Jack ''The Cloisters, Letchworth'' in ''Freemasonry Today'' Issue 11 (Winter 1999/2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16291128?versionId=19104779 Christodoulou, Glenn ''The Cloisters Lodge: the Next Twenty-Five Years'' Privately printed  by the Cloisters Lodge No. 7100 Festival Committee  (2001) [[National Library of Australia]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Lawrence eventually moved out of Cloisters Lodge into a house on Willian Way in Letchworth but her increasing frailty led to her moving to St Catherine's Nursing Home where she died aged 90 on 3 August 1953.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; She is buried in the churchyard of [[Church of All Saints, Willian|All Saints Church]] in [[Willian, Hertfordshire|Willian]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. In her will she left £41,246 2s 6d to George Ernest Hinman (Solicitor) and her brother the Rt. Hon. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;[http://person.ancestry.co.uk/tree/87123076/person/80019953384/facts Annie Jane Lawrence - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cloisters has been designated by Letchworth Garden City Corporation as one of the 'great historic buildings' of [[North Hertfordshire]]. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1102019|desc=The Cloisters|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 The Cloisters appeared in episode 4 of [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s five-part series ''Britain's Secret Homes'', placing it in 16th place out of 50 historic buildings in Britain selected by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/britains-secret-homes/episode-4/ 'Britain's Secret Homes: Episode 4' on the '[[English Heritage]]'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although structurally sound, in October 2013 the building was put on [[English Heritage]]'s 'At Risk Register' owing mainly to the poor condition of its roof tiles which have allowed water to cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical building 'at risk' says English Heritage' - 'HItchin, Letchworth &amp; Baldock Advertiser'' October 16, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Cloisters on at risk register' - ''The Hitchin Comet'' October 17, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Institute for Bird Populations''', based in Marin County, California, is a non-profit organization dedicated to studying and monitoring bird populations, and providing land managers and policy makers with information needed to better manage those populations.

== History ==

The Institute was founded in 1989 by President Dr. David DeSante to develop and coordinate the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship Program (MAPS), a network of approximately 500 standardized bird banding stations studying breeding bird populations across North America.

In June 2015, the Institute launched a website, the Vital Rates of North American Landbirds, tracking the population of 150 bird species in North America, to raise awareness about the population declines of those species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/pets/ct-pets-briefs-0623-20150624-story.html|title=Birds, birds and more birds|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=24 June 2015|author=William Hageman|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Scientists at the institute develop standardized bird monitoring techniques and tools for land managers and researchers studying bird populations, coordinate large-scale networks for monitoring vital rates of birds, conduct original research on the abundance, distribution, and ecology of birds, and convey their findings in scientific papers and reports to public and private land managers.  The Institute also trains individuals, organizations, and agencies in the United States and abroad, in effective bird monitoring techniques.

== Initiatives ==

* Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship Program (MAPS)
* Monitoreo de Sobreviviencia Invernal Program (MoSI): a cooperative effort among agencies, organizations, and individual bird-banders in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to monitor overwintering survival rates of both Neotropical migratory and resident bird species
* Research and conservation efforts on behalf of birds in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains (IBP's Sierra Nevada Bird Observatory)
* Development and deployment of bird monitoring programs on public lands
* Publication of ''Bird Populations'', an online, peer-reviewed journal of global avian research
* 2015 : Bird Genoscape Project, led by [[UCLA]], first maps identifying the population-specific migration paths of several bird species to fix conservation priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/uclas-bird-genoscape-project-to-aid-conservation-efforts-for-north-american-birds-threatened-by-climate-change|title=UCLA’s Bird Genoscape Project to aid conservation efforts for North American birds threatened by climate change|website=Ucla.edu|date=16 September 2015|author=Alison Hewitt|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CavalerulTracBulgariaMadara.jpg|thumb|Fragment from a Thracian horseman marble relief: the hunting dog attacking the boar]]
The '''Thracian horseman''' (also   "Thracian Rider" or "Thracian Heros") is the name given to a recurring motif of a  horseman depicted in [[relief]]s of the  [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods in the [[Balkans]]  ([[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios C. Samsaris, Le culte du Cavalier thrace dans la vallée du Bas-Strymon  à l' époque romaine (Recherches sur la localisation de ses sanctuaires), "Dritter Internationaler Thrakologischer Kongress (Wien, 2-6 juni 1980)", Bd. II, Sofia 1984, p. 284 sqq. - Dimitrios C. Samsaris, Le culte du Cavalier thrace dans la colonie romaine de Philippes et dans son territoire, "Ponto-Baltica" 2-3(1982-83)89-100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moesia]], roughly from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD).

Its depiction is in the tradition of the funerary steles of [[Roman cavalry]]men, with the addition of syncretistic elements from Hellenistic and  [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkanic]]  religious or mythological tradition.
The Thracian horseman is  depicted as a hunter on horseback, riding from left to right. Between the horse's hooves is depicted either a [[hunting dog]] or  a boar. In some instances, the dog is replaced by a lion.

Inscriptions found in Romania identify the horseman as '''''Heros''''' (also ''Eros, Eron, Herros, Herron''), apparently the word ''[[Greek hero cult|heros]]'' used as a proper name.&lt;ref&gt;Nubar Hampartumian, ''Moesia Inferior (Romanian Section) and Dacia'', Volume 74, Part 4 (1979), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=kdIUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cult of the Thracian horseman was especially important in [[Philippi]], where the Heros had the epithets of [[soter]] (saviour) and ''epekoos'' "answerer of prayers". Funerary stelae depicting the horseman belong to the middle or lower classes (while the upper classes preferred the depiction of banquet scenes).&lt;ref&gt;
Richard S. Ascough, ''Paul's Macedonian Associations: The Social Context of Philippians and 1 Thessalonians'' (2003), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=SXNtJ2A7dC8C&amp;pg=PA159  p. 159].&lt;/ref&gt;
The motif most likely represents a composite figure, a [[Thracians|Thracian]] heroes  possibly based on [[Rhesus of Thrace|Rhesus]], the Thracian king mentioned in the Iliad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca West|title=Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utUksPa017QC&amp;pg=PT455|date=21 December 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0746-8|page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which [[Scythians|Scythian]], [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenistic]] and possibly other elements had been added.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Hoddinott, ''Early Byzantine Churches in Macedonia &amp; Southern Serbia'', 1963, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=WoSuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 58&amp;ndash;62]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman era, the "Thracian horseman" iconography is further syncretised. The rider is now sometimes shown as approaching a tree entwined by a serpent, or as approaching a goddess. These motifs are partly of Greco-Roman and partly of possible Scythian origin.
The motif of a horseman with his right arm raised advancing towards a seated female figure  is related to Scythian iconographic tradition. It is frequently found in Bulgaria, associated with [[Asclepius]] and [[Hygeia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott (1963:58)&lt;/ref&gt;
The motif of a standing goddess flanked by two horsemen, identified as [[Artemis]] flanked by the [[Dioscuri]], and a tree entwined by a serpent flanked by the Dioscuri on horseback is transformed into a motif of a ''single'' horseman approaching the goddess or the tree.
&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott (1963:59)&lt;/ref&gt;
Related to the Dioscuri motif is the so-called "Danubian Horsemen" motif of  two horsemen flanking standing goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott (1963:59)&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif of the Thracian horseman is not to be confused with the depiction of a rider slaying a barbarian enemy on funerary stelae, as on the stele of Dexileos, interpreted as depictions of a heroic episode from the life of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott (1963:60)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Roman Emperor [[Gordian III]] the god on horseback appears on coins minted at Tlos, in neighboring Lycia, and at Istrus, in the province of Lower Moesia, between Thrace and the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mihalkam.ancients.info/giiilycia.html Sabazios on coins, illustrated in the M. Halkam collection.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif of the Thracian horseman was continued in Christianised form in the equestrian iconography of both [[Saint George and the Dragon|Saint George]] and [[Saint Demetrius]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott (1963:[https://books.google.ch/books?id=WoSuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 61]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">{{Distinguish|Units of measurement}}
In [[statistics]], a '''unit of observation''' is the unit described by the [[data]] that one analyzes. For example, in a study of the [[demand for money]], the unit of observation might be chosen as the individual, with different observations ('''data point'''s) for a given point in time differing as to which individual they refer to; or the unit of observation might be the country, with different observations differing only in regard to the country they refer to. A study may have a differing unit of observation and [[unit of analysis]]: for example, in [[community]] research, the [[research design]] may collect data at the individual level of observation but the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] might be at the neighborhood level, drawing conclusions on neighborhood characteristics from data collected from individuals. Together, the unit of observation and the [[unit of analysis|level of analysis]] define the [[Sample population|population]] of a research enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blalock |first=Hubert M., Jr. |year=1972 |title=Social Statistics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=0-07-005751-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data point==
A '''data point''' or '''observation''' is a set of one or more [[Level of measurement|measurement]]s on a single member of unit of observation. For example, in a study of the determinants of [[money demand]] with the [[unit of observation]] being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, and number of dependents. [[Statistical inference]] about the population would be conducted using a [[statistical sample]] consisting of various such data points.

In addition, in [[statistical graphics]], a "data point" may be an individual item with a statistical display; such points may relate to either a single member of a population or to a [[summary statistic]] calculated for a given subpopulation.

==Types of data==
The measurements contained a unit of observation are formally ''typed'', where here ''type'' is used in a way compatible with [[datatype]] in [[computing]]; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value from {yes, no}, an [[integer]] or [[real number]], the identity of some [[Category (mathematics)|category]], or some [[vector space|vector]] or [[Array data structure|array]]. 

The implication of ''point'' is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are [[data processing|processed numerically]] before that is done. In the context of [[statistical graphics]], measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single ''data point'' within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.

'''Water testing''' is a broad description for various procedures used to analyze [[water quality]]. Millions of water quality tests are carried out daily to fulfill regulatory requirements and to maintain safety.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water testing – pass or fail?|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/market-insight/water-testing-pass-or-fail.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing may be performed to evaluate:
* '''ambient or environmental water quality''' – the ability of a [[surface water]] body to support aquatic life as an [[ecosystem]]. ''See'' [[Environmental monitoring]], [[Freshwater environmental quality parameters]] and [[Bioindicator]].
* '''[[wastewater]]''' – characteristics of [[water pollution|polluted water]] (domestic [[sewage]] or [[industrial waste]]) before treatment or after treatment. ''See'' [[Environmental chemistry]] and [[Wastewater quality indicators]].
* '''"[[raw water]]" quality''' – characteristics of a water source prior to treatment for domestic consumption ([[drinking water]]). ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and specific tests such as [[turbidity]] and [[hard water]].
* '''"finished" water quality''' – water treated at a municipal [[water purification]] plant. ''See'' [[Bacteriological water analysis]] and [[:Category:Water quality indicators]].
* suitability of water for '''industrial uses''' such as laboratory, manufacturing or [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|equipment cooling]]. ''See'' [[purified water]].

==Government regulation==
Government regulations related to water testing and water quality for some major countries is given below.

===China===

====Ministry of Environmental Protection====
The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China is the nation's environmental protection department charged with the task of protecting China's air, water, and land from pollution and contamination. Directly under the State Council, it is empowered and required by law to implement environmental policies and enforce environmental laws and regulations. Complementing its regulatory role, it funds and organizes research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP Mission|url=http://english.mep.gov.cn/About_SEPA/Mission/200803/t20080318_119444.htm|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China]].

====Regulatory challenges and debates====
In late 2009, a survey was carried out by China Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to assess the water quality of urban supplies in China's cities, which revealed that "at least 1,000" water treatment plants out of more than 4,000 plants surveyed at the county level and above failed to comply with government requirements. The survey results were never formally released to the public, but in 2012, China's Century Weekly published the leaked survey data. In response, Wang Xuening, a health ministry official, released figures derived from a pilot monitoring scheme in 2011 and suggested that 80% of China's urban tap water was up to standard.

China's new drinking water standards involve 106 indicators. Of China's 35 major cities, only 40% of cities have the capacity to test for all 106 indicators. The department in charge of local water and the health administration department will enter into a discussion to determine results for more than 60 of the new measures; hence it is not required to test the water using every indicator. The grading of water quality is based on an overall average of 95% to fulfill government requirements. The frequency of water quality inspections at water treatment plants is twice yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gong|first=Jing|title=What's coming out of China's taps?|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4962-What-s-coming-out-of-China-s-taps-|publisher=China Dialogue|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

====Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources====
Established in 1964, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources aims to conduct, organize, coordinate and promote research in all aspects of water resources. As a national research organization, it undertakes and promotes applied and basic research in different disciplines of water sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PCRWR|url=http://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/About.aspx|publisher=PCRWR|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====
In March 2013, Minister for Science and Technology Mir Changez Khan Jamali notified the National Assembly that groundwater samples collected revealed that only 15-18% samples were deemed safe for drinking both in urban and rural areas in Pakistan. The Ministry has created 24 Water Quality Testing Laboratories across Pakistan, developed and commercialized water quality test kits, water filters, water disinfection tablets and drinking water treatment sachets, conducted training for 2,660 professionals of water supply agencies and surveyed 10,000 water supply schemes out of a grand total of 12,000 schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 water quality testing laboratories set up in country: NA told|url=http://www.brecorder.com/pakistan/industries-a-sectors/110480-24-water-quality-testing-laboratories-set-up-in-country-na-told.html|publisher=Business Recorder|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Drinking Water Inspectorate====
The Drinking Water Inspectorate is a section of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set up to regulate the public water supply companies in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Inspectorate Home Page|url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water testing in England and Wales can be conducted at the environmental health office at the local authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking water quality|url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/drinking-water-quality/index.htm|publisher=DWI|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]].

===United States===

====Department of Homeland Security====
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States of America and U.S. territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. ''See'' [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 designates the Environmental Protection Agency as the sector-specific agency for the water sector's critical infrastructure protection activities.  All Environmental Protection Agency activities related to water security are carried out in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security. Possible threats to water quality include contamination with deadly agents, such as cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Testing and Treatment Reflect the Times|url=http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2004/05/water-testing-and-treatment-reflect-times|publisher=R&amp;D Magazine|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physical attacks like the release of toxic gaseous chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Sector: Critical Infrastructure|url=https://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|publisher=US DHS|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316071920/http://www.dhs.gov/water-sector|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Protection Agency====
The principal U.S. federal laws governing water testing are the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and the [[Clean Water Act]]. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issues regulations under each law specifying analytical test methods. EPA' s annual ''Regulatory Agenda'' sets a schedule for specific objectives on improving its oversight of water testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulatory Agendas and Regulatory Plans |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/regulatory-agendas-and-regulatory-plans |date=2017-05-31 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Drinking water analysis
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, [[public water system]]s are required to regularly monitor their treated water for contaminants. Water samples must be analyzed using EPA-approved testing methods, by laboratories that are certified by EPA or a state agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwanalyticalmethods/learn-about-drinking-water-analytical-methods |title=Learn about Drinking Water Analytical Methods |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/learn-about-laboratory-certification-drinking-water |title=Learn About Laboratory Certification for Drinking Water |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-10-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 revised total coliform rule and the 1989 total coliform rule are the only microbial drinking water regulations that apply to all public water systems. The revised rule highlights the frequency and timing of microbial testing by water systems based on population served, system type, and source water type. It also places a legal limit on the level for ''[[Escherichia coli]].'' Potential health threats must be disclosed to EPA or the appropriate state agency, and public notification is required in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revised Total Coliform  And Total Coliform Rule |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/revised-total-coliform-rule-and-total-coliform-rule |date=2017-02-24 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for measuring acute toxicity usually take between 24 and 96 hours to identify contaminants in water supplies.&lt;ref name="Performance Verification Testing"&gt;{{cite web |title=Performance Verification Testing |url=http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/watersecurity/upload/2004_04_01_watersecurity_fs_security_rapid-tox.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Wastewater analysis
All facilities in the United States that discharge wastewater to surface waters (e.g. rivers, lakes or coastal waters} must obtain a permit under the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]], a Clean Water Act program administered by EPA and state agencies. The facilities covered include sewage treatment plants, industrial and commercial plants, military bases and other facilities. Most permittees are required to regularly collect wastewater samples and analyze them for compliance with permit requirements, and report the results either to EPA or the state agency.&lt;ref name="NPDES basics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-07-24 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private wells====
Private wells are not regulated by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/privatewells |title=Private Drinking Water Wells |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-06-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, private well owners are responsible for testing their wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/testing.html |title=Well Testing |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010-05-03 |website=Private Wells |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state or local governments regulate well construction and may require well testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngwa.org/Professional-Resources/state-info/Pages/default.aspx |title=State Resources |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-12-19 |publisher=National Groundwater Association |location=Westerville, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regulatory challenges and debates====

=====Hydraulic fracturing=====
The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] created a loophole that exempts companies drilling for natural gas from disclosing the chemicals involved in fracturing operations that would normally be required under federal clean water laws. The loophole is commonly known as the "Halliburton loophole" because Dick Cheney, the former chief executive officer of Halliburton, was reportedly instrumental in its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorner |first=Joshua |title=Cheney's Culture of Deregulation and Corruption |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/06/cheney_deregulation.html |publisher=Center for American Progress |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Safe Drinking Water Act excludes [[hydraulic fracturing]] from the Underground Injection Control regulation in section 1421 (d)(1), the use of diesel fuel during hydraulic fracturing is still regulated. In addition, there may be additional regulations for hydraulic fracturing by state oil and gas agencies. States or EPA have the authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate discharge of produced waters from hydraulic fracturing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Under the Safe Drinking Water Act |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/groundwater/uic/class2/hydraulicfracturing/wells_hydroreg.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, federal environment officials scientifically linked underground water pollution with hydraulic fracturing for the first time in central Wyoming. EPA stated that the water supply contained at least 10 compounds known to be used in fracking fluids. The findings in the report contradicted arguments by the drilling industry on the safety of the fracturing process, such as the hydrologic pressure that naturally forces fluids downwards instead of upwards. EPA also commented that the pollution from 33 abandoned oil and gas waste pits were responsible for some degree of minor [[groundwater pollution]] in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lustgarten |first=Abrahm |title=Feds Link Water Contamination to Fracking for the First Time |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/feds-link-water-contamination-to-fracking-for-first-time |publisher=Pro Publica |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which is responsible for overseeing oil and gas production in Alaska, proposed new rules for regulating hydraulic fracturing in the state, which contains over two billion barrels of shale oil (second only to the Bakkan) and over 80 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Companies will be required to conduct water testing at least 90 days prior to and up to 120 days after hydraulically fracturing a well, which includes analysis of pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, and total petroleum hydrocarbons. The proposed rules necessitate disclosure of the identity and volume of chemicals used in fracturing fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Angelo |first=Wayne J. |title=Hydraulic fracturing: State Regulatory Roundup Vol. 14 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4023f7ca-2992-47a2-b644-b17805bffed5 |publisher=Kelley Drye &amp; Warren LLP|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission]].

In February 2013, the state of Illinois introduced the Illinois Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act, H.B. 2615, which imposes strict controls on fracturing companies, such as chemical disclosure requirements and water testing requirements. The bill includes baseline and periodic post-frack testing of potentially affected waters, such as surface water and groundwater sources near fracturing wells, to identify contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing wells will be closed if fracturing fluid is released outside of the shale rock formation being fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HB2615|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09800HB2615lv&amp;SessionID=85&amp;GA=98&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;DocNum=2615&amp;print=true|publisher=Illinois General Assembly|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pharmaceuticals and personal care products=====
Detectable levels of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in the parts per trillion, are found in many public drinking water systems in the US as many water treatment plants lack the technological know-how to remove these chemical compounds from raw water. There are now increasing worries about how these compounds degrade and react in the environment, during the treatment process, inside our bodies, and the long-term exposure to multiple contaminants at low levels. Out of over 80,000 chemicals registered with the EPA, the US federal drinking water rules mandate testing for only 83 chemicals, which calls for increased monitoring of pharmaceuticals on the presence and concentrations of chemical compounds in rivers, streams, and treated tap water. As traditional waste water regulations and treatment systems target microorganisms and nutrients, there are no federal standards for pharmaceuticals in drinking water or waste water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNabb|first=John|title=Testimony to Oversight Hearing|url=http://www.cleanwateraction.org/files/publications/ma/testimony-drugsinwater-mcnabb.pdf|publisher=Clean Water Action|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====
In May 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency released a new list of contaminants, known as the unregulated contaminant monitoring regulation 3 (UCMR3), that will be part of municipal water systems testing starting this year and continuing through 2015. The UCMR3 testing will help municipal water system operators measure the occurrence and exposure of contamination levels that may endanger human health. The State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa is the only state environmental public health laboratory that has been certified and approved to test for all 28 chemical contaminants on the new list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Pat|title=What's in your water?|url=http://now.uiowa.edu/2013/03/whats-your-water|publisher=Iowa Now|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rapid water quality test that provides accurate same day results of contamination levels, which marks a significant improvement from current tests that require at least 24 hours to obtain results. The new test will help authorities determine whether beaches are safe for swimming to keep the public from falling sick and could help prevent beaches from being closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Water Testing Could Prevent Beach Closures|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2013/03/20/new-water-testing-could-prevent-beach-closures.aspx|publisher=Environmental Protection|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The International Maritime Organization, known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization until 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IMO|url=http://www.imo.org/|publisher=IMO|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in Geneva in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Michael L|title=Ship Organization Nears Final Form; U.N. Maritime Body Expected to Have 3 Principal Organs – Panama in Opposition|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/03/04/archives/ship-organization-nears-final-form-un-maritime-body-expected-to.html?sq=international%2520maritime%2520organization&amp;scp=3&amp;st=cse|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=4 March 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force ten years later, meeting for the first time in 1959. ''See'' [[International Maritime Organization]].

The International Maritime Organization has been at the forefront of the international community by taking the lead in addressing the transfer of aquatic invasive species through shipping. On 13 February 2004, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments was adopted by consensus at a diplomatic conference held at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. According to the convention, all ships are required to implement a ballast water and sediments management plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Parties to the Convention are given the option to take additional measures which are subject to criteria set out in the Convention and to International Maritime Organization guidelines. Ballast water management is subjected to the ballast water exchange standard and the ballast water performance standard. Ships performing ballast water exchange shall do so with an efficiency of 95 per cent volumetric exchange of ballast water and ships using a ballast water management system (BWMS) shall meet a performance standard based on agreed numbers of organisms per unit of volume. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballast Water Management|url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/ballastwatermanagement/Pages/Default.aspx|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Ballast water discharge and the environment]].

==Water test initiatives==

===EarthEcho Water Challenge===
The [[World Water Monitoring Day|EarthEcho Water Challenge]] is an international education and outreach program that generates public awareness and involvement in safeguarding water resources globally by engaging citizens to conduct water testing of local water bodies. Participants learn how to conduct simple water quality tests, analyze common indicators of water health, specifically dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity. The program was originally called "World Water Monitoring Day" and later "World Water Monitoring Challenge", and was established in 2003. EarthEcho International encourages participants to conduct their monitoring activities as part of the "EarthEcho Water Challenge" during any period between March 22 ([[World Water Day]]) and December of each year.&lt;ref name="monitoring challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatermonitoringday.org |title=EarthEcho Water Challenge |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=EarthEcho International |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water test market==

===Market size and structure===
As of 2009, the global water test market, which includes in-house, small commercial and large laboratory groups, is approximately US$3.6 billion. The global market for low-end test equipment is roughly $300–400 million. The global market for in-line monitors is approximately $100–130 million.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"&gt;{{cite web|title=Something in the water|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/10/6/market-insight/something-water.html|publisher=Global Water Intelligence|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product offering===
Key products include analytical systems, instrumentation, and reagents for water quality and safety analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dray|first=Deane M.|title=Investing In The Global Water Sector|url=http://www.waterinnovations.org/PDF/presentations/Dray-0927p.pdf|publisher=Citi|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagents are chemical testing compounds that identify presence of chlorine, pH, alkalinity, turbidity and other metrics.

The equipment market comprises low-end, onsite field testing equipment, in-line monitors, and high-end testing laboratory instruments.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"/&gt; High-end lab equipment are [[Mass Spectrometry]] devices that conduct organic analysis, using [[Gas Chromatography]] and [[Liquid Chromatography]], or metals analysis, using Inductively Coupled Plasma.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

====New developments====
Several trends to monitor include digital sensor plug-and-play techniques and luminescent dissolved oxygen meters replacing sensors.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Sector Primer|url=http://www.fullermoney.com/content/2005-07-01/IainLittleGoldmanSachsWaterPrimer61505.pdf|publisher=Goldman Sachs|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Razor and Razor-blade" business model===
The water test market is approximately two-thirds equipment and one-third consumables. Reagents are used with each test and generate [[recurring revenue]] for companies. Aftermarket maintenance agreements, operator training and parts replacement help to ensure resources are maximized.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt; The market leader with an estimated 21% market share, Danaher, is able to reap EBIT{{clarify|what does EBIT mean?|date=November 2017}} margins in the high-teens-to-low-20% on test equipment, but can command 40%+ margins on the water test reagents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geraghty|first=Michael|title=Global Themes Strategy|url=http://fa.smithbarney.com/public/projectfiles/f8e732d5-6162-4cd9-8b1d-7b7317360163.pdf|publisher=Citi|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Freebie marketing]].

===Distribution===
Companies tend to employ the "direct-to-end-user" model for most products, but may also try to sell low-end equipment via the Internet to reduce distribution costs.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Pricing===
Pricing depends on application and type of product. Instruments range from as low as $10 to thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

===Suppliers===
The low-end test equipment is dominated by few large suppliers, notably Germany's Loviband and Merck, DelAgua Water Testing of the UK who work globally, and US-based LaMotte. Major manufacturers of in-line equipment include Siemens and Danaher's Hach. Thermo Scientific and Waters are key producers of high-end test equipment.&lt;ref name="Something in the water"/&gt;

===End markets===
The end markets include municipal water plants, industrial users, such as beverage and electronics, and environmental agencies, such as the United States Geological Survey.&lt;ref name="Water Sector Primer"/&gt;

==Water testing facilities==
There are two main types of laboratories: commercial and in-house.

===In-house laboratories===
In-house laboratories are usually present in municipal water and waste water facilities, breweries and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. They account for roughly half of all tests run annually.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

===Commercial laboratories===
Most of the commercial laboratories are single-site firms that only service institutions in the geographical region. The employee head count for each laboratory is usually fewer than five people, and revenues are under $1 million. These laboratories account for one quarter of all tests. There are several major laboratory groups, such as UK-based Inspicio and Australia-based ALS, which account for another quarter of all tests.&lt;ref name="Water testing – pass or fail"/&gt;

==Privatization==

===Opinion===
The conventional impression is that private water systems, which sources groundwater from rural areas, produce higher water quality compared to public water systems. Studies have demonstrated that groundwater is vulnerable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which necessitates frequent water testing. However, critics like Charrois argue that inconvenience and time constraint impede regular testing in private wells and water systems, which poses risk of poor water quality to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kruger|first=Sasha Nicole|title=A Blue Revolution: The Global Crisis of Water Quality and Accessibility|url=http://dc.cod.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&amp;context=essai|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sydney water crisis===
In 1998, Sydney, Australia's water supply, 85% controlled by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux until 2021,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Prospect Water Filtration Plant|url=http://www.degremont.com.au/projects/prospect-water-filtration-plant/|website=degremont.com.au|publisher=Suez Water and Treatment Solutions|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained high concentrations of parasites [[Giardia]] and [[Cryptosporidium]]. However, the public was not immediately informed of the water contamination when it had first occurred.&lt;ref name=MB&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Maude|title=Blue Gold|url=http://www.ratical.org/co-globalize/BlueGold.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See'' [[Suez (company)]] and [[1998 Sydney water crisis]].

===Ontario's Common Sense Revolution===
In Ontario, Canada, the Harris government introduced the "Common Sense Revolution" to cut the large provincial deficit accumulated under the previous Rae government, implementing major cuts to the environment budget, privatizing water testing labs, deregulating water protection infrastructure, and firing trained water testing experts. ''See'' [[Mike Harris]].

In 1999, in spite of a Canadian federal government study that found a third of Ontario's rural wells were contaminated with E. coli, the Ontario government dropped testing for E.coli from its Drinking Water Surveillance Program and subsequently closed the program in 2000. In June 2000, there was a wave of E. coli outbreaks in several communities in rural Ontario, where at least seven people died from consuming the water in Walkerton. The private testing company, A&amp;L Laboratories, detected E. coli in the water but failed to disclose the contamination to provincial authorities due to a loophole in the "common sense" regulation. A&amp;L Laboratories claimed that the test results were "confidential intellectual property" and therefore belonged only to the "client", who was the authorities of Walkerton who lacked the training for proper assessment.&lt;ref name=MB/&gt; ''See'' [[Escherichia coli]].

==Recent news==

===Water poisoning cases===
In 2011, Hong Kong Education Secretary Michael Suen was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease. The bacteria contamination stemmed from Hong Kong's HK$5.5 billion government headquarters site, where traces of the bacteria were found to be up to 14 times above acceptable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legionnaires' disease found at HK government complex|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16388832|accessdate=20 March 2013 | work=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water contamination cases===
In March 2013, French consumer magazine 60 Millions de Consommateurs and [[non-governmental organization]] Fondation France Libertés conducted an investigation that found traces of pesticides and prescription drugs, including a medicine for breast cancer treatment, in almost one in five French brands of bottled water, which are commonly touted as cleaner, healthier and purer alternatives to French tap water. Out of 47 brands of bottled water commonly available in French supermarkets, 10 brands contained "residues from drugs or pesticides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willsher|first=Kim|title=One in five French bottled waters 'contain drugs or pesticides'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/25/french-bottled-waters-contaminated-brands|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 March 2013|location=London|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, almost 200 water fountains in Jersey City public schools were found to contain lead above regulatory standards, where one of the water fountains had lead contamination at levels more than 800 times the EPA's standard. The situation warrants concern because exposure to lead in water could lead to [[mental retardation]] for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Terrence T.|title=Nearly 200 water fountains in Jersey City schools contain lead above fed standards|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/03/nearly_200_water_fountains_in.html|publisher=The Jersey Journal|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases===
In March 2013, a defense lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss charges against the owner of Mississippi Environmental Analytical Laboratories Inc. accused of falsifying records on industrial waste water samples. According to the indictment, Borg Warner Emissions Systems Inc. hired Tennie White, the owner of the laboratory, to test waste water discharge at its car parts plant in Water Valley. White is accused of creating three reports in 2009 that indicated tests were completed when they were not. The motion to dismiss was based on the lawyer's argument that the documents referred to in the indictment were not signed and were not submitted to a government agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer wants dismissal charges over water tests|url=http://www.wjtv.com/story/21654671/lawyer-wants-dismissal-charges-over-water-tests|publisher=WJTV|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Baroque]] era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/artistic-patronage History 1450–1789: Artistic Patronage], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of "[[art for art's sake]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake Britannica.com], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; began to find expression in the work of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like Marsden Hartley, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=New Yorker article, accessed online 11 November 2008 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm Jasonkaufman.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=17 October 2008 }}, accessed online 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. [[Edinburgh University Press]]. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1937, [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]], protest against Fascism]]
''Guernica'' is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75 Art and War]''. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|0857732811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''.

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.  Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists.  His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.

Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials Sharecom.ca], accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-22/entertainment/ca-25065_1_geometric-shapes | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Cathy | last=Curtis | title=Wilshire Center | date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

====Shaped canvas, Washington Color School, Abstract Illusionism, Lyrical Abstraction====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;


[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

====Abstract Illusionism, Monochrome, Minimalism, Postminimalism====

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ronald Davis]], ''Ring'', 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]]]
One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Rothhorse2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Susan Rothenberg]], 1979, [[Neo-expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, ''21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art'', BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, {{ISBN|1483582590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, ''The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2016, {{ISBN|0500239452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting'', Rutgers University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
