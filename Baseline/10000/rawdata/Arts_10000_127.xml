      <comment>/* Highest-grossing films (U.S.) */ Removed unnecessary duplicate referencing.  This section is currently contradictory as it says it is the top ten 1987 released films but features films not released in 1987 eg Platoon.  The list also links to the 1987 full grosses list from Box Office Mojo but then Trekphiler has decided to link and list the calendar grosses instead which is different from what other similar pages do so needs to be made consistent at some point</comment>

{{For|the mythological figures on whom the painting is based|Achelous|Hercules}}
'''''Achelous and Hercules''''' is a 1947 [[mural painting]] by [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. It depicts a bluejeans-wearing Heracles (Roman Hercules) wrestling with the horns of a bull, a shape the [[wikt:protean|protean]] river god [[Achelous]] was able to assume. The [[myth]] was one of the [[aition|explanations]] offered by [[classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]] for the origin of the [[cornucopia]], a symbol of agricultural abundance. Benton sets the scene during harvest time in the [[U.S. Midwest]].

The mural was formerly displayed at a department store in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], and is now in the collections of the [[Smithsonian]].  It was the first of Benton's paintings on a river-related theme.&lt;ref name="Wolff287"&gt;Justin Wolff, ''Thomas Hart Benton: A Life'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Wide image|Thomas Hart Benton - Achelous and Hercules - Smithsonian.jpg|700px|''Achelous and Hercules'' (1947) by Thomas Hart Benton, 22 feet long and more than 5 feet tall|box width|center|alt=alt text}}
''Achelous and Heracles'' is displayed at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], on the second floor of the north wing.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, ''Achelous and Hercules'' collections [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=1910 information page].&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was executed in [[egg tempera]] and [[oil paint|oil]] on canvas, and affixed to a [[plywood]] panel measuring 62⅞ by 264⅛ inches (159.6 by 671 cm).&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Eldredge, ''John Steuart&lt;!--sic--&gt; Curry's ''Hoover and the Flood'': Painting and Modern History'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2007), p. 22, where he rounds the dimensions to 63 by 262 inches.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Broun, director of the art museum, has described it as "raucous, gaudy, vibrant&amp;nbsp;... full of surging shapes and churning rhythms."&lt;ref&gt;
Elizabeth Broun, "Celebrating American Abundance," Director's Choice [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/insight/tours/benton/index.html tour.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure is the muscular, shirtless "Hercules" grappling with the horns of the bull. A second man, also wearing bluejeans and no shirt, stands by the bull's haunch and holds the end of a rope that swirls into another man's hand in the foreground, where the work of woodchopping has been interrupted. The bull's tail points into the surging, wavelike woods that rise out of the distance; a barn and silo emerge from the woods to the right. The undulating line of the rope and tail visually connect the woodlands and the timber produced from it.

The right half of the panel is dominated by a giant bounty-producing cornucopia on which a dark-haired woman reclines, leaning on her elbow with her eyes closed. Above her, a standing blonde with a less voluptuous figure holds aloft a wind-blown piece of red drapery, extending her right hand to offer a [[laurel wreath]] in mid-air. This section of the mural brings together two communicative gestures: the presentation of the wreath, and the salutation of a [[wikt:silhouette|silhouetted]] mule-mounted rider in the background who raises his hat in greeting or jubilation.

A darker-skinned boy, dressed in [[overalls]], sits next to the women on the cornucopia and holds a white cone.&lt;!--I know this cone is something specific, but I haven't been able to determine what--&gt; He is mirrored to the far left of the mural by an adult African-American who leans on a split-rail fence and watches the scene, head lifted in poised anticipation. Three [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] rise up in the landscape behind him. A fourth sheaf appears in the foreground to the right, where a man kneels with a bushel of corn ears, ready to add to the harvest bounty. Finally, a [[paddle steamer]] navigates the calm river in the background, another example of how the river is tamed.&lt;ref&gt;The significance of the steamboat is noted in the Smithsonian's Educational Insights [http://americanart.si.edu/education/insights/zoom/benton feature] on the mural.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological tradition==
The subject matter of ''Achelous and Hercules'' derives from a telling of the myth in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|Mythology]].''&lt;ref name="Eldredge20"&gt;Eldredge, ''John Steuart&lt;!--sic--&gt; Curry,'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; As a river god, Achelous normally provides "life-giving irrigation," but takes the form of a destructive bull at floodtime:&lt;ref name="Eldredge20"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hercules' conquest of the river-god was meant to evoke the taking of Missouri waterways by Kansas City pioneers; the horn that Hercules snaps from Achelous' head symbolizes the cornucopia of midwestern agriculture.&lt;ref name="Dross365"&gt;Erika Doss, ''Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism: From Regionalism to Abstract Expressionism'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Deianira]], over whom Hercules and Achelous fought, represents fecundity. She is seated on a [[wikt:prolepsis|proleptic]] cornucopia—the bull's horn has yet to be severed—from which fruits and vegetables spill. The timber in the foreground provides an important natural resource while clearing the land for farming. The Midwest is envisioned as "abundant and fertile and full of promise."&lt;ref name="Wolff287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dross365"/&gt;

"The story is thus applicable to our own land," Benton wrote in a pamphlet distributed at the store where the work was first mounted. "It fits our [[Missouri River]], which yet needs the attention of a Hercules."&lt;ref&gt;Benton as quoted by Wolff, ''Thomas Hart Benton,'' p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social context==
''Achelous and Hercules'' was painted for display at [[Harzfeld's]] department store in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].&lt;ref name="Eldredge20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doss, ''Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism'', p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; The store specialized in [[ready-to-wear]] clothing for women, and Benton later acknowledged that it was strange to see his work "in an atmosphere of silk nighties, pink slips and perfume."&lt;ref name="Wolff287"/&gt; It was his first mural commission since his historical murals for the [[Missouri State Capitol]] ten years before. In light of controversies over that project, Benton sought reassurance that Harzfeld's corporate president, Lester Siegel, would refrain from trying to exercise artistic control. Siegel in turn asked that Benton observe a certain degree of decorum.&lt;ref name="Wolff287"/&gt; After the store closed in 1984, its parent company [[Allied Stores Corporation]] made a gift of it to the Smithsonian through the institution's Collections Acquisition Program.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum, ''Achelous and Hercules'' collections [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=1910 information page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was among several of its time on the theme of "watery disaster,"&lt;ref name="Eldredge20"/&gt; reflecting a concern with flood and water management that was addressed through [[public works]] of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and post-Depression era. The economy of Kansas City in the 1940s was largely based on agriculture, which in turn was both dependent on the water supply and vulnerable to flooding from the Missouri and [[Kansas River|Kaw river]]s.&lt;ref name="Eldredge20"/&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] had begun flood-control efforts on the Missouri when Benton was creating the work, and American agricultural bounty was contributing to the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war]] rebuilding of Europe through the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

The mural was in part Benton's response to criticism from [[H.W. Janson]] of the [[nationalism|nationalist ideology]] he perceived in the art of Benton and fellow [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalist]] painters.&lt;ref name="Dross364-365"&gt;Doss, ''Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism'', pp. 364–365. Doss characterizes Benton as "the last living member of the regionalist [[triumvirate]] that Janson was intent on seeing dead and buried" (p. 364), referring to [[John Steuart Curry]] and [[Grant Wood]].&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before Benton began work, Janson had published the second of two lengthy articles criticizing the Regionalists for "racial and national chauvinism." The mythologizing of Midwestern themes was intended to grant them a universal significance, but for Janson this approach recalled the recasting of Greek myths in contemporary settings under [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Whiting128"&gt;Cécile Whiting, ''Antifascism in American Art'' (Yale University Press, 1989), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic considerations==
''Achelous and Hercules'' also served as Benton's assertion of the [[figurative art|figurative mode]] in contrast to the [[abstract expressionism]] of his former student [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name="Dross364-365"/&gt; The critical reception of this effort was not always positive: "More often than not,&amp;nbsp;... Benton's mythic visions of the Midwest looked more lewd or awkward than eternally noble. ''Achelous and Hercules'' is unnaturally stylized, as Midwestern maids take balletic leaps through the air and farmers pose like [[torero|toreadors]] in a bullring."&lt;ref name="Whiting128"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
Shadow is an ex-convict who is released from prison when his wife, Laura (McCabe) Moon, and best friend Robbie Burton die in a car accident. He takes a job as a bodyguard for a mysterious [[con man]], Mr. Wednesday. Shadow and Wednesday travel across America visiting Wednesday's acquaintances and Shadow learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of [[Odin]] the All-Father. Wednesday is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in a battle against the New American Gods – manifestations of modern life and technology, such as the Internet, media, and modern means of transport. Shadow meets a [[leprechaun]] named Mad Sweeney who gives Shadow a magical gold coin after Shadow beats him in a fight. Shadow tosses the coin into his wife's grave, inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a semi-living [[revenant]].

The New Gods abduct Shadow (utilizing a group of shadowy [[Men in Black]] led by the mysterious Mr. World), but Laura rescues him, killing several Men in Black in the process. Wednesday hides Shadow first with some Egyptian gods who run a funeral parlor in Illinois, and then in the Great Lakes community of Lakeside. They are pursued all the while by the Men in Black, particularly Mr. Town, who blames Shadow for the death of his friends.

The New Gods seek to parley with Wednesday, but murder him at the meeting. This act galvanizes the Old Gods and they rally to face their enemies in battle at [[Rock City (attraction)|Rock City]]. Shadow is bound by his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re-enacting Odin's time hanging from a "[[World Tree]]" while pierced by a spear. He is visited by [[Horus]], who is mad from living too long as a hawk. Shadow dies and visits the land of the dead, where he is judged by Anubis. Shadow learns that he is Wednesday's son, conceived as part of the deity's plans. During this time Mr. Town arrives at the World Tree, ordered by Mr. World to cut a branch from the World Tree.

Horus finds [[Ēostre|Easter]] and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life. Shadow realizes Mr. World is actually [[Loki|Low-key (Loki) Lyesmith]] and that Odin and Loki have been working a "[[Confidence trick|two-man con]]". They orchestrated Shadow's birth, his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison, and Laura's death. Loki had arranged for Odin's murder so that the battle between the New and Old Gods would serve as a sacrifice to Odin, restoring his power, while Loki would feed on the chaos of the battle. 

Laura chooses to hitchhike to Rock City and meets Mr. Town, who does not realise who she is, and they agree to travel together. During their travels Laura learns who Mr. Town is and, once they arrive at their destination, kills him and takes the branch. She then meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the tree branch which turns into a spear.

Shadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki, now gravely wounded, and the ghost of Odin, who reveal their plans. Shadow travels to the site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain and everything to lose, with Odin and Loki as the only true winners. The United States is a bad place for Gods, Shadow tells them, and he recommends they return home. The Gods depart, Loki dies and Odin's ghost fades. Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her and she finally dies.

In Iceland, Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin, created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland and much closer to the Odin of mythology than Wednesday. Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday's actions, whereupon Odin replies that "He was me, yes. But I am not him." Shadow gives Wednesday's glass eye to Odin, which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake. Shadow performs a simple sleight-of-hand coin trick, which delights Odin and who asks for a repeat performance. Shadow then performs a small piece of real magic, pulling a golden coin from nowhere before walking away from the god and out into the world.

==Influences==
The novel's dedication reads "For absent friends – [[Kathy Acker]] and [[Roger Zelazny]] and all points in between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/dreaming-american-gods-an-interview-with-neil-gaiman/ |title=Dreaming American Gods: an Interview With Neil Gaiman|last=Dornemann |first=Rudi |author2=Kelly Everding|date=Summer 2001|work=Rain Taxi Online Edition|publisher=Rain Taxi, Inc.|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Terry Pratchett novel ''[[Small Gods]]'' explores a similar origin of deities. While Gaiman says that he did not read Pratchett's work, he thought they shared a world view due to their same geographic origins and, more importantly, daily phone conversations. He had also sought advice from Pratchett on resolving plot elements of ''American Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.slashdot.org/story/03/11/03/1349252/neil-gaiman-responds |title=Neil Gaiman Responds |date=3 November 2003 |work=[[Slashdot]]|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gaiman, ''American Gods'' is not based on [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Eight Days of Luke]]'', "although they bear an odd relationship, like second cousins once removed or something". When working on the structure of a story linking gods and days of the week, he realised that this idea had already been used in ''Eight Days of Luke''. He abandoned the story, but later used the idea when writing ''American Gods'' to depict Wednesday and Shadow meeting on the god's namesake day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaiman |first=Neil |url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/exclusive/agblogarchive/2001_09 |title=Neil Gaiman – September 2001 |publisher=Neil Gaiman's Journal |date=25 September 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210224109/http://www.neilgaiman.com/exclusive/agblogarchive/2001_09| archivedate= 10 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About [[John James (writer)|John James]]'s novel ''Votan'', Gaiman stated:  “I think probably the best book ever done about the Norse was a book that I couldn’t allow myself to read between coming up with the idea of ''American Gods'' and finishing it. After it was published I actually sat down and allowed myself to read it for the first time in 15 years and discovered it was just as good as I thought it was”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shadow-writer.co.uk/neilinterview.htm |title=Interview with Neil Gaiman |year=2005 |work=Shadow Writer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021063116/http://www.shadow-writer.co.uk/neilinterview.htm |archivedate=21 October 2016|accessdate=18 November 2018|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website tie-in ==

While Gaiman was writing ''American Gods'', his publishers set up a promotional web site featuring a [[weblog]] in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of writing, revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the web site evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Web Site. {{As of|2010|post=,}} Gaiman regularly adds to the weblog, describing his daily life and the writing, revising, publishing, or promoting his current project.

On 28 February 2008, Gaiman announced on his journal that for one month, the complete text of ''American Gods'' would be available to the public on his publisher's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaiman |first=Neil |url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/kids-free-book.html |title=Kids!

Gaiman's next novel, ''[[Anansi Boys]]'', was conceived before ''American Gods'' and shares a character, Mr. Nancy ([[Anansi]], the spider god of African legend).

In an interview with [[MTV News]] published on 22 June 2011, Gaiman said that he had plans for a direct sequel to ''American Gods''. He had plans for a sequel even while writing the first book. He said he is likely to focus on New Gods in the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Gaiman Reflects On 'American Gods,' 10 Years Later |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666281/neil-gaiman-american-gods.jhtml |work=MTV News |first=Rick |last=Marshall |date=22 June 2011|accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614075056/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666281/neil-gaiman-american-gods.jhtml  |archivedate=14 June 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the planned sequel, Gaiman has written two short-story sequels featuring Shadow Moon. "The Monarch of the Glen", first published in ''[[Legends II (book)|Legends II]]'', takes place in Scotland, two years after ''American Gods''. The second short story, "Black Dog", was collected in Gaiman's ''[[Neil Gaiman bibliography#Short Story Collections|Trigger Warning]]''. It takes place a year later in [[Derbyshire]]'s Peak District.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[File:John Martin - Belshazzar's Feast - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|333px|John Martin, ''Belshazzar's Feast'', c.1821; half-size sketch held by the Yale Center for British Art]]

'''''Belshazzar's Feast''''' is an oil painting by British painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1789–1854). It was first exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in February 1821 and won a prize of £200 for the best picture.  It was so popular that it needed to be protected from the crowds by a railing, and established Martin's fame.  In the words of Martin's biographer [[William Feaver]], he "turned literary references to visual reality".  Martin published [[mezzotint]] engravings in 1826 and 1832.  The original painting is now held in a private collection; two smaller contemporaneous "sketches" are held by the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

==The subject==
The Biblical episode depicted in the painting - [[The writing on the wall|Belshazzar's Feast]] - is described in the [[Book of Daniel]]. The [[Babylon]]ian king [[Belshazzar]] is said to have defiled the sacred vessels of the enslaved [[Israelites]] by using them to serve wine at a banquet. The feast was then disturbed by the appearance of a divine hand which wrote a glowing inscription on a wall - [[the writing on the wall]] - which was interpreted by the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] as a portent of Belshazzar's doom.  Belshazzar was killed that night and [[Darius the Mede]] succeeded to his kingdom.

==History==
The painting is the second piece in a trilogy of paintings by Martin on [[Mesopotamia]]n themes, starting with his ''[[The Fall of Babylon (Martin painting)|The Fall of Babylon]]'' in 1819, and completed with his ''[[The Fall of Ninevah (Martin painting)|The Fall of Ninevah]]'' in 1828.  It was inspired by a conversation with the American artist [[Washington Allston]] and perhaps also by a poem by [[Thomas Smart Hughes]].

It shows a panoramic view of a cavernous banqueting room with columns to either side decorated with [[signs of the zodiac]].  The hall is filled with crowds of feasting Babylonians, and open to the sky, with the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] above, and the [[Tower of Babel]] and a [[ziggurat]] visible in the background, lit by the moon revealed by a break in dark swirling clouds.  The architecture is inspired by Egyptian, Babylonian and Indian styles. Dressed in black, Daniel stands at the centre of the foreground, interpreting the supernatural writing on the wall of the hall. Belshazzar recoils in astonishment and dread to his right, and others look on in shock and horror.

Martin published an accompanying pamphlet with a key to help viewers to interpret the painting and identify the figures and structures.  Although popular with the public, Martin's painting was not a critical success.  There was appreciation of the magnificent architecture and emotional content, of the scale and bold colours of the work, but criticism of his painterly technique and particularly the execution of the figures.  [[Charles Lamb]] called it vulgar and bombastic.

Martin sold the painting to his former master, glass painter [[William Collins (glass painter)|William Collins]], for 1,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] before the exhibition in 1821, and Collins made Martin agree not to reproduce the painting until Collins sold it.  The [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] offered Martin 800 guineas; disappointed, he commissioned Martin to paint ''[[The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum]]'' instead.  Collins sent the painting on an extensive tour of Britain, and it was wildly successful.  By 1826, the accompanying pamphlet had reached its 45th edition. Martin was preparing to publish an engraved version in 1826 when Collins sued under the agreement not to reproduce the painting.  Martin successfully claimed that he was reproducing his preliminary sketches, not the finished work, and versions of his engraving were published in 1826, in 1832, and for his ''Illustrations of the Bible'' project in 1835

The painting was bought by Liverpool merchant [[John Naylor (Liverpool merchant)|John Naylor]] in 1848.  It was damaged in 1854 on its journey to Naylor's gallery at [[Leighton Hall, Powys|Leighton Hall]] near [[Welshpool]], when the cart transporting it was hit by a train, but the painting was quickly repaired.  It was rejected by the [[National Gallery]] as being too large - {{convert|160|xx|249|cm|in}} - and is now part of a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;Myrone, Martin [ed.], John Martin: Apocalypse, London, Tate publishing, 2011, pp. 99-101. {{ISBN|1854378899}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited in 2011 at [[Tate Britain]], next to a half-size "sketch" made by the artist himself in c.1820, {{convert|80|xx|120.7|cm|in}}, now owned by the Yale Center for British Art.  Another "sketch" is owned by the Wadsworth Atheneum.

[[File:Street Fighter V breast physics.gif|thumb|The exaggerated breast physics of ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' (seen on the character on the right), which were later corrected in a patch]]

In [[video games]], '''breast physics''' or '''jiggle physics''' are a feature that makes a female character's [[breast]]s bounce when she moves, sometimes in an exaggerated or unnatural manner.

==History==
The first video game in which breast physics were a notable feature was the [[fighting game]] ''[[Fatal Fury 2]]'' (1992), which featured the fighter [[Mai Shiranui]], who had noticeably jiggly breasts.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez |first1=Patricia |title=How Video Game Breasts Are Made (And Why They Can Go Wrong) |url=http://kotaku.com/how-video-game-breasts-are-made-and-why-they-can-go-so-1687753475 |accessdate=12 February 2017 |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=24 February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204024702/http://kotaku.com/how-video-game-breasts-are-made-and-why-they-can-go-so-1687753475 |archivedate=4 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pronounced breast physics have since remained a staple feature of many fighting games, perhaps in part because these games contain fewer character models than other games and can therefore afford to animate their characters in more detail.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt; The ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series (1996–), in particular, has become identified with the "outlandish" physics of both its fighting moves and its female characters' breasts.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt; 

On occasion, this aspect of fighting games has caused particular attention, such as when the 2015 game ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' had the fighter [[Chun-Li]]'s breasts move like large water balloons when she was chosen as the second player's character in the selection screen. Although this behavior was noticed by media even before the game's release, it remained present in the released version of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez |first1=Patricia |title=Street Fighter V's Ridiculous Breast Physics Are Still In The Game |url=http://kotaku.com/street-fighter-vs-ridiculous-breast-physics-are-still-i-1759446755 |accessdate=12 February 2017 |work=Kotaku |date=16 February 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213163628/http://kotaku.com/street-fighter-vs-ridiculous-breast-physics-are-still-i-1759446755 |archivedate=13 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's publisher [[Capcom]] attributed it to a [[Software bug|bug]] and later removed it by a [[Patch (computing)|patch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yin-Poole |first1=Wesley |title=Capcom patches out Chun-Li's ridiculous boob physics |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-29-capcom-patches-out-chun-lis-ridiculous-boob-physics |accessdate=12 February 2017 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=29 March 2016 |language=en-UK |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213001625/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-03-29-capcom-patches-out-chun-lis-ridiculous-boob-physics |archivedate=13 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the prevalence of big, bouncy breasts in video games, games writer Jenn Frank initiated a "boob jam" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boob Jam|url=http://theboobjam.com/|website=theboobjam.com|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the initiative was to create games that deal "with an aspect of female breasts other than the fact that they're sexy and fun to look at".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Boob Jam' explores unsexy side of breasts|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/08/09/boob-jam-game-development-challenge.html|accessdate=27 July 2017|work=Fox News|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
In a game with [[3D graphics]], character models are composed of a skeleton of "bones" connected with joints and covered by a "skin" of [[Texture mapping|textured]] [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]. These virtual bones do not necessarily correspond to the bones in real humans, but are required to make anything move – for example, breasts, which do not in reality contain bones. To make breasts or other body parts move, video game animators make the bones' joints move according to the physical rules of the game's engine.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt;

To effect breast movement in most 3D games, the breast's bones are equipped with "springs" that make the breasts bounce when the rest of the skeleton moves. The setup and strength of these springs determines the strength of the breast bounce. Alternatively, the motion of the breasts may be governed by custom-written software, but this is more time-consuming and therefore rarer than using springs, which are a built-in feature in many [[game engine]]s.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt;

==Unnatural breast physics==
Many video games feature breast movements that appear unnatural or exaggerated, particularly to female observers.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt; This may result from limitations of the "springs" system, which is better suited to animating rigid bodies rather than soft objects like breasts.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt; In some games, however, exaggerated breast physics are intentional. This may be caused by increasing the bounce effect in order to make it noticeable even when a character is standing still and talking, which may result in wildly exaggerated bounces when she actually moves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt;

Ultimately, however, according to game developer Tim Dawson, if a video game features unnatural breast movements, "it's because somebody wanted them to look that way". Not only breasts, but also other body parts such as male muscles are often intentionally exaggerated or unrealistically portrayed in video games.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 24 February 2015" /&gt;

[[File:Ardabil Carpet.jpg|thumb|right|170px| One of the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s]]
[[File:Wollteppich_1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A small rug]]
A '''carpet''' is a [[textile]] [[floor covering]] typically consisting of an upper layer of [[Pile (textile)|pile]] attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but, since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts which are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug", although the term "carpet" can be applied to a floor covering that covers an entire house, whereas a "rug" is generally no bigger than a single room, and traditionally does not even span from one wall to another, and is typically not even attached as part of the floor.

Carpets are used for a variety of purposes, including insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a [[prayer rug]]), reducing sound from walking (particularly in [[apartment buildings]]) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and [[hotel]]s and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are [[mass production|mass-produced]] in [[factory|factories]] and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.

Carpets can be produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]], made using needle [[felt]]s, knotted by hand (in [[oriental rug]]s), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric or [[embroidery|embroidered]]. Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the USA, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Since the 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.

The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodWeave.org/index.php?cid=13 |title=About the GoodWeave label |publisher=Goodweave.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:A carpet seller in Jaipur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A carpet seller in [[Jaipur]], India]]
It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into English (English: carpet) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term "carpet" was first used in English in the late 13th century, with the meaning "coarse cloth", and by the mid-14th century, "tablecloth, [or] bedspread".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The meaning of the term "carpet" shifted in the 15th century to refer to floor coverings.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The term ''[[wikt:carpet|carpet]]'' comes from [[Old French]] ''carpite''. It is assumed that the word "carpet" entered into French (French: carpette) in the 13th century (through Medieval Latin carpita, meaning "thick woolen cloth") [11] as a consequence of the trade in rugs through the port cities of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia. One derivation of the term states that the French term came from the [[Old Italian]] ''carpita'', from the verb "carpire" meaning ''to pluck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/carpet |title=Definition of carpet|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carpet |title=Carpet - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the term comes "...from Old French carpite "heavy decorated cloth, carpet," from Medieval Latin or Old Italian carpita "thick woolen cloth," probably from Latin carpere "to card, pluck," probably so called because it was made from unraveled, shred[d]ed, "plucked" fabric".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; 

The term "carpet" is often used interchangeably with the term "rug". Some sources define a carpet as stretching from wall to wall.&lt;ref&gt;How It's Made, Season 2, Episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term "carpet" was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.

The term "rug" was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning "coarse fabric". The term is of "...Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian dialectal rugga "coarse coverlet," from [[Old Norse]] rogg "shaggy tuft," from Proto-Germanic *rawwa-, perhaps related to rag (n.) and rough (adj.)."&lt;ref name="etymonline2"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rug Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of "rug" "...evolved to "coverlet, wrap" (1590s), then "mat for the floor" (1808)".&lt;ref name="etymonline2"/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Moden carpet illustrating camel caravan on Silk Road. Kashgar.jpg|thumb|left|Modern carpet illustrating a camel caravan on the [[Silk Road]]]]

===Woven===
The carpet is produced on a [[loom]] quite similar to [[woven fabric]]. The pile can be [[plush]] or [[Berber carpet|Berber]]. Plush carpet is a cut [[Pile (textile)|pile]] and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.

===Needle felt===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|A [[Persian carpet#Field design - medallions and borders|''toranj'' medallion]], a common design in [[Persian carpets]]]]
These carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle [[felt]]s are produced by intermingling and felting individual [[synthetic fiber]]s using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.

===Knotted===
{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}
[[File:Carpet in Preparation on a Carpet Loom.jpg|thumb|A traditional rug being woven on a carpet [[loom]]]]
On a '''knotted pile''' carpet (formally, a "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" carpet), the structural [[weft]] threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] by one of three knot types (see below), such as [[shag carpet]] which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or [[nap (textile)|nap]] of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in [[oriental rug]]s and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the '''symmetrical''' (also called Turkish or [[Ghiordes knot|Ghiordes]]) and '''asymmetrical''' (also called Persian or [[Senna knot|Senna]]). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: [[Lahore]] and [[Peshawar]] ([[Pakistan]]), [[Kashmir]] ([[India]]), [[Mirzapur]], [[Bhadohi]],&lt;ref name="to"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-09/varanasi/28226568_1_bhadohi-mirzapur-bhadohi-carpet-carpet-manufacturers-association|title=Famed Bhadohi carpet gets GI tag|date=September 9, 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tabriz]] ([[Iran]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Northern Africa]], [[Nepal]], [[Spain]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tibetan rugs|Tibet]]. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that [[Flag of Turkmenistan|the national flag]] features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool. The [[GoodWeave]] labelling scheme used throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Tufted===
[[File:Swatches of carpet 1.jpg|thumb|[[Textile sample|Swatches]] of [[Tufting|tufted]] carpet]]
[[Image:OurikaValleyCarpets.jpg|thumb|Drying carpets in a village workshop at the [[Ourika Valley|Ourika Valley, Morocco]]]]
These are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.

===Others===
A '''flatweave''' carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include [[kilim]], [[soumak]], [[plain weave]], and [[tapestry weave]]. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, [[damask]], list, [[haircloth]], and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).

A '''hooked rug''' is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a [[handicraft]]. The process of creating a hooked rug is called [[Rug hooking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science Of Color Enhances Carpet Style|url=http://www.carpet-rug.org/Carpet-for-Business/Specifying-the-Right-Carpet/Dyeing-and-Color-Selection.aspx|website=carpet-rug.org|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike woven carpets, '''[[embroidery]] carpets'''' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] to a [[cloth]] (often [[linen]]) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the [[Bradford carpet]]). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the [[coat of arms]] of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called [[Berlin wool work]], were introduced in [[Germany]] in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.

==Fibres and yarns==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova 138.jpg|thumb|A [[Moldova]]n [[Postage stamp|stamp]] featuring a carpet]]
Carpet can be formulated from many single or blended [[nature|natural]] and [[synthetic fibre]]s. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heisterberg-Moutsis, Rainer Heinz, Thomas F. Wolf, Dominic J. Harper, David James, Richard P. Mazzur, Volker Kettler, Hansgert Soiné "Floor Coverings" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nylon===
Since the 20th century, [[nylon]] is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both [[nylon 6]] and [[nylon 6-6]] are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.

===Polypropylene===
[[Polypropylene]], a [[polyolefin]] stiffer than the cheaper [[polyethylene]], is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.

===Wool and wool-blends===
[[File:2012-10-02 Wurstteppich huchwasistdenndas anagoria.jpg|thumb|A wool carpet]]
[[Wool]] has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term "80/20". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.

===Polyester===
The [[polyester]] known as "PET" ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, and, unlike nylon, does not have dye sites. Colour is infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.

Another polyester, "PTT" ([[Polytrimethylene terephthalate]]), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers.

===Acrylic===
[[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or "pill" easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.

==History==

It was excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1949 from a [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk burial]] mound in the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183&amp;nbsp;cm (6'6" x 6'0") and framed by a border of griffins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |title=The State Hermitage Museum: Collection Highlights |publisher=Hermitagemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005151326/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7d.html |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although claimed by many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments color was made from [[Armenian cochineal]].&lt;ref name=vk2&gt;[[Ashkhunj Poghosyan]], [[:File:Ashkhunj Poghosyan, On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013(2).pdf|On origin of Pazyryk rug, Yerevan, 2013]] (PDF) pp. 1-21 {{ref-hy}}, pp. 22-37 {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USSR conference to exchange experiences leading restorers and researchers.

===Afghanistan===
{{main article|Afghan rug}}
There has recently been a surge in demand for Afghan carpets, although many Afghan carpet manufacturers market their products under the name of a different country.&lt;ref name="pajhwok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanembassyjp.com/en/news/?an=1377 |title=Afghan rugs sell like hot cakes |publisher=Afghanembassyjp.com |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are made in Afghanistan, as well as by [[Afghan refugees]] who reside in Pakistan and Iran. Famous Afghan rugs include the ''[[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]]'' or ''[[Adraskan]]'' (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the [[Herat Province|Herat]] area in western Afghanistan.

Afghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and well recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as [[vegetable dye]]s, are used to impart rich color.

===Armenia===
{{main article|Armenian carpet}}

The historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.[23] Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. This square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, "From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Ulrich%20Schurmann%22 Ulrich Schurmann, The Pazyryk. Its Use and Origin, Munich, 1982, p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.
[[Armenian carpet]]s were renowned by foreigners who travelled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian [[Al-Masudi]] noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ulubabyan| first = Bagrat A| authorlink =Bagrat Ulubabyan| title = Խաչենի իշխանությունը, X-XVI դարերում (The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th Centuries)| publisher =Armenian Academy of Sciences| location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR| year = 1975| page=267| isbn = |language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that "Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making."&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"&gt;Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in colour and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as ''artsvagorgs'' (eagle-carpets), ''vishapagorgs'' (dragon-carpets) and ''otsagorgs'' (serpent-carpets).&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt; The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, "covered with vegatative ornaments", and bears an artistic resemblance to the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced in Artsakh.&lt;ref name="Hakobyan. p. 84"/&gt;

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]], a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]]. ''Պատմություն Հայոց '' (''History of Armenia''). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1961, p. 216, as cited in Hakobyan. ''Medieval Art of Artsakh'', p. 84, note 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azerbaijan===
{{Main article|Azerbaijani rug}}

The Gultapin excavations discovered several carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. According to Iranica Online "''The main weaving zone was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, the area now comprised in the Azerbaijan SSR; it is the homeland of a Turkic population known today as Azeri. Other ethnic groups also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|title=CARPETS xv. Caucasian Carpets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan was one of the most important centers of carpet weaving and as a result of that, several different schools have evolved. While traditionally schools are divided into four main branches, each region has its own version of the carpets. The Schools are divided into four main branches: Kuba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh carpet-weaving school, The Baku carpet school, Karabakh school of carpet weaving.

===China===
{{See also|Oriental rug}}
As opposed to most antique rug manufactory practices, Chinese carpets were woven almost exclusively for internal consumption. China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce [[art-deco]] rugs with [[commerce|commercial]] look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of [[Ch'ung Chen]], the last emperor of the [[Chen Dynasty]].

===India===

Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the [[Ghaznavids]] and the [[Ghauris]], from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.

[[Akbar]], a Mogul emperor, is accredited to introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian craftsmen from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of the Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, [[Agra]] and Bhadohi.

Indian carpets are known for their high density of knotting. Hand-knotted carpets are a speciality and widely in demand in the West. The carpet industry in India has been successful in establishing social business models that help underprivileged sections of the society. Notable examples of [[social entrepreneurship]] ventures are [[Jaipur rugs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |title=A Case of Social Entrepreneurship |publisher=Chillibreeze.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215919/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles_various/Jaipur-rugs-1101.asp |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fabindia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-05-06/news/27717265_1_handloom-weavers-shareholders-fabric-suppliers |title= Handloom weavers shareholders fabric suppliers | work=The Times Of India | date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another category of Indian rugs which, though quite popular in most of the western countries, have not received much press, is hand-woven rugs of Khairabad (Citapore rugs). {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[Khairabad, Sitapur|Khairabad]] small town in Citapore (now spelled as "[[Sitapur]]") district of India had been ruled by Raja [[Mehmoodabad]]. Khairabad (Mehmoodabad Estate) was part of [[Oudh]] province which had been ruled by [[shi'i]] Muslims having Persian linkages. Citapore rugs made in Khairabad and neighbouring areas are all hand-woven and distinct from tufted and knotted rugs. Flat weave is the basic weaving technique of Citapore rugs and generally cotton is the main weaving material here but jute, rayon and chenille are also popular. ''[[IKEA]]'' and ''[[Agocha]]'' have been major buyers of rugs from this area.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Pakistani rug}}

The art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]]– ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]– have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Peter F. The Oriental Rug Lexicon. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in [[Sangla Hill]], a small town of District Sheikhupura. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Ganda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point in Carpet Industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.

The Persian carpet is a part of Persian (Iranian) art and culture. Carpet-[[weaving]] in Persia dates back to the [[Bronze Age]]. The earliest surviving corpus of Persian carpets come from the [[Safavid]] dynasty (1501–1736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th century. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s, [[palmette]]s, [[cloud band]]s, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is because [[Islam]], the dominant religion in that part of the world, forbids their depiction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes. The majority of these carpets are wool, but several [[silk]] examples produced in [[Kashan]] survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Arthur Upham. A Survey of Persian Art from Prehistoric Times to the Present. Vol. XI, Carpets, Chapter 55. New York: Oxford University Press, 1938-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandinavian rugs are among the most popular of all weaves in modern design. Preferred by influential modernist thinkers, designers, and advocates for a new aesthetic in the mid-twentieth century, Scandinavian rugs have become very widespread in many different avenues of contemporary interior design. With a long history of adaptation and evolution, the tradition of Scandinavian rug-making is among the most storied of all European rug-making traditions.

The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.

The oldest records of flat woven kilims come from [[Çatalhöyük]] Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C. One of the oldest settlements ever to have been discovered, Çatalhöyük is located south east of Konya in the middle of the Anatolian region.&lt;ref name="Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html |title=Çatalhöyük.com: Ancient Civilization and Excavation |publisher=Catalhoyuk.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101144734/http://www.catalhoyuk.com/mission.html# |archive-date=2016-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations to date (only 3% of the town) not only found carbonized fabric but also fragments of kilims painted on the walls of some of the dwellings.

The knotted rug is believed to have reached Asia Minor and the Middle East with the expansion of various nomadic tribes peoples during the latter period of the great [[Turkic migration]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. Famously depicted in European paintings of [[The Renaissance]], beautiful Anatolian rugs were often used from then until modern times, to indicate the high economic and social status of the owner.

Women learn their weaving skills at an early age, taking months or even years to complete the beautiful pile rugs and flat woven kilims that were created for their use in every aspect of daily life. As is true in most weaving cultures, traditionally and nearly exclusively, it is women and girls who are both artisan and weaver.&lt;ref name="The Dominant role of women and girls in Turkish carpet weaving"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/tapestry/anatolian-carpets/carpet-weaving-tradition-600.htm?type=1 |title=The Dominant role of Turkish Women and Girls in Turkish carpet weaving |publisher=Turkishculture.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Türkmen carpet (also called "Bukhara Uzbekistan") is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in Central Asia. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export in the 2000s, mainly in Pakistan and Iran. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes who are the main ethnic group in [[Turkmenistan]] and are also found in Afghanistan and Iran. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf Living legend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212110046/http://medeniyet.gov.tm/downloads/rowayat_ru.pdf |date=December 12, 2013 }}, The president of Turkmenistan [[Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov]] book about Turkmen rug&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental carpets in Europe====
Oriental carpets began to appear in Europe after the [[Crusades]] in the 11th century, due to contact by Crusaders with Eastern traders. Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French [[East India Company|East India Companies]] of the 17th and 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Maurice Sven and Jean Mailey.

Although isolated instances of carpet production pre-date the Muslim invasion of Spain, the [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples are the earliest significant body of European-made carpets. Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called [[Synagogue carpet]] in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, [[Admiral carpet]]s (also known as [[armorial carpet]]s), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by [[May Beattie]]. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Two of the most popular motifs are wreaths and pomegranates.

During the [[Moorish]] (Muslim) period production took place in [[Alcaraz]] in the province of Murcia, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the [[Royal Tapestry Factory]] ''(Real Fábrica de Tapices de Santa Bárbara)'' in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the [[Spanish civil war]] [[General Franco]] revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"&gt;Sherrill, Sarah B.

{{main article |Pirot carpet}}
'''Pirot carpet'''{{Cref2|a}} ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Пиротски ћилим, Pirotski ćilim) refers to a variety of flat tapestry-woven carpets or rugs traditionally produced in [[Pirot]], a town in southeastern Serbia. Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;LEPOTA TRAJANJA&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the šajkaši boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople.Pirot was also known as Şarköy in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.

In the beginning of the 19th century plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. "The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and woof as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as Şarköy stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as Şarköy-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today's Turkish settlement of Şarköy in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, Şarköys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug selling industry, Şarköy are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non familiar customers as they prefer rug with putative oriental origin. In fact, Şarköys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokow. Later they have been also produced in Knjaževac and Caribrod.

{{main article |Chiprovtsi carpet}}
The [[Chiprovtsi carpet]] (Чипровци килим) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of [[Chiprovtsi]] where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] against Ottoman rule. The western traveller [[Ami Boué]], who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836–1838, reported that "mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving. They earn only five [[franc]]s a month and the payment was even lower before". By 1868, the annual production of carpets in Chiprovtsi had surpassed 14,000&amp;nbsp;square metres.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, almost 1,400 women from Chiprovtsi and the region were engaged in carpet weaving. In 1920, the locals founded the ''Manual Labour'' carpet-weaving cooperative society, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Костова, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At present. the carpet (''kilim'') industry remains dominant in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_Bulgarian/Theme_Ikonomika_Ekologia_Turizam/Material/2505-5.htm|title=Чипровските килими—запазена марка на килимарския бизнес в България|last=Димитрова|first=Милка|date=2005-05-25|publisher=[[Bulgarian National Radio|БНР]] [[Radio Bulgaria|Радио България]]|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-09-19}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, but in recent years it is up to the customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single {{convert|3|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the primary material is wool, coloured using plant or mineral [[dye]]s. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and [[Brussels]]. In recent decades, however, the Chiprovtsi carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.

[[File:Savonnerie tapisserie 18th century Versailles.jpg|thumb|An 18th century [[Savonnerie]] tapisserie at the [[Palace of Versailles]]]]
{{Main article|Savonnerie manufactory}}
In 1608 [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] initiated the French production of "Turkish style" carpets under the direction of [[Pierre DuPont (carpet maker)|Pierre DuPont]]. This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of [[Simon Lourdet]], are the carpets that were produced in the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon in the [[Palais du Louvre]] between c. 1665-1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of [[Charles Le Brun]], were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1688. Their design combines rich [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by [[Cesare Ripa]]'s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV's royal power.

[[Pierre-Josse Perrot]] is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags. The Savonnerie manufactory was moved to the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] in Paris in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;(french) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bN_HkKC1xNUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=savonnerie+manufacture+gobelins+1826&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=5frOTtrDD4f3sgbnm6XCDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=savonnerie%20manufacture%20gobelins%201826&amp;f=false Jean Coural, ''Les Gobelins'', Nouvelles Editions Latines, 1989, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt; The Beauvais manufactory, better known for their [[tapestry]], also made knotted pile carpets from 1780 to 1792. Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, Sarah B 1996"/&gt;

===England===
Knotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[Calvinist]]s fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern [[England]] in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as "Norwich carpets." These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756–1761, owned by [[Claude Passavant]], 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by [[Thomas Whitty]], numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer [[Robert Adam]] supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] floor [[mosaics]] and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for [[Syon House]], [[Osterley House]], [[Harewood House]], [[Saltram House]], and [[Newby Hall]].

{{visible anchor|Axminster carpet}} was a unique floor covering made originally in a [[Axminster Carpets|factory]] founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver [[Thomas Whitty]]. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46332/Axminster-carpet |title=Axminster carpet - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axminster carpet has three main types of broadloom carpet construction in use today (machine woven, tufted &amp; hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.

[[File:Rug.jpg|thumb|Machine used to cut and re-roll carpet lengths]]
Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.

Six of Axminster carpets are known as the "Lansdowne" group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population town still seek employment in this industry. The town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire]] is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior Decoration: A Complete Source|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&amp;dq=lansdowne+group+axminster+carpets&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|work=Google book|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brussels Loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.

Later when bladed wires were developed the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.

Brussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.

After the first World War the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Carpets'' by George Robinson F.T.I., F.S.D.C. published 1966 Chap 7 Wilton Carpets page 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern carpeting and installation==
[[File:Berber Carpet (macro).jpg|thumb|[[Macro photography|Macro]] shot of a [[Berber carpet|Berber-style carpet]]. Berber-style carpets feature two sizes of tufts of varying colors in a loop pile construction]]
Carpet is commonly made in widths of {{convert|12|ft|m}} and {{convert|15|ft|m}} in the US, 4&amp;nbsp;m and 5&amp;nbsp;m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was [[sewing|sewn]] together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned [[underlay]] (pad) using nails, [[tack strip]]s (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal [[stair rod]]s, thus distinguishing it from rugs or [[mat]]s, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.

In the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of {{convert|27|in|m}} and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.
Carpet tiles are also available, typically {{convert|50|cm|in}} square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement in order to spread wear.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Alan J. The Complete Carpet Buying Guide. Portland Oregon: AJ Books 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Carpet binding" is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.

==In culture and figurative expressions==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|A mythical [[magic carpet]]]]
There are many stories about [[magic carpet]]s, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney's Aladdin depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie's lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on him to go on a ride around the world. The term "[m]agic carpet [is] first attested [in] 1816.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; From the 16th century to the 19th century, the term "carpet" was used "...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)", which meant a man who was associated with "...luxury, ladies' boudoirs, and drawing rooms".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; ''Rolling out the red carpet'' is an expression which means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual [[red carpet]] is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.

In 1820s British servant slang, to "carpet" someone means to call them for a reprimand.&lt;ref name="etymonline1" /&gt; To be ''called on the carpet'' means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=carpet. Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger variant of this expression, to be "hauled on the carpet", implies an even sterner reprimand. [[Carpet bombing]] is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression "laugh at the carpet" means to [[vomit]] on the floor (especially a carpeted floor).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/carpet Carpet - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "on the carpet" refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The term "carpet muncher" is a derogatory slang term for a [[lesbian]]; this expression is first attested in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpet-muncher Carpet muncher | Define Carpet muncher at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The_Carpet_Seller,_a_figurine_by_Royal_Doulton.jpg|thumb|left|''The Carpet Seller'', a [[Royal Doulton]] figurine]]
The term [[carpet bag]], which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the [[American Civil War]] to refer to [[carpetbaggers]], Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a [[mutual organization]], such as a [[building society]], in order to force it to [[Demutualization|demutualize]], that is, to convert into a [[joint stock company]], solely for personal financial gain.

''Cutting the rug'' is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The use of the term "rug" as an informal term for a "[[toupee]]" (man's [[wig]]) is [[theater]] slang from 1940.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The term "sweep [something] under the rug" or "sweep [something] under the carpet" figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953.&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The figurative expression "pull the rug out from under (someone)", meaning to "suddenly deprive of important support" is first attested to in 1936, in American English. A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was "cut the grass under (one's) feet", which is attested to in the 1580s.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; A "rugrat" or "rug-rat" is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968.&lt;ref name="etymonline2" /&gt; The expression "snug as a bug in a rug" means
"wrapped up tight, warm, and comfortable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/snug+as+a+bug+in+a+rug Snug as a bug in a rug - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; To "lie like a rug" means "to tell lies shamelessly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/lie+like+a+rug Lie like a rug - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "pull the rug out (from under someone)" means "to make someone or someone's plans fall through" or "to upset someone's plans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pull+the+rug+out Pull the rug out - Idioms by The Free Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chamber Music Journal''''' is a [[periodical]] devoted exclusively to non-standard, rare or unknown chamber music of merit. (i.e., not Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms etc.) Between 1990 and 2010, it was published in hardcopy and available by subscription only. Since 2011, it has been exclusively published online. All issues, past and current, are available at no cost. It is under the general editorship of R.H.R. Silvertrust.

The Chamber Music Journal is considered one of the leading chamber music reference sources in English. It features articles with hard-to-find information that often has been published nowhere else, an example being a 13-part series on the 36 string quartets of the important 19th-century French composer [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]. The chamber music of [[Borodin]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], the piano trios of [[Richard Strauss]], the chamber music of the [[Terezin Composers]], [[Joseph Rheinberger]], [[Eric Zeisl]],  [[Max Bruch]], [[Willem Pijper]], [[Zdenek Fibich]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] are among the subjects which appeared in past issues.

The '''DC Animated Universe''' ('''DCAU'''; also referred to as the '''Timmverse''' by fans) is the [[shared universe]] centered on a group of [[Animated series|animated television series]] based on [[DC Comics]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] from the early 1990s to mid-2000s; beginning with ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in 1992, and ending with ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p7.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greatestcartoons"&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html "The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529093939/http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}. IGN. January 26, 2007. Retrieved May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the associated media franchise including [[direct-to-video]] feature films and [[Short film|shorts]], comic books, video games and other multimedia adaptations are also included in the continuity.

== List of DCAU media ==
[[File:DCAU batsuits.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Batman]]'s various character designs from the DCAU; he has been the most-featured character in this animated continuity, due to being the star of the original TV series in the DCAU.]]
While there have been several animated projects based upon DC Comics characters over the decades, what is commonly accepted as the DC animated universe consists of the stable of TV series and films that spin off from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' (1992–1995), the first TV show in this continuity. Two characters outside of the normal [[Batman]] canon, [[Zatanna]] and [[Jonah Hex]], appeared on the show, but the first series to indicate a shared continuity with other well-known characters was the subsequent show, ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', in which the [[Superman|title character]] has encounters with heroes such as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and the [[Green Lantern]].

Older shows such as ''[[Super Friends]]'' and newer shows such as ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' are not part of this continuity. The direct-to-video [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], such as ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' and ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', are also not considered part of the DCAU, despite utilizing similar character designs and several of them featuring much of the same voice cast as previous DCAU series.

An animated series based on the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' comic books was planned for the DC animated universe during the mid-1990s, but was finally scrapped.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521063619/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a ''Teen Titans'' series not related to the DC animated universe was released. Also, after the success of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the early 1990s, Fox approached producer [[Bruce Timm]] to create a spin-off series focusing on [[Catwoman]], but the project never materialized.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Feature-length films ===
The following animated feature films also are part of the DCAU continuity:

*''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (1993; theatrical release)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ca.ign.com/articles/2010/06/25/top-25-animated-movies-of-all-time| title=''Top 25 Animated Movies of All-Time''| publisher= [[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/ |title=''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''| work =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate=2008-01-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080130003635/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm/| archivedate= January 30, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (1998; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (2000; direct-to-video)
*''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' (2003; direct-to-video)

&lt;!--editnote | NOTE: Do not add a series or section to the "DC animated universe" article without first reading the edit guidelines and criteria section at the top of the talk page (found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:DC_animated_universe). Any additions made will be reverted unless said guidelines are followed. Thank you!--&gt;
Before the release of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', a third animated feature based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' was planned, entitled ''Batman: Arkham''. The film was supposed to be a follow-up for ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', and [[Boyd Kirkland]] was attached to write and direct; but the project was soon scrapped. A second ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' movie was planned for release but was finally scrapped due to the dark tones and controversies of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516063839/http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2003, during the production of ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] approached Kirkland to write a [[Catwoman]] [[direct-to-video]] feature film as a tie-in with the [[Catwoman (film)|2004 live-action film]]. Although the script was written, the project was soon scrapped after the poor reception of the live-action film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010942/http://worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/kirkland.php |archivedate=May 30, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a direct-to-video feature-length animated film entitled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'' was planned to connect ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' with its follow-up ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', but the production was finally cancelled in 2004, and the script was later rewritten for the animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', that was not part of the DC animated universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182731/http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action%3Dfullnews%26id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920221050/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=222 |archivedate=September 20, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short films ===
&lt;!-- While the Superman 75th Anniversary short does feature a few frames in the DCAU styling, please do not include it on this list. The short is an homage to Superman as a character throughout the years and not set in the canon of the DCAU --&gt;
&lt;!-- Batman Strange Days is not part of the DCAU. While it features a similar style due to being drawn by Bruce Timm, it's set in a different time period, and the character models are different. Please do not include it on this list--&gt;
*''The Dark Knight's First Night'' (1990) – A short film which acted as the developmental pilot for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
*''[[Chase Me]]'' (2003)&amp;nbsp;– A short film with no dialogue based on ''The New Batman Adventures''.
*''Batman Black &amp; White: Two of a Kind'' (2008) - A motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm's "Two-Face: Two of a Kind"
*''Mad Love'' (2008) - A 3 part motion comic adaptation of Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's "Batman Adventures: Mad Love"
*''Batman Beyond'' (2014) – A short film based on ''Batman Beyond'' created by [[Darwyn Cooke]] for Batman's 75th anniversary. The short features the original voice cast of the show, as well as cameos of robotic batmen from ''The New Batman Adventures'', ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Michael Keaton]]'s Batman, [[Adam West]]'s Batman, and the original comic book Batman from 1939.

=== Web cartoons ===
*''[[Gotham Girls]]'' (2000–2002)&amp;nbsp;– A [[Adobe Flash|Macromedia Flash]] web cartoon series, this was downloadable from the WB website, and featured DCAU versions of characters voiced by their original actors. A DC Comics [[miniseries]] inspired by the web series was released in 2004. All three seasons of ''Gotham Girls'' were released on the ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' DVD box set in 2008.
*''[[Lobo (DC Comics)#Webseries|Lobo]]'' (2000)&amp;nbsp;– A Flash cartoon series starring [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], the galactic bounty hunter, the web-series is a spin-off of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' episode "The Main Man." A wax statue with the same character design as Lobo in this series appeared in an episode of ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' and he also made a reappearance in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter" briefly becoming a member of the Justice League. Both of these examples somewhat support that the webseries is part of the official DCAU, although this is still disputed. Unlike the other cartoons set in the DCAU, it has graphic violence, sexual content and strong profanity.

=== Comic books ===
{{Main article|DC animated universe (comics)}}
Many of the DCAU productions have also had [[comic book]]s created based on the characters of the various series, though their canonicity is disputable. The comics are:
&lt;!-- While some may see it as debatable that the Beyond series from 2010-2014 are canon due to their inclusion of elements from mainstream DC comics, author Kyle Higgins has stated that they "continue the animated universe" and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Although the Shadow of Sin Tzu comics don't use the animated style, they are a follow up to the DCAU based game and thus should be left on the list. --&gt;

== Characters adapted from the DCAU ==
{{See also|List of DC animated universe characters}}

Though the DCAU is an offshoot of the mainstream DC comics universe, it has also affected the DC universe in return. The following characters were originally created for their respective series in the DCAU, but were eventually adapted via [[retroactive continuity]] into the mainstream DC comic continuity:

*[[Nora Fries]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Harley Quinn]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Renee Montoya]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Sewer King (Batman)|Sewer King]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Condiment King|The Condiment King]] (''Batman: The Animated Series'')
*[[Mercy Graves]] ''(Superman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] ''(Superman: The Animated Series)''
*[[Roxy Rocket]] ''(The New Batman Adventures)''
*[[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]]/Batman ''(Batman Beyond)''
*[[Gray Ghost (DC animated universe)|Gray Ghost]] ''(Batman: The Animated Series)''

;Retroactive continuity
In addition, the backstory of [[Mr. Freeze]] was adapted from his portrayal in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and the visuals and/or characterization of [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Supergirl]], [[Toyman]], [[Two-Face]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Metallo]], [[Clayface]], and many others have been applied to their comic counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} On a different note, issue #22 of DC Comics' ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, which explores alternate realities, had [[Bizarro]] transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]] patrolled by a [[Batman]] using the ''Batman Beyond'' version of the costume. A version of the future of ''Batman Beyond'' made an appearance in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #21, as part of the new Multiverse in the wake of the ''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52'', and a ''Batman Beyond'' series is planned. In January 2015, DC published ''[[The Multiversity|The Multiversity Guidebook]]'' which revealed that a universe inspired by the DCAU is Earth-12 in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], and currently in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' era, while the Justice Lords Earth from the ''Justice League'' episode "A Better World" has also been added to the canon as Earth-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|penciller=Wyatt, Jake|title=Maps and Legends|volume=1|issue=1|date=January 28, 2015|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City|page=35|panel=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Daggett]] was adapted into the live-action film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' as a minor [[antagonist]] (renamed "John Daggett") and CEO of a rival company to Wayne Enterprises.

== The future of the DCAU ==
With the conclusion of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' animated series, Warner Bros has moved on to adapting new versions of the various DC comics properties rather than reviving the DCAU counterparts.

The last script written for DCAU continuity was titled ''Justice League: Worlds Collide''. This screenplay was created to bridge the several month gap between ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''. The draft was eventually adapted into the February 2010 film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', with the removal of any references specific to DCAU continuity, replacing Green Lantern John Stewart with Hal Jordan, and the casting of different voice actors than those of the DCAU.

In 2009, [[Bruce Timm]] was asked at a ToonZone forum if the DCAU will return in the future, and he stated this:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CrTCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA517&amp;lpg=PA517&amp;dq=I+very+much+appreciate+that+so+many+of+you+guys+have+so+much+love+for+the+old+series,+from+BTAS+through+JLU+(I+do+too)+--+but+frankly,+I+doubt+that+we%27ll+be+formally,+%22officially%22+doing+another+movie+or+TV+series+set+in+that+continuity+(...)+anything+is+possible,+so+conceivably+that+could+change+someday+--+instead+of+saying+%22THE+DCAU+IS+DEAD%22,+maybe+we+can+just+say+it%27s+in+a+state+of+suspended+animation+until+further+notice...?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmuYnKz-wF&amp;sig=G1RqXQ0vAvkRHKxZtjUBUqgUea4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbvurG0r7UAhVK5SYKHY50C8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Green Lantern History: An Unauthorized Guide to the DC Comic Book Series|publisher=google.com|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Kevin Conroy said work on the DCAU had stalled because the writers ran out of ideas for stories and believed stopping was best, as they did not want to "compromise on the quality of what they had and start creating kind of silly stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonomolo|first1=Cameron|title=Kevin Conroy Reveals The Real Reason They Stopped Making ‘Batman: The Animated Series’|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/05/27/kevin-conroy-batman-animted-series-stopped-making/|website=ComicBook.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018|date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics ===
The ''Batman Beyond'' comic series is a loose adaptation of the ''Batman Beyond'' franchise, intended to fit the character and storylines from the series into the mainstream DC continuity. The miniseries began in June 2010, under the title ''Future Evil''. In August 2010, the series was announced to continue following the completion of the first arc as an ongoing series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/08/28/batman-beyond-to-receive-an-ongoing-series/ |title=Batman Beyond To Receive An Ongoing Series |publisher=Inside Pulse |date=August 28, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; That series concluded alongside the entire line of ongoing monthly [[DC Comics]] superhero books during the 2011 revamp and relaunch, titled [[The New 52]].

''Superman Beyond'', a one-shot comic set in the same universe as ''Batman Beyond'', was released in 2011.

''Batman Beyond Unlimited'', a title chronicling the adventures of the future Justice League introduced in the DCAU, was released in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/11/14/dc-comics-launches-batman-beyond-unlimited/ |title=DC Comics Launches Batman Beyond Unlimited |publisher=DC Comics |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series published monthly triple-sized issues, containing three stories of Terry McGinnis, Clark "Cal" Kent, and the future Justice League Unlimited, respectively.&lt;ref name=june2013solicit&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL June 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/11080-dc-comics-full-june-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013|quote=...don't miss the epic conclusion of Superman Beyond!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Beyond Universe'' succeeded ''Unlimited'' in August 2013, condensing to double-monthly issues upon the elderly Superman's rejoining the future Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC Comics' FULL August 2013 Solicitations|url=http://www.newsarama.com/17794-dc-comics-full-august-2013-solicitations.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry McGinnis was the central figure in ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'' weekly series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.newsarama.com/21147-dc-reveals-creative-line-ups-for-september-s-futures-end-titles.html|title=DC Reveals Creative Line-Ups For September's Futures End Titles|last=Arrant|first=Chris|publisher=Newsarama|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015-2016, DC Comics and [[IDW Publishing]] released a jointly produced, six-issue miniseries comic titled ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Batman/TMNT]]'', where the ''New 52'' Batman encounters the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|IDW incarnation]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. The success of this miniseries inspired a similar crossover story, with Batman's DCAU incarnation meeting the ''Amazing Adventures'' comic version of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 CGI series']] Turtles. The concept was first announced in late July 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-classic-90s-cartoon-batman-is-teaming-up-with-the-n-1784128183 |title=The Classic '90s Cartoon Batman Is Teaming Up With the Ninja Turtles for a New Comic |publisher=io9.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is scheduled for a six-issue release starting November 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press |first=Official |url=http://batman-news.com/2016/07/22/animated-style-batmanteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-announced/|title=Animated-style Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover announced|publisher=Batman-news.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Dancing England''' was a series of showcase traditional dance concerts held at the Derby Assembly Rooms from 1979 to 1987. They were devised and curated by Phil Heaton and John Shaw, members of the Black Cap Sword Dancers, and two very notable characters on the Nottingham and Derby folk and dance scene of the 1970s. Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.

==Dancing England gone by==

In 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nut.net/articles/phil.php] The Nut on the Web. Retrieved on 2016-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; [[Morris dance|Cotswold Morris]], [[Rapper sword]], [[Long Sword dance|Longsword]], North West, [[Clog dance (British)|step clog dancing]], [[Border Morris|Border]], [[Molly dance|Molly]], and much more. There were also performances by [[Mummers play|mummers]] and [[Pace Egg play|Pace Eggers]], musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers|The Britannia Coconut Dancers]], [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance|Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers]] and the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.

==Daughter of Dancing England==

After Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.

==The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT)==

Dancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of [[Dancing England Rapper Tournament|DERT]] and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.

==The modern Dancing England Series, 2017 onwards==

2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019

'''Democracy and Desire''' (also ''Democracia y Deseo'') is an evolutionary exhibition project by artist [[Per Hüttner]] that develops as it travels. It has been shown in various public and private venues in [[Europe]] since November 2006. The project takes its inspiration from [[Zen Buddhist]] [[Koan]]s by pairing the incompatible words democracy and desire. The project investigates how the intellectual freedom of the mind is connected to, [[:wikt:inhibition|inhibited]] by [[social order]] and how the human body can both support and undermine the search for mental and [[social liberty]] through social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, "The Pain of Realising a Dream", p. 43, Reflejos culturales de Europa en España, The Embassy of Germany in Madrid, Madrid, 2007 {{ISBN|92-79-03260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project uses different forms of interactions with the public to change as it travels, drawing on Hüttner's previous experiences with exhibitions like [[I am a Curator]].&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preparatory research for the project, the artist was collaborating with a group of young creators called ''The Mob'' working within the framework of visual art research network [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/index.html Official Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; They set up an interactive website to collect material from the public and a wide variety of audiences. The website has since been closed, but much of the material that was gathered, is available in the catalogue that was published in conjunction with the second incarnation of the exhibition project.

==The First Public Incarnation==
On November 23, 2006 the first version of ''Democracy and Desire'' opened to the public at the gallery ''[[Vacio 9]]''&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/instInfo/inst/4946/lang/1 Vacio 9 on Artfacts.net]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The exhibition consisted solely of photographic work by Hüttner. But throughout the run of the exhibition, ''The Mob'' organized various public events that were open for audience participation; a night of performances with local and international artists like [[Julio Jara]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/91400/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Arean]], [[Nuria Mora]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuriamora.com/home_eng.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anita Wernström]], [[Jean-François Robardet]] and [[Marie Husson]]; video screenings with [[video art]] from around the globe and various semi-private training programs particularly related to [[gender]] issues.

The photographic work, that was also the point of departure for the public events, was clearly inspired by the life and work by [[Francisco Goya]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/painting/spanish-painting/goya-and-18th-century-painting/&lt;/ref&gt; both in expression and in content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artreview.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1474022%3ABlogPost%3A3003 Interview with Hüttner in Art Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Hüttner used the contradictory relationship between political powers and private desires that can be seen in many of the great master's paintings and created images that investigated the relationship between us as individual human beings and the interacting systems that surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;Pleins Phares, Fabienne Fulcheri, Musée National Collection Schlumpf, Mulhouse, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-7541-0250-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a text dedicated to the exhibition it is stated&lt;ref&gt;''Slashseconds'' issue 001/004, [[London]], [[UK]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" Some images in the series depict the traces of great [[Despotism|despots’]] megalomania or locations where books have been burned and innocent people have been killed. All the same, these places have witnessed marriages being consumed and great loves being born. Democracy and Desire acknowledges that the system is not the same as the people who perpetuate it. It asks to what degree our lives change when the political system changes and who are the people responsible for these changes? More importantly, however, it asks to what degree the system changes when the people within it change? When you grow as a human being, what does that mean for the powers in your [[town]], [[city]] or [[country]]?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The quote shows how clearly the artist is influenced by [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze’s]] assemblage theory and its impact on [[social ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]], [[Manuel DeLanda]], (Continuum, New York, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between individuals and social structure in the public space in Hüttner's earlier work became the impetus for Democracy and Desire. French writer [[Laurent Devèze]] has written about the 2006 exhibition ''Repetitive Time'' and the constant re-negotiation between the two becomes evident.:&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Repetitive Time'', 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall. Published by ''Göteborgs Konstmuseum''. {{ISBN|91-631-7127-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Little by little, by stopping us running around even for a short moment in time, we are forced to think about the past. Or rather to reflect on the whole paradigm of a memorial: an object built in a space specifically to remind us of something that happened at a moment in time. It is this that gives your [Hüttner's] altars such a strange intensity. They hold no indication to help us understand what they represent. Was a man killed here? Did something strange or extravagant take place here, something interesting enough to be remembered? The question is pertinent because, in our old cities overburdened with history, it is very likely that any and every point could be marked: here, a man died; here, a traffic accident occurred; here, a divorce was maybe agreed or a marriage proposal was accepted or some secret love affair was begun. It is a vertiginous thought: every point in the spaces that surround us has to be remembered; they are all worthy of it. There is not a single inch in the urban landscape that, if looked at through the prism of the past, should not be remembered. Which means that we could easily be surrounded by innumerable memorials, since everywhere we turn, something happened, something essential to someone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This goes hand in hand with [[Manuel DeLanda|Manuel DeLanda's]] definition of the [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The ontological status of any assemblage, inorganic, organic or social, is that of a unique singular, historically [[contingent]], individual. Although the term 'individual' has come to refer to individual persons, in its ontological sense it cannot be limited to that limit scale of reality. Much as biological species are not general categories of which [[animal]] and [[plant]] organisms are members, but larger-scale individual entities of which organisms are component parts, so larger social assemblages should be given the ontological status of individual entities: individual networks and coalitions; individual organizations and governments; individual cities and nation states. This ontological [[manœuevre]] allows us to assert that all these individual entities have an objective existence independently of our minds (or of our concepts of them) without any commitment to essences or reified generalities.&lt;ref&gt;[[A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]], [[Manuel DeLanda]], (Continuum, New York, 2006) p. 40, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Second Exhibition==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:per.huttner.Installation.RKIS.jpg|thumb|right|''Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Photography and drawing, installation view, Democracy and Desire II, The Romanian Cultural Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.]] --&gt;

In November 2007 the second version of ''Democracy and Desire'' opened at the ''[[Romanian Cultural Institute]]''&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.icr.ro/vechiulicr/filiale/evenimente_a.php?cod_filiala=28&amp;cod=419 RKIS website (Swedish only)]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and included public talks and discussions. For the exhibition the artist had created a series of drawings that were specially made to accompany each photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_8.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; The work on paper underlined the search for personal freedom of the mind in spite of social conventions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_9.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; by focusing on how [[imagination]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_10.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[creativity]] can liberate [[Human|human beings]]. The work is greatly influenced by Soviet/Russian literary critic [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“What is the character of these ornaments? They impressed the connoisseurs by the extremely fanciful, free and playful treatment of [[plant]], [[animal]] and [[human]] forms. These forms seemed interwoven as if given birth to each other. The borderlines that divide the kingdoms of nature in the normal world were boldly infringed. Neither was there the usual static presentation of reality. There was no longer the movement of finished forms, vegetable or animal, in a finished and stable world; instead the inner movement of being itself was expressed in the passing of one form into the other, in the ever incompleted character of being. This ornamental interplay revealed an extreme lightness and freedom of artistic fantasy, a gay, almost laughing, libertinage.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Rabelais and his World]], p. 32, 1984, [[Indiana University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The drawings presupposes a kind of timeless [[Carnival]] where the social roles were turned upside down. The work and also suggests, just like Bakhtin writes that the whole paradigm of [[temporality]] needs to be reformulated for humans to achieve freedom. But the images also connected back to Goya's work. Human violence was introduced as possible and darker form of liberator and thus raising issues of the relationship between victim and perpetrator. The artist writes in the catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Democracy and Desire'', 2007, 158 pages (A3) including 10 colour fold out pages. Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Romanian. Design by ''Åbäke''. Published by ''Vacio 9'' and ''The Romanian Cultural Institute''. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" We cannot continue to ignore the presence of our violent drives. Culture, conscience, and rationality cannot suppress the violence that is inscribed into our genes. Marlon Brando’s rendering of [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/&lt;/ref&gt; virtually incorporates all these principles or at least what can happen in an extreme situation when they have been repressed for too long. The final section of the film, which you might describe as a contemporary filmic paraphrase on Goya’s ''[[Disasters of War]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://goya.unizar.es/InfoGoya/Work/Desastres.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an incredibly forceful investigation to humanity’s relationship to violence. Kurtz is a violent madman and is on the one hand so appealing and on the other incredibly repulsive. His acceptance of his violent drives approaches or embraces insanity. He asks Willard, the man who will shortly kill him, 'Have you ever considered any real freedoms, freedoms from the opinion of others, even the opinions of yourself?' Those are crucial words from one ruthless warrior to another – but even more so for the artist. If the artist is not liberated from his or her inhibitions, it is also impossible for the audience to live a moment of freedom, since the humanness of the artist is veiled by doubts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner invited a group of young Swedish artists to create performances, film screenings and discussions to go along with the installation. After two months of preparations, the group declined the offer and opted to create a parallel exhibition at with the same title at [[Museet för Glömska]]&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.museetforglomska.se  Museet för Glömska website (Swedish only)]&lt;/ref&gt; (The museum of Forgetting) in the neighbouring town of [[Norrköping]].  The exhibition's [[curator]], [[Giorgiana Zachia]] responded by arranging a series of discussions at the gallery that included the artist and fellow curator [[Niclas Östlind]].

==Another Format of Democracy and Desire==
[[File:Per.huttner.Installation.freidrichsafen.jpg|thumb|right|''Membrane - Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and photography, installation view, Nothing to declare, 4th. Oberschwaben Contemporary Art Triennial, Friedrichshafen, Germany.]]

For ''Nothing to declare, 4th. [[Oberschwaben]] Contemporary Art Triennial''&lt;ref&gt;http://media.region-fn.de/triennale/web-content/11_Kuenstlerseiten/Huettner_Per.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Friedrichshafen]] in [[Germany]], English Curator [[Barnaby Drabble]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drabblesachs.org/notebook/D62E0F63-4372-4444-A828-62D4B3283EBA.html&lt;/ref&gt; asked the artist to develop the themes from ''Democracy and Desire’s'' second incarnation. The artist responded to this invitation by creating an installation using photos from the project along with new drawings. The photographs dialogue with the large mural drawings, further underlined the contradictions between the private and public realities depicted. They filtered out the individual's alienation to its own surroundings and the cultural clashes that we are faced with in contemporary life. The [[curator]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Drabble, ''Nothing to Declare'', Verlag für Moderne Kunst Nürneberg, {{ISBN|978-3-940748-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" In many of the works the artist appears to stage his own ‘otherness’ proposing the modern city and the thinking behind [[modernism]], as the backdrop against which this [[theatre]] of [[Social alienation|alienation]] is being played out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In keeping with the conceptual foundation for the project,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, "The Pain of Realising a Dream", p. 41, Reflejos culturales de Europa en España, The Embassy of Germany in Madrid, Madrid, 2007 {{ISBN|92-79-03260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created drawings that worked like contemporary, western [[shanshui]] paintings underlining the artist's interest in issues of alienation and inclusion. Trees drawn in the ink of modern, urban [[graffiti]] were metamorphosing into [[aeroplane]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/8.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; and then back into a wooden ladders in a stand-still [[morphing]] of traditional [[eastern art]]. The trees, connected to the mountains, paths and rivers depicted in the photographs. The clear references to traditional Chinese painting &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/6.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; underlines the fact that Hüttner's focus never strays far from the human mind and how philosophy shapes the formulation of our reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/7.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2008-09 Presentation==

[[File:per.huttner.Installation.abecita2.jpg|thumb|right|''Some other Histories of Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and vinyl lettering, installation view at Abecita Konstmuseum.]]

The relationship to Zen koans was developed in the third version of the project at ''[[Abecita Konstmuseum]]'' in [[Borås]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=28160&amp;int_modo=1&lt;/ref&gt; Here Hüttner returned to taking inspiration from contemporary ideas in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. He did so in a very free and creative way, just like he had done in his work from the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Elias Arnér and Per Hüttner,” Tom Sandqvist, Siksi, January 1993, Helsinki, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; By mixing theories from contemporary science with reflections on the life quality of our [[existence]], he delved deeper into paradox and the possibility to develop sense from the absurd. Hüttner imagined alternative pasts and through that alternative futures for democracy and desire in a [[mural painting]]. Poetic texts were connected to a band of monchrome colour fields that went around the circumference of the [[museum]].&lt;ref name="Realism p 2009"&gt;(Anti)Realism p.57-58, D'Ailleurs (Mobile), Mumero 1, Ecole Regional des Beaux Arts De Besançon, November 2009, {{ISBN|978-2-9518588-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the short texts include:  "The Democracy of Orgasm Act is enforced (Europe and Asia 2058-2122 AD)" and "A few hunters and gatherers discuss why their alpha male is such an idiot (Europe 8314 BC)." The visual impression of the work was very scientific and rational. But the content was filled with absurd and paradoxical suggestions related to potential future and past events related to democracy and desire respectively. The mural dialogued with the drawings and photographs and raised questions about time and temporality's role in paradoxes.

==Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy/Behavior Workshop for Idiots==
[[File:Love.in the.age.jpg|thumb|right|Installation view from Kunsthalle Luzern showing the second version of ''Some other Histories of Democracy and Desire'', 2009&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and vinyl lettering.]]
[[File:Idiot.workshop.dyd.low.jpg|thumb|right| Mari Brellochs, Kunstfabrik Flutgraben, Berlin; Fatos Üstek, curator, critic, London; ; Yane Calovski, Press-to-exit, Skopje and Hristina Ivanoska, Press-to-exit, Skopje during the Democracy and Desire performance during the Behavior Workshop for Idiots, Luzern; Switzerland May 2009]]

In May and June 2009 Lillian Fellman, director of Kunsthalle Luzern &lt;ref&gt;http://kunsthalleluzern.ch&lt;/ref&gt; organized “Behavior Workshop for Idiots” and the exhibition “Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.likeyou.com/en/node/12308
&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter Hüttner showed a new version of “Some Other Histories of Democracy and Desire”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunsthalleluzern.ch/downloads/Love_Pressetext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the texts had been both developed and translated into German. The approach to Zen Koans in this form was much less austere. The content was pushed towards a more blatant idiocy, humour and with a further shift to the carnivalesque and holding back the mysterious and nonsensical approach of the Buddhists. The contrast between the cool appearance of the installation and absurd content of the texts shows that the artist takes a more positive and proactive approach to the issues at hand. He moves further in the research to see how contemporary science and its outlook on temporality can be used to inspire life and art.&lt;ref name="Realism p 2009"/&gt;

The artists and curators: Fatos Ustek,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nowiswere.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Hristina Ivanoska,&lt;ref name="presstoexit.org.mk"&gt;http://www.presstoexit.org.mk/&lt;/ref&gt; Yane Calovski,&lt;ref name="presstoexit.org.mk"/&gt;  Mari Brellochs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunstfabrik.org/archives.html&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Heta,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stacion.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sixten Kai Nielsen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wooloo.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Rosengaard]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wooloo.org&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the workshop which dealt with many of the issues treated in the previous incarnations of Democracy and Desire. Hüttner also arranged a collaborative performance with the other participants. They were each given a copy of the catalogue of the exhibition and were asked to find alternative ways to read the catalogue while traversing the town and then climbing a mountain. Each participant found a different way to approach the task. Mari Brellochs for instance cut the entire catalogue into heart-shaped messages and gave them to people and left them in strategically chosen places in nature.

==La Caméra horloge, 2012==
Within the framework of the Nordic festival [[Les Boréales]] in [[Normandy]] in France, Per Hüttner showed a new incarnation of the project at [[Le Radar]] in [[Bayeux]].&lt;ref&gt;Les Boréales un festival du nord 2012, p.29, Le Centre régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie, Caen, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition brought together a large number of the original photographs with more recent video work thus moving the focus to [[temporality]] like the title suggests (The Timekeeping Camera). In the press release the curator underlines that the core questions of Democracy and Desire remain and yet find that they are reformulated with more focus on time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.le-radar.fr/programmation/expositions-passeesThe Gallery's official Website (French only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"While destabilizing the eye, the artist opens for other interpretations when he compares the title of the exhibition to a [[Koan]], a deliberately confusing formula for the enlightenment of [[Zen]] monks. The observer is invited to take on a challenge, to move beyond appearances to reach a deeper awareness of the world by means of exploring the photographs on display. Per Hüttner voluntarily invites the visitor to update his or her subjectivity by discovering the conditions of any perception of reality. Time and space become measurement standards that allow the personal to aid to appreciate the beauty of the changing the world around them. Yet his photographs reveal the fleetingness and infinite in [[paradox]]. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]], feelings and [[reason]] coexist, but not without friction. Indeed his photographs raise questions of enigmatic and spiritual nature while at the same time investigating scientific concepts such as [[space-time continuum]] and [[quantum physics]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication==

A catalogue with the title ''Per Hüttner: Democracy and Desire'' designed by international design group ''Åbäke''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myspace.com/abakespace&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2007. It uses the special typeface developed by [[Thomas Moore]] for his ''[[Utopia]]'' on the cover as well in the pages of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Democracy and Desire'', 2007, 158 pages (A3) including 10 colour fold out pages. Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Romanian. Design by ''Åbäke''. Published by ''Vacio 9'' and ''The Rumanian Cultural Institute''. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Which was developed from a collaboration with [[Dent-de-Leone]] and [[Aurélien Froment]] where the entire 1516 [[novel]] is set in the typeface developed by Moore &lt;ref&gt;http://abake.fr/_/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Utopiainutopia.png&lt;/ref&gt; and thus virtually impossible to read.&lt;ref&gt;http://dentdeleone.co.nz/books/utopia-utopia?page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digiglyph''' is the final stage of a printmaking process that combines traditional [[monoprinting]] techniques with digital manipulation and outsourcing. A digiglyph differs from a traditional [[monoprint]] or [[monotype]] in that it uses a completed hand-drawn monoprint/monotype as the first stage of a final piece. The monoprint is scanned, and then its composition is further manipulated using computer software, before being reprinted and hand embellished. Digital digiglyph files can be used to produce editions; however, hand embellishment of each print transforms the digiglyph into a one-of-a-kind image.

== Technique ==
Starting out as a traditional monoprint, the digiglyph departs from hand work by using computer software to scan the completed print and layer in conceptually related material. The completed digital composition is exported and the finished digital print is then embellished by hand, creating a unique print.

'''Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park''' (or '''Earl W. Brydges State Artpark''') is a {{convert|108|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[state park]]&lt;ref name=RIoG_ParkStats/&gt; located in the [[Lewiston, New York|Village of Lewiston]] in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The park, which is officially named after former New York State Senator [[Earl Brydges]], is generally referred to as '''Artpark'''. The park overlooks the [[Niagara Gorge]].&lt;ref name=National_Heritage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverniagara.org/explore/plan-your-trip/town-of-lewiston-village-of-lewiston/artpark-state-park/ |title=Artpark State Park |website=Niagara Falls National Heritage Area |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Park description==

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

[[File:Eiffel trocadero i.jpg|thumb|The [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, which inspired the series]]
The '''''Eiffel Tower''''' series of [[Robert Delaunay]] (1885 – 1941) is a cycle of paintings and drawings of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. Its main sequence was created between 1909 and 1912, with additional works added up to 1928. The series is considered the most prominent art depicting the iconic Paris tower as well as the most prominent work of Delaunay.

The series was painted in an emerging [[Orphism (art)|Orphist]] style, an art movement co-founded by Robert and [[Sonia Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]] that added bright colors and increased abstraction to [[Cubism]]. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series sits chronologically and stylistically between the artist's ''[[Saint-Séverin, Paris|Saint-Séverin]]'' series and ''Windows'' series.

==Legacy==
Delaunay's Eiffel Tower series is evoked in [[architectural painting]]s of other iconic buildings by his contemporary, the New York artist [[John Marin]], in his ''Woolworth Building, No. 31'' of 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Futurism in Arts and Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o2t9VviqFtkC&amp;pg=PA233|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 2000-01-01|isbn = 9783110156812|language = en|page = 233|last = Panzera|first = Lisa|chapter = Italian Futurism and Avant-Garde Painting in the United States|editor-last = Berghaus|editor-first = Günther}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the Ontario artist [[Greg Curnoe]]'s ''[[CN Tower]]'' series of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greg Curnoe: A Proposed Referendum and Five Series|url = http://ccca.concordia.ca/resources/searches/event_detail.html?languagePref=en&amp;vk=6921|website = The CCCA Canadian Art Database|accessdate = 2015-11-19|year = 1978|publisher = [[Canadian Art (magazine)|artscanada]]|last = Barrio|first = Jose L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1913 artist's book ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'', a collaborative work between [[Sonia Delaunay]] and the poet [[Blaise Cendrars]], forms an epic narrative of a Trans-Siberian Railway journey that concludes in Paris at a Simultanist Eiffel Tower. They had announced a plan to sell 150 copies of the book, which would equal in height the Tower itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925: How a Radical Idea Changed Modern Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2NNb9bUe4bIC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher = The Museum of Modern Art|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9780870708282|language = en|last = Affron|page = 83|editor-first = Leah|editor-last = Affron|chapter = Contrasts of Colors, Contrasts of Words|first = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Russian film director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s appreciation of Delaunay's work informed his [[Soviet montage theory]], as he imagined developing cinematically  "a dynamic fusion of a series, moving past the spectator, of those hundred views of the Eiffel Tower" rather than a "summation within a single canvas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On John Berger: Telling Stories|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RbC8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301|publisher = Brill Rodopi|date = 2015-10-12|isbn = 9789004308114|language = en|page = 301|last = Neat|first = Timothy|chapter = Invisible Cinema: John Berger, Play Me Something, and Walk Me Home|editor-last = Hertel|editor-first = Ralf|editor-last2 = Malcolm|editor-first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fairy ring on a suburban lawn 100 1851.jpg|thumb|A fairy ring (possibly ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'') on a suburban lawn in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''fairy ring''', also known as '''fairy circle''', '''elf circle''', '''elf ring'''&lt;ref&gt;'Chambers's Edinburgh journal, Volume 9'' by William Chambers, Robert Chamber, W. Orr, 1841, Page. 55&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pixie ring''', is a naturally occurring ring or arc of [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name=WIF&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Fungus?|website=Australian National Botanic Gardens|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/what-is-fungus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings may grow to over {{convert|10|m}} in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in [[forest]]ed areas, but also appear in [[grassland]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Fairy Ring |volume=10 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]s (fungal spore pods) in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus [[mycelium]] is present in the ring or arc underneath.

[[Fairy]] rings are the subject of much [[folklore]] and myth worldwide—particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune.

==Genesis==
The [[mycelium]] of a [[fungus]] growing in the ground absorbs nutrients by secretion of [[enzyme]]s from the tips of the [[hyphae]] (threads making up the mycelium).&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; This breaks down larger molecules in the soil into smaller molecules that are then absorbed through the walls of the hyphae near their growing tips.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; The mycelium will move outward from the center, and when the nutrients in the center are exhausted, the center dies, thereby forming a living ring, from which the fairy ring arises.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt;

There are two theories regarding the process involved in creating fairy rings. One states that the fairy ring is begun by a [[spore]] from the sporocarpus. The underground presence of the fungus can also cause withering or varying colour or growth of the grass above. The second theory, which is presented in the investigations of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] scientists on the ''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' species, shows that fairy rings could be established by connecting neighbouring oval [[Genet (biology)|genet]]s of these mushrooms. If they make an arc or a ring, they continuously grow about the centre of this object.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Necrotic or rapid growth zones==
[[File:FairyRingSchoolField.jpg|thumb|Two fairy rings marked by uneven grass growth (small one in foreground, much bigger one in background). The lush green arcs of grass betray the presence of underground fungal [[mycelium|mycelia]].]]
[[File:Hexenring auf einer Wiese, Sperrberg, Niedergailbach.JPG|thumb|Fairy ring on a meadow]]
One of the manifestations of fairy ring growth is a necrotic zone—an area in which grass or other plant life has withered or died. These zones are caused by the mycelia which, during a very dry year, coat the roots of grasses and other herbs in [[meadow]]s. After some time they are removed by [[biotic factor]]s from the ground, at which stage a zone on the surface soil becomes visible. Patterns other than the basic ring or arc are also possible: circles, doubled arcs, sickle-shaped arcs, and other complicated formations are also formed by this process.  Fungi can deplete the soil of readily available nutrients such as [[nitrogen]], causing plants growing within the circle to be stressed which leads to plant discoloration.  Some fungi also produce chemicals which act like [[plant hormone|hormones]] called [[gibberellin]]s, which affect plant growth, causing rapid luxuriant growth.

Long-term observations of fairy rings on [[Bell Hill, Dorset|Shillingstone Hill]] in Dorset, England, further suggested that the cycle depended on the continuous presence of rabbits. Chalky soils on higher elevations in the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England used to support many meadow-type fairy rings. Rabbits crop grass very short in open areas and produce nitrogen-rich droppings. Mushrooms need more soil nitrogen than grass does. A ring can start from only a few spores from which the mycelium develops; the fruiting bodies of the mushrooms only appearing later, when sufficient mycelial mass has been generated to support them. Subsequent generations of fungi grow only outwards, because the parent generations have depleted their local nitrogen levels. Meanwhile, rabbits keep cropping the grass, but do not eat the fungi, allowing them to grow through their competition to tower, relatively, above the grass. By the time a circle of mushrooms reaches about {{convert|6|m}} in diameter, rabbit droppings have replenished the nitrogen levels near the centre of the circle, and a secondary ring may start to grow inside the first. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Soil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit (''[[Clitocybe nuda]]'') fairy ring under Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen [[Halogenation|halogenated]] low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.&lt;ref name=hjelm96/&gt;

== Types ==
There are two generally recognised types of fairy ring fungus. Those found in the woods are called ''tethered'', because they are formed by [[mycorrhizal]] fungi living in [[symbiosis]] with trees. Meadow fairy rings are called ''free'', because they are not connected with other organisms. These mushrooms are [[saprotrophic]].
The effects on the grass depend on the type of fungus that is growing; when ''[[Calvatia cyathiformis]]'' is growing in the area grass will grow more abundantly; however, ''[[Leucopaxillus giganteus]]'' will cause the grass to wither.&lt;ref&gt;Böttcher, Helmuth M. ''Miracle Drugs'' William Henemann Ltd. London 1963 p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral tradition and folklore ===
[[File:Plucked from the Fairy Circle.png|thumb|"Plucked from the Fairy Circle"&lt;br /&gt;A man saves his friend from the grip of a fairy ring]]
A great deal of folklore surrounds fairy rings.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} Their names in European languages often allude to supernatural origins; they are known as ''ronds de sorcières'' ("witches' circles") in French, and ''Hexenringe'' ("witches' rings") in German.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} In German tradition, fairy rings were thought to mark the site of witches' dancing on [[Walpurgis Night]],{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} and Dutch superstition claimed that the circles show where the [[Devil]] set his milk churn. In [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], folklore attributed fairy rings to the fiery tails of flying dragons; once a dragon had created such a circle, nothing but toadstools could grow there for seven years. European superstitions routinely warned against entering a fairy ring. French tradition reported that fairy rings were guarded by giant bug-eyed toads that cursed those who violated the circles. In other parts of Europe, entering a fairy ring would result in the loss of an eye.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} Fairy rings are associated with diminutive spirits in the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=12}}

[[Western Europe]]an traditions, including English, Scandinavian and Celtic, claimed that fairy rings are the result of [[elf|elves]] or [[fairy|fairies]] dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the mediæval period; The [[Middle English]] term ''elferingewort'' ("elf-ring"), meaning "a ring of daisies caused by elves' dancing" dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History of the Goths'' (1628), [[Olaus Magnus]] makes this connection, saying that fairy rings are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} British folklorist [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]] noted that in Scandinavia in the early 20th century, beliefs persisted that fairy rings (''elfdans'') arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an ''elfdans'' might allow the interloper to see the elves—although this was not guaranteed—it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=81}}&lt;ref&gt;The term for ''fairy ring'' in modern Norwegian is ''alvedans''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fairy ring on Iceland.jpg|thumb|Fairy rings in moss in Iceland]]
The [[folklore]]s of  [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] contain a wealth of fairy lore, including the idea from which fairy rings take their name: the phenomena result from the dancing of fairies.&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"&gt;Ripley and Dana 402.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century Wales, where the rings are known as ''cylch y Tylwyth Teg'', fairies were almost invariably described as dancing in a group when encountered,&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"&gt;Sikes 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Scotland and Wales in the late 20th century, stories about fairy rings were still common;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyndaf 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"&gt;Bennett 110.&lt;/ref&gt; some Welshmen even claimed to have joined a fairy dance.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"&gt;Gwyndaf 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian folklorists regarded fairies and witches as related, based in part on the idea that both were believed to dance in circles.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 175.&lt;/ref&gt; These revels are particularly associated with moonlit nights, the rings only becoming visible to mortals the following morning.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=297}}&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Local variants add other details. An early 20th-century Irish tradition says that fairies enjoy dancing around the [[Crataegus|hawthorn tree]] so that fairy rings often centre on one.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 39.&lt;/ref&gt; One resident of [[Balquhidder]], Scotland, said that the fairies sit on the mushrooms and use them as dinnertables,&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"/&gt; and a Welsh woman claimed that fairies used the mushrooms as parasols and umbrellas.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; [[Olaus Magnus]] in ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'' wrote that the brightness of the fairy ring comes not from the dancing of the fairies, who harm it with their feet, but from [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]], who refreshes the grass.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; A Devon legend says that a black hen and chickens sometimes appear at dusk in a large fairy ring on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxhead, J. R. W., ''The Devil in Devon'', p. 39-40. Quoted in Briggs 328.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh and Manx variant current in the 1960s removes dancing from the picture and claims that fairy rings spring up over an underground fairy village.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"&gt;Radford and Radford 157.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations have become linked to specific sites. For example, "The Pixies' Church" was a rock formation in Dartmoor surrounded by a fairy ring,&lt;ref&gt;Bray 149.&lt;/ref&gt; and a stone circle tops [[Cader Idris]] in northern Wales, believed to be a popular spot for fairy dances. Guernsey Fairy Ring is also a popular spot for fairie dancing and known for having evil fairies living there.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many folk beliefs generally paint fairy rings as dangerous places, best avoided.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"&gt;Cielo 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Sikes traces these stories of people trespassing into forbidden territory and being punished for it to the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche and Eros]]. In it, Psyche is forbidden to view her lover, and when she does so, her palace disappears and she is left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Superstition calls fairy circles sacred and warns against violating them lest the interloper (such as a farmer with a plough) anger the fairies and be [[curse]]d.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheviot 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bray 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an Irish legend recorded by [[Lady Wilde|Wilde]], a farmer builds a barn on a fairy ring despite the protests of his neighbours. He is struck senseless one night, and a local "fairy doctor" breaks the curse. The farmer says that he dreamed that he must destroy the barn.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Even collecting dew from the grass or flowers of a fairy ring can bring bad luck. Destroying a fairy ring is unlucky and fruitless; superstition says it will just grow back.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;

A traditional Scottish rhyme sums up the danger of such places:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;He wha tills the fairies' green
Nae luck again shall hae :
And he wha spills the fairies' ring
Betide him want and wae.
For weirdless days and weary nights
Are his till his deein' day.
But he wha gaes by the fairy ring,
Nae dule nor pine shall see,
And he wha cleans the fairy ring
An easy death shall dee.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Popular Rhymes'', 324; quoted in McPherson 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Numerous legends focus on mortals entering a fairy ring—and the consequences. One superstition is that anyone who steps into an empty fairy ring will die at a young age.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"&gt;Franklin 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A 20th-century tradition from [[Somerset]] calls the fairy ring a "galley-trap" and says that a murderer or thief who walks in the ring will be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs and Tongue 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, someone who violates a fairy perimeter becomes invisible to mortals outside and may find it impossible to leave the circle. Often, the fairies force the mortal to dance to the point of exhaustion, death, or madness.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Welsh tales, fairies actively try to lure mortals into their circles to dance with them.&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"/&gt; A tale from the [[Cambrian Mountains]] of Wales, current in the 19th century, describes a mortal's encounter with a fairy ring:

{{quote|... he saw the Tylwyth Teg, in appearance like tiny soldiers, dancing in a ring. He set out for the scene of revelry, and soon drew near the ring where, in a gay company of males and females, they were footing it to the music of the harp. Never had he seen such handsome people, nor any so enchantingly cheerful. They beckoned him with laughing faces to join them as they leaned backward almost falling, whirling round and round with joined hands. Those who were dancing never swerved from the perfect circle; but some were clambering over the old cromlech, and others chasing each other with surprising swiftness and the greatest glee. Still others rode about on small white horses of the most beautiful form&amp;nbsp;... All this was in silence, for the shepherd could not hear the harps, though he saw them. But now he drew nearer to the circle, and finally ventured to put his foot in the magic ring. The instant he did this, his ears were charmed with strains of the most melodious music he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Howells, W. (1831). ''Cambrian Superstitions'', p. 148; translated in Sikes 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Entering the ring on [[May Eve]] or [[Halloween]] night was especially dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; One source near Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a tributary of the Dwyfach, tells of a shepherd accidentally disturbing a ring of rushes where fairies are preparing to dance; they capture him and hold him captive, and he even marries one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants from Scotland recorded by [[Edwin Sidney Hartland]] in 1891, the ring is replaced by a cavern or an old mill.&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 165-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from a fairy ring often requires outside intervention. A tactic from early 20th-century Wales is to cast wild [[marjoram]] and [[thyme]] into the circle and befuddle the fairies;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan and Hartland 97.&lt;/ref&gt; another asks the rescuer to touch the victim with iron.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"&gt;Hartland 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories require that the enchanted victim simply be plucked out by someone on the outside,&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"&gt;Sikes 75.&lt;/ref&gt; although even this can be difficult: A farmer in a tale from the [[Llangollen]] region has to tie a rope around himself and enlist four men to pull him from the circle as he goes in to save his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk methods rely on Christian faith to break the enchantment: a stick from a [[rowan]] tree (thought to be the wood from which the cross of [[Jesus Christ]] was built) can break the curse,&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; as can a simple phrase such as "what, in Heaven's name", as in a 19th-century tale from [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"&gt;Sikes 72.&lt;/ref&gt; A common element to these recoveries is that the rescuer must wait a year and a day from when the victim entered the ring.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"/&gt;

Mortals who have danced with the fairies are rarely safe after being saved from their enthrallment. Often, they find that what seemed to be but a brief foray into fairyland was indeed much longer in the mortal realm, possibly weeks or years.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 166-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The person rescued from the fairy ring may have no memory of their encounter with the sprites, as in a story from Anglesea recorded in 1891.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"&gt;Hartland 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In most tales, the saved interlopers face a grim fate. For example, in a legend from [[Carmarthenshire]], recorded by Sikes, a man is rescued from a fairy ring only to crumble to dust.&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"/&gt; In a tale from Mathavarn, Llanwrin Parish, a fairy-ring survivor moulders away when he eats his first bite of food.&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"/&gt; Another vulnerability seems to be iron; in a tale from the [[Aberystwyth]] region, a touch from the metal causes a rescued woman to disappear.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"/&gt;

Some legends assert that the only safe way to investigate a fairy ring is to run around it nine times. This affords the ability to hear the fairies dancing and frolicking underground.&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"/&gt; According to a 20th-century tradition of [[Northumberland]], this must be done under a full moon, and the runner must travel in the direction of the sun; to go [[widdershins]] allows the fairies to place the runner under their sway. To circle the ring a tenth time is foolhardy and dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; Keightley recorded a similar tradition from [[Northumberland]] in 1905: "The children constantly run this number [nine times], but nothing will induce them to venture a tenth run."{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=310}} A story from early 20th century England says that a mortal can see the sprites without fear if a friend places a foot on that of the person stepping beyond the circle's perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1406.&lt;/ref&gt; Another superstition says that wearing a hat backwards can confuse the fairies and prevent them from pulling the wearer into their ring.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they have strong associations with doom, some legends paint fairy circles as places of fertility and fortune. Welsh folk belief is that mountain sheep that eat the grass of a fairy ring flourish, and that crops sown from such a place will prove more bountiful than those from normal land.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} A folk belief recorded in the ''Athenian Oracle'' claims that a house built on a fairy circle will bring prosperity to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a legend from Pont y Wern says that in the 13th or 14th century, the inhabitants of the town of Corwrion watched fairies dancing in a ring around a [[glow worm]] every Sunday after church at a place called Pen y Bonc. They even joined the sprites in their revels. The legend survives in a rhyme: "With the fairies nimbly dancing round / The glow-worm on the Rising Ground."&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh tale recorded by Rhys in 1901 tells of a man who supposedly lived on the side of the [[Berwyn range|Berwyn]], above Cwm Pennant, in the early 19th century. The man destroyed a nest of [[rook (bird)|rook]]s in a tree surrounded by a fairy ring. In gratitude, the fairies gave him a half crown every day but stopped when he told his friends, "for he had broken the rule of the fair folks by making their liberality known".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, fairy boons are not without their curses, and tales often tell of the sprites exacting their revenge.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}}

Fairy rings have featured in the works of European authors, playwrights, and artists since the 13th century. In his [[Arthurian romance]] ''Meraugis de Portlesguez'', [[Raoul de Houdenc]] describes a scene clearly derived from Celtic fairy-ring lore: The title character visits the Château des Caroles and sees a circle of women and a knight dancing around a pine in the castle courtyard. Meraugis is unable to fight the intense desire to join in, thus freeing the previous knight from the spell. Meraugis is helpless to leave the dance until, ten weeks later, another knight joins it and frees him.&lt;ref&gt;Paton 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy circles feature in works by several [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] poets and playwrights. [[William Shakespeare]] alludes to them in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Act II, Scene I&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"&gt;Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And I serve the fairy queen, / To dew her orbs upon the green" and "To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind"),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Act II, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Tempest]]'', Act V, Scene I:&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"/&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''The Tempest'', Act V, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Shakespeare's contemporary [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]] speaks of fairy rings in his ''Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry'' (1638), and [[Michael Drayton]] describes one in ''Nymphidia: The Court of Fairy'':&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"/&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And in their courses make that round
In meadows and in marshes found,
Of them so called the Fairy Ground,
{{in5|3}}Of which they have the keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Drayton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Fairy imagery became especially popular in the [[Victorian era]]. [[Thomas Hardy]] uses a fairy ring as a symbol of lost love in ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886); the character Michael Henchard passes a fairy ring and remembers that he last saw his wife Susan there when he sold her to a sailor in a drunken rage.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poets who have referred to fairy rings in their works include [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Eliza Cook]], [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Gerald Massey]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;See Browning, "The Deserted Garden"; Cook, "'Don't You Remember?'"; Hawker, "The Fairy Vision" and "Chorus of Fairies"; Hemans, "Canto III"; Massey, "Love's Fairy-ring"; and Tennyson, "Guinevere".&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. H. Cummings]] composed the cantata ''The Fairy Ring'', and [[William Butler Yeats]] wrote of them in ''[[The Land of Heart's Desire]]'' (1894).&lt;ref&gt;Skelton 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
Fairy circles have appeared in European artwork since at least the 18th century. For example, [[William Blake]] painted ''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'', depicting a scene from Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', around 1785,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Maclise]] painted ''Faun and the Fairies'' around 1834. Images of fairies dancing in circles became a favourite trope of [[fairy painting|painters]] in the Victorian period. On the one hand, artists were genuinely interested in the culture such imagery represented, and on the other, fairies could be depicted as titillating nudes and semi-nudes without offending [[Victorian morality|Victorian mores]], which made them a popular subject of art collectors. Examples of Victorian fairy-ring paintings include ''Come unto these Yellow Sands'' (1842) by [[Richard Dadd]] and ''Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon'' (1847) by [[Joseph Noel Paton]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver 230, note 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Academy in Rome''' ({{lang-fr|Académie de France à Rome}}) is an Academy located in the [[Villa Medici]], within the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], on the [[Pincio]] (Pincian Hill) in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The Academy was founded at the [[Palazzo Capranica]] in 1666 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under the direction of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Charles Le Brun]] and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The Academy was from the 17th to 19th centuries the culmination of study for select French artists who, having won the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]] (Rome Prize), were honored with a 3, 4 or 5-year scholarship (depending on the art discipline they followed) in the Eternal City for the purpose of the study of art and architecture.  Such scholars were and are known as ''pensionnaires de l'Académie'' (Academy pensioners). One recipient of the scholarship in the 17th century was [[Pierre Le Gros the Younger]].

The Academy was housed in the Palazzo Capranica until 1737, and then in the [[Palazzo Mancini]] from 1737 to 1793. In 1803 [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] moved it to the Villa Medici, with the intention of perpetuating an institution once threatened by the [[French Revolution]] and, thus, of retaining for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of the Antiquity or the Renaissance and send back to Paris their "envois de Rome", the results of  the inspiration they had gained in Rome. These "envois" were annual works, sent to Paris to be judged, and were a compulsory requirement for all the pensionaries.

[[File:Portrait of Merry-Joseph Blondel.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Prix de Rome winner and fellow student [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]] in front of the Villa Medici in 1809, by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]]]
At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state and had to be renovated to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. The competition was interrupted during the first World War, and Mussolini confiscated the villa in 1941, forcing the academy of France in Rome to withdraw to [[Nice]] then to [[Fontainebleau]] until 1945. The competition and Prix de Rome were eliminated in 1968 by [[André Malraux]] (the last Grand Prix for architecture came to an end as early as 1967, the events of 1968 preventing its continuation).&lt;ref&gt;Malraux had already once envisioned, unsuccessfully, the suppression of the Prix de Rome competition in 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and the [[Institut de France]] then lost their guardianship of the Villa Medici to the Ministry of the Culture and the State.&lt;ref&gt;The Institut de France reacted against this as early as 1975, while organizing each year the competition for the Académie des Beaux-Arts's Grand Prix of Architecture that still exists today.&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, the boarders no longer belonged solely to the traditional disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, medal-engraving, precious-stone engraving, musical composition) but also to new or previously neglected artistic fields (art history, archaeology, literature, stagecraft, photography, movies, video, [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]], [[writing]] and even cookery). These artists-in-residence are known as ''pensionnaires.'' The French word ‘pension’ refers to the room &amp; board these, generally young and promising, artists receive. The artists are no longer recruited by a competition but by application, and their stays vary from six to eighteen months and even, more rarely, two years.

Between 1961 and 1967, the artist [[Balthus]], then at the head of the Academy, carried out a vast restoration campaign of the palace and its gardens, providing them with modern equipment. Balthus participated "hands on" in all the phases of the construction. Where the historic décor had disappeared, Balthus proposed personal alternatives. He invented a décor that was a homage to the past and, at the same time,  radically contemporary: The mysterious melancholic decor he created for Villa Medici has become, in turn, historic and was undergoing an important restoration campaign in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villamedici.it/en/villa-medici/history/from-1803-to-today/|title=Villa medici|website=www.villamedici.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued under the direction of director, [[Richard Peduzzi]], and the Villa Medici resumed organizing exhibitions and shows created by its artists in residence.

Under director [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] the Academy opened up its guest rooms to the general public at times when they are not used by pensionnaires or other official guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/07/italy-villa-medici.html|title=Italy: The Villa Medici B&amp;B- the poshest Bed &amp; Breakfast in Rome|website=www.minorsights.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Germigny-des-Prés''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Loiret]] [[Departments of France|department]] in north-central [[France]].

==The Oratory==
The oratory at Germigny-des-Prés (Loiret, Orléanais) was built by Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]] in 806 as part of his palace complex within the Gallo-Roman villa in Germaniacus. Theodulf, who was also abbot of the neighboring monastery of [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]], was a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] and one of the most celebrated men of letters in the [[Carolingian Empire]] court of [[Charlemagne]]. The [[Carolingian architecture]] of his palace complex at Germigny-des-Prés was in a general sense modelled on Charlemagne's [[Palace of Aachen]]. All except the oratory was destroyed by the [[Viking]]s within a century of construction.

As reconstructed by [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulf]] in 806, the oratory took the form of a rough square with single apses in the middle of the north, south, and west sides, and three apses on the east side. Internally, the space took the form of a [[Greek cross]]: a high central tower filled the central bay, [[barrel vault]]s extended off in the north, south, east, and west bays, while in the corner bays there were low domes carried on [[squinch]]es. This plan type was later to become standard in [[Byzantine architecture]].

Horseshoe arches are used throughout the church, an unusual element in French architecture derived, in this case, from the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] practices of Theodulf's native [[Spain]]. The central [[apse]] of the east contains a rich and complex mosaic showing two cherubim above the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Below his mosaic, Theodulf placed an inscription that occupies two lines:
::As you gaze upon the holy propitiatorium and Cherubim, beholder,
::And see the shimmering of the Ark of God's covenant,
::Perceiving these things, and prepared to beset the Thunderer with prayers,
::Add, I beg you, Theodulf's name to your invocations.'

===History===
[[Odo of Metz]], an Armenian architect, built the Germigny des Prés in 806-811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Ching|title=A global history of architecture|year=2007|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louis|first=Victor|title=The complete guide to the Soviet Union|year=1976|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josef Strzygowski]] and [[Alexander Sahinian]], the church was possibly influenced by the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], the mother church of Armenia.&lt;ref name="csufresno"&gt;{{cite web|title=Etchmiadzin |url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/iaa_architecture/etchmiadzin.htm |publisher=Armenian Studies Program [[California State University, Fresno]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623214051/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/iaa_architecture/etchmiadzin.htm |archivedate=23 June 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was consecrated on 3 January 806, dedicated to SS.Geneviève and Germain. Damaged by fire before 854, it became part of a priory in 1067, and a parish church in the 13th century. The original circular plan was augmented with a [[nave]] in the 15-16th century, which involved the demolition of the Western abside. The nave was extended to the west in the 19th century, and a bell-tower erected. The church was classified as a ''monument historique'' in 1840 and restoration commenced in 1867.

The most ancient part of the existing church is the square building which surrounds the altar. Although often referred to as a 'Greek Cross' church, this building does not really fall into this category, as it has no projecting 'arms' or [[transept]]s, only a single [[apse]] on three sides, and a triple apse to the 'east' (the church is not aligned to the compass points). The triple apse would not appear to have been mirrored to the 'west' where the entrance was and is to be found, subsequent alteration has made it impossible to determine whether there was originally a [[narthex]].

The church is also architecturally quite distinct from the Palatine chapel in Aachen, and from S. Vitale in Ravenna – two buildings upon which it is often claimed that SS.Geneviève &amp; Germain is modelled – in that it is square rather than round, has exterior apses and is constructed differently.  This is rather a rare survival of a very early form of Western European church, pre-dating and perhaps contributing to the development of the Romanesque which forms the majority of ancient churches in France and, indeed, in Western Europe.

The great treasure of the church is the mosaic of the Ark of the Covenant, on the ceiling of the apse. This mosaic is the only surviving Byzantine mosaic in France, although traces of mosaics elsewhere on the roof indicate that it was part of a wider decorative scheme. The mosaic owes its preservation to being plastered over at the time of the French Revolution; it was rediscovered in the middle of the 19th century.
The mosaic is one of the few remaining artworks from the period of the [[Iconoclasm]] which convulsed the Eastern Church during the 8th &amp; 9th centuries, but which also impacted on Western Christendom. Traditionally, the place occupied by this mosaic was reserved for images of the Virgin Mary, enthroned as Queen Of Heaven, with the Christ child on her knee, and with an attendant angel on either side. These angels pointed out the divine status of the figures between them.

The artist working at Germigny (who was obviously au fait with Byzantine practice, if not actually Greek himself) has replaced the portrait of the Virgin, Mother of Christ, with an equivalent but symbolic representation. The Ark of the Covenant contains ‘manna’, the miraculous bread given from Heaven to the Israelites in the desert; this was interpreted as a prefiguration of the Virgin, who bears Christ, the Holy Bread.
The mosaicist, and Théodulf d'Orléans, seem to have held a middle course, balanced between extreme iconoclasm and the partisans of images such as [[John of Damascus]]. This moderate position is exactly that which the theologians appointed by Charlemagne in the Council of Frankfurt (794) decided upon.

The '''Gniezno Doors''' ({{lang-pl|Drzwi Gnieźnieńskie}}) are a pair of [[bronze]] doors at the entrance to [[Gniezno Cathedral]] in [[Gniezno]], [[Poland]], a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building which the doors pre-date, having been carried over from an earlier building. They are decorated with eighteen scenes in [[bas-relief]] from the life of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]], or Wojciech in Polish, whose remains had been bought for their weight in gold (shown in scene 16), and carried back to the cathedral and set up in a [[shrine]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archidiecezja.pl Archdiocese of Gniezno]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Irena Daniec ''The Message of Faith and Symbol in European Medieval Bronze Church Doors,'' Chapter Two: ''Man, Flora and Fauna in the Bronze Door of the Gniezno Cathedral in Poland'', p. 23-66, Danbury, CT, Rutledge Books, Inc. (1999) {{ISBN|1-887750-95-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made in about 1175 during the reign of [[Mieszko III the Old]] and are one of the most significant works of [[Romanesque art]] in [[Culture of medieval Poland|Poland]].

==Placing the origin of the doors==
Locating the origin of the doors has been the subject of much discussion. It is clear that their style derives from the Mosan area in modern [[Belgium]] and France. Their place of manufacture has been argued to be [[Hildesheim]] (home of the famous [[Bernward Doors]] of about 1015), [[Bohemia]], [[Flanders]] (perhaps [[Liège|Liege]]), or locally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]]'s sources in [[God's Playground]], p. 65, say Flanders about 1175. For Bohemia, see next note.&lt;/ref&gt; Swartzenski says "design and wax model, Liege (?)" but "cast in Gniezno (?)", "soon after 1127", but this date now seems very much a minority view - it was the year when St Adalbert's head was "recovered", not having been with the initial batch of relics.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski, p.59 (note on Pl 116). [[Grove Art]], "Romanesque, §VI: Metalwork" say "c. 1135, perhaps perhaps Bohemia", and "probably c. 1170" by imprted Mosan artists in different parts of the same article (accessed January 4th, 2010). Few non-Polish sources support local manufacture, despite the Polish emphasis in the [[iconography]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that the artists and craftsmen were imported from further West for the commission, perhaps easier than transporting the single piece of the left door, either in wax or bronze form, across much of Europe. At this time the Polish church had strong links with the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]] and the home area of [[Mosan art]], which led Western European metalwork at this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=876239 |title=Polish Art Treasures at the Royal Academy |first=Andrew |last=Ciechanowiecki |year=1970 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=112 |number=803 |pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has not been settled by the discovery during restoration work in 1956 of partly effaced inscriptions reading "me fecit me...us", "petrus" and "bovo luitinius/latinus", probably giving the name of the craftsman in charge of the casting. These mean "made by" ... "Peter" ..." of ? [place]", with the "luitinius" location probably referring either one the four [[Lutin]]s in modern Poland (not all possible candidates at this date), or [[Lille]] in northern France not far from the Mosan region, or [[Montano Lucino|Lucino]] near [[Como]] in northern Italy. If the reading is "latinus", or "Peter the Latin made me", the meaning is even less clear, but this is regarded as the less likely reading. Neither name is known in any other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;lr=&amp;q=me+fecit+petrus+bovo+Latinus&amp;btnG=Search+Books first link], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ostZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;dq=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;lr=&amp;ei=kVw_S9O5A5e6yQT16OGLCw&amp;cd=4][https://books.google.com/books?id=P9geAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;dq=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;lr=&amp;ei=kVw_S9O5A5e6yQT16OGLCw&amp;cd=3],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The left door (facing the reliefs from outside the cathedral) is 328&amp;nbsp;cm high and 84&amp;nbsp;cm wide, the right 323&amp;nbsp;cm high and 83&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Both are between 1.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm thick. They were cast in bronze using the [[lost wax casting]] technique in a mixture of copper, [[tin]] with a small amount of lead, with some fine detail being added after casting by engraving tools.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbitt, 214&lt;/ref&gt; The left leaf was cast in one piece, but the right was made in 24 cast sections which were then soldered together. Both the lion-headed knockers, which do not align correctly, were also cast separately and soldered. The doors of [[Hildesheim Cathedral]], of about 1015, had pioneered the casting of a large door mostly covered with reliefs in a single piece, which was considerably more difficult than the usual technique of earlier Italian bronze doors, which used bronze relief casts fixed to a wooden core.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 103, Cambell, 318&lt;/ref&gt; Plain doors with no figurative decoration had already been cast whole in Germany - for example for [[Charlemagne]]'s early 9th century [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] at [[Aachen]], following Roman techniques preserved by the [[Byzantine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 318&lt;/ref&gt; The Gniezo left door follows the Hildesheim method. The relief is also typically much higher on the left door, as much as 75% on some figures, where few on the right door reach 25%.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Archaeological Journal|author=Royal Archaeological Institute (London)|date=1852|issue=v. 9|publisher=Royal Archaeological Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-U9AAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Around the central panels runs a decorative frieze of Mosan-style "[[rinceaux]]", or scrolling foliage, with small figures of astrological personifications and other subjects at intervals.

Adalbert had been martyred trying to convert the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], who are shown in some scenes, giving a rare near-contemporary record of their appearance; the Prussians remained largely pagan at the time the doors were made. To illustrate the life of a single saint on such a monumental scale was most unusual at this period, and the doors are the only Romanesque ones in Europe with such a programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Volume 1 of World Art: Themes of Unity in Diversity : Acts of the XXVIth International Congress of the History of Art'', ed. Irving Lavin, p. 53, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-271-00607-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-271-00607-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?ei=Wp4_S42_KZS-ywSQy9HgAw&amp;cd=5&amp;id=eLLpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Gniezno+only+Romanesque+doors+saint&amp;q=Gniezno+doors+saint Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The designs perhaps followed a now lost cycle in an [[illuminated manuscript]] of the life of the saint, though even in this sort of works such an extended pictorial treatment of a saint's life was unusual. [[Adalbert of Prague#Canonization and memory|Two lives of Adalbert]] have survived, written around 1000, soon after his death, but no illuminated copies that throw light on the visual sources for the doors, though their texts help explain the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbitt, 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the origin of the designs, the compositions show the borrowings from more common subject compositions to which early medieval artists usually resorted when confronted with a novel subject; devising new compositions was not part of their training. Some scenes adapt subjects from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' and other models. The left door shows his early life and life in Christian territory; the right one his missionary activities, apparently ignoring those outside modern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Kłoczowski, Jerzy, ''A history of Polish Christianity'', 2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-36429-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-36429-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ecdye8hk_tgC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Gniezno+Doors&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=JVc_S-HtCJfkyQSnn7xe&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=Gniezno%20Doors&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Their iconography "clearly shows they were made as a political statement".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online (Grove), "Door", accessed January 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparable bronze doors in Poland were those made in Magdeburg in about 1150 for [[Plock Cathedral]], using a much less advanced style and technique; however these were carried off during the Middle Ages by a Russian army, and installed in [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]], where they remain. Plock now has 20th century replicas in place.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 318. [[:File:515-1543 IMG.jpg|Image of originals]] and [[:File:Katedra-Płock11.JPG|Image of replicas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In English, this prayer leader is often referred to as [[cantor]], a term also used [[Cantor (Christianity)|in Christianity]].

== ''Sh'liaḥ tzibbur'' and the evolution of the hazzan ==
The person leading the congregation in public [[prayer]]s is called the ''[[Shaliah|sh'liaḥ]] tzibbur'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "[[wikt:emissary|emissary]] of the congregation"). [[halakha|Jewish law]] restricts this role to adult Jews.&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml 
|title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, any lay person can be a ''sh'liaḥ tzibbur''; most synagogue-attending Jews will serve in this role every now and again. Someone with good Hebrew pronunciation is preferred. In practice, those with the best voice and the most knowledge of the prayers serve most often. As public worship was developed in the [[Geonim|Geonic]] period and as the knowledge of the Hebrew language declined, singing gradually superseded the [[didactic]] and [[hortatory]] element in the worship in the synagogue. Thus, while the idea of a cantor as a paid professional does not exist in classical rabbinic sources, the office of the ''hazzan'' increased in importance with the centuries, evolving a specialized skill set and becoming a career in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Qualifications==
Even in the earliest times the chief qualifications demanded of the ''hazzan'', in addition to knowledge of Biblical and liturgical literature as well as the prayer motifs (known as ''steiger''), were a pleasant voice and an artistic delivery; for the sake of these, many faults were willingly overlooked. The ''hazzan'' was required to possess a pleasing appearance, to be married, and to have a flowing beard. Sometimes, according to [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna|Isaac of Vienna]] (13th century), a young ''hazzan'' having only a slight growth of beard was tolerated. [[Maimonides]] decided that the ''hazzan'' who recited the prayers on an ordinary [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and on weekdays need not possess an appearance pleasing to everybody; he might even have a reputation not wholly spotless, provided he was living a life morally free from reproach at the time of his appointment.

But all these moderations of the rule disappeared on holidays; then an especially worthy ''hazzan'' was demanded, one whose life was absolutely irreproachable, who was generally popular, and who was endowed with an expressive delivery. Even a person who had ever litigated in a non-Jewish court, instead of a Jewish court, could not act as ''hazzan'' on those days, unless he had previously done penance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulkhan Arukh]], Orah Hayyim, 581&lt;/ref&gt; However many authorities were lenient in this regard, and as long as a cantor was "merutzeh l'kehal," desired by the congregation, he was permitted to lead the prayers even on the holiest of days.

Today, a ''hazzan'', particularly in more formal (usually not Orthodox) synagogues, is likely to have academic credentials—most often a degree in music or in sacred music, sometimes a degree in music education or in Jewish religious education or a related discipline. The doctor of music degree is sometimes awarded to honour a ''hazzan''.

==Professional status==
The role of ''hazzanim'' as a respected full-time profession has become a reality in recent centuries. In the last two centuries Jews in a number of European communities, notably Germany and Britain, came to view professionally trained ''hazzanim'' as clergy and the ''hazzan'' as the deputy rabbi. After the enlightenment, when European nations gave full citizenship and civil rights to Jews, professionally trained ''hazzanim'' were accepted by the secular governments as clergy in the same way as rabbis.

In a paradoxical turn of events, the United States government recognized cantors as the first Jewish clergy, even before [[rabbi]]s were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who would not have the expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.

In the United States, many hazzanim supplement their ministry by also earning certification as and working as [[mohel]]s, for [[bris]] ceremonies.

In the United States there are three main organizations for professionally trained ''hazzanim'', one from each of the major Jewish denominations:

*[[American Conference of Cantors]]—[[Reform Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rj.org/acc/ American Conference of Cantors]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cantors Assembly]]—[[Conservative Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantors.org/ Cantors Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cantorial Council of America—[[Orthodox Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yu.edu/belz/ Belz School of Jewish Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Many members of the [[Cantors Assembly]] are trained at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America#Cantorial School|H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. Many members of the [[American Conference of Cantors]] are trained at the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music at [[Hebrew Union College]]—Jewish Institute of Religion, School of Sacred Music (New York) Reform. Both of these programs offer a five-year training program. Members of the Cantorial Council can train at the [[Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music]] at [[Yeshiva University]] in New York City.

ALEPH, the movement for Jewish Renewal, includes a cantorial training program as part of its ordination program.

Full cantorial training is also offered by the Cantorial School of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)]] in Los Angeles, the Cantorial Program at the similarly named [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]] in New York, and the School of Jewish Music at [[Hebrew College]]. These institutions are unaffiliated with any particular Jewish denomination.

The curricula for students in these programs generally include, but are not limited to:

{{Div col}} 
* Hebrew: modern, Biblical (Torah), and liturgical (''[[siddur]]'')
* ''[[Nusach]]'' (liturgical tradition)
* Laws and traditions pertaining to Jewish prayer service
* History and content of the ''siddur''
* Music theory, sight-reading
* Playing an instrument, usually a piano or guitar
* Singing technique
* [[Cantillation]]—tropes for the liturgical chanting of biblical books
* Choral conducting
* Jewish history
* [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible)
* Jewish music history
* Pastoral care and counseling
* Theology

===Non-Orthodox titles===
Until 2012, neither the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] nor [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] streams used the term "ordained" for trained cantors; saying "invested" precluded confusion with those they titled rabbi.&lt;ref name=MyCant&gt;{{cite web 
|title=What Is A Cantor (Hazzan or Chazan)?
|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-cantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conservative has stayed with that distinction.

==Female cantors in non-Orthodox Judaism==
Traditionally a ''hazzan'' was always a man.

Today most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism no longer maintain gender distinctions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=examining the concept of gender role ideology

==Golden age==
The period between the two world wars is often referred to as the "golden age" of ''hazzanut'' (cantorial performance). The greats include [[Zavel Kwartin]] (1874–1953), [[Moritz Henle]] (1850–1925), [[Yossele Rosenblatt|Joseph "Yossele" Rosenblatt]] (1882–1933), [[Gershon Sirota]] (1874–1943), and [[Leib Glantz]].

In the post–World War II period, prominent cantors were [[Moshe Koussevitzky]], [[David Werdyger]], [[Frank Birnbaum]], [[Richard Tucker]] and [[Abraham Lopes Cardozo]] (1914–2006). Operatic tenor [[Jan Peerce]], whose cantorial recordings were highly regarded, was never a cantor by profession but often served as one during the [[High Holidays|high holidays]].

Popular contemporary cantors include [[Shmuel Barzilai]], [[Naftali Hershtik]], [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]], Chazzan Avraham Aharon Weingarten, Ari Klein, [[Yaakov Lemmer]], [[Joseph Malovany]], [[Benzion Miller]], Jacob (Jack) Mendelson, Aaron Bensoussan, Aaron Aderet, Alberto Mizrahi, Yaakov Yoseph Stark, Jochen (Yaacov) Fahlenkamp, and Eli Weinberg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.

'''Isaak Izrailevich Brodsky''' ({{lang-ru|Исаак Израилевич Бродский}}; {{lang-uk|Іса́к Ізраїльович Бро́дський}}, {{OldStyleDateDY|6 January|1884|25 December 1883}}&amp;nbsp;– 14 August 1939) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-Jewish painter whose work provided a blueprint for the art movement of [[socialist realism]]. He is known for his iconic portrayals of [[Lenin]] and idealized, carefully crafted paintings dedicated to the events of the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

==Life and career==
Brodsky was born in the village of [[Berdyansk Raion|Sofiyivka]] near [[Berdyansk]] in what is now [[Ukraine]] to Yisrael, a Jewish merchant. He studied at [[Grekov Odessa Art school|Odessa Art Academy]] and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in Saint Petersburg. In 1916 he joined the Jewish Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. When Brodsky asked [[Lenin]] to autograph his painting ''Lenin'', he said: "I am signing to what I don't agree with for the first time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoletie.ru/cgi-bin/email.cgi?data=040914170030&amp;rubrica=101 Stoletie.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodsky was on good terms with many leading Russian painters, including his mentor, [[Ilya Repin]]. He was an avid art collector who donated numerous first-class paintings to museums in his native Ukraine and elsewhere. His superb art collection included important works by Repin, [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Isaak Levitan]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]]. After his death Brodsky's apartment on Arts Square in St. Petersburg was declared a national museum. His art collection is still on exhibit there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rah.ru/content/ru/main_menu_ru/section-museum_activity/section-museum_departments/museum-2005-02-02-13-44-10.html Webpage of the Isaak Brodsky Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011617/http://www.rah.ru/content/ru/main_menu_ru/section-museum_activity/section-museum_departments/museum-2005-02-02-13-44-10.html |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodsky was an Honoured Artist of the [[Russian SFSR]] and a member of the Union of Russian Artists. He was the first painter to be awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjcc.ru/Galereia_MEOC/Brodskii_Isaak/index.html MJCC.ru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504073810/http://mjcc.ru/Galereia_MEOC/Brodskii_Isaak/index.html |date=2007-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he was appointed Director of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|All-Russian Academy of Arts]]. From 1934 to 1939 he was also a head of personal Art workshop in institute, where his pupils included the well-known Soviet painters [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Alexander Laktionov]], [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Piotr Belousov]], [[Piotr Vasiliev]], [[Mikhail Kozell]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|''The Leningrad School of painting. Historical outline. (Russian).'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[Leningrad]] in 1939. His memoirs were published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/brodskii-ii-1883|title=Ленинградский художник Бродский Исаак Израилевич|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism.

'''James Hunter''' (1755–1792) served as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Artillery]] in British India, serving under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]]. Hunter worked as a military artist, and his sketches portray aspects of military and everyday life. Hunter took part in [[Tippu Sultan]] campaigns and other military campaigns in South India. His paintings provide a picture of late 18th century life in South India.

Hunter has sketched different landscapes of South India, including [[Bangalore]], [[Mysore]], Hosur, [[Kancheepuram]], [[Madras]], [[Arcot]], [[Sriperumbudur|Sriperumbadur]], etc. These paintings were published as the third section of ''A Brief history of ancient and modern India embellished with coloured engravings'' published by Edward Orme (London) between 1802-05, as ''Picturesque Views in the Kingdom of Mysore'' published in 1804.&lt;ref name=Ebinesan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebinesan|first1=J|title=James Hunter's Bangalore|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/18249957@N00/sets/72157594460104089/|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BangaloreFirst"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paintings of Tipu’s death &amp; Hindu temple for auction at UK|url=http://www.bangalorefirst.in/?p=2613|accessdate=24 June 2016|agency=Bangalore First|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BL-Ouscottah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb of a 'Killadar' (governor of a fort) Ouscottah (Mysore)|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000141u00000000.html|website=British Library|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Hunter, with the Royal Artillery in India==
In 1791, a detachment of volunteers was raised from the [[Royal Artillery]] battalions for serving in British India. Two companies were created with a major, adjutant and quarter-master, along with the men. The commanding officer was Major David Scott. Lt. James Hunter, along with Captain T Ross and Lieutenants R Clarke, C Gold and W Nicolay were the sub-ordinate officers. Leaving [[Woolwich]] in early 1791, they arrived at [[Madras]] in October 1791. 

These two companies served under Lord Cornwallis in the Tippu Sultan campaigns, leading to the defeat and siege of Tippu's army at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792. Major Scott, was killed on 9 February 1792, during the campaign. After a peace treaty was signed with Tippu Sultan, Lt. James Hunter, with the assistance of Lt C Gold made sketches of life in India and objects and buildings who attracted their attention. These sketches was published by C Gold with the title ''Oriental Drawings'' and attracted much attention in England as they were considered as valuable addition to British understanding of Indian culture. Lt. Hunter died in May 18 1791 (p.78).&lt;ref name="JABrowne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=James Alexander|title=England's Artillerymen: An Historical Narrative of the Services of the Royal Artillery, from the Formation of the Regiment to the Amalgamation of the Royal and Indian Artilleries in 1862|date=1865|publisher=Hall, Smart and Allen|location=London|pages=330|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WNX6_MkijlEC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=lt.+james+hunter+royal+artillery+1792&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cCdG2l87gm&amp;sig=oolMlNpg_7CU8jd7yrWhrzNZI70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0mdyx2r_NAhXsy4MKHXH3B8wQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=lt.%20james%20hunter%20royal%20artillery%201792&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Hunter Memorial==
James Hunter is buried at the Old Cemetery at [[Vellore]], near Commissary Bazar, [[North Arcot]] District. The memorial monument raised by his brother Arthur Hunter, records his birth day as 15 November 1755 and death day as 19 May 1792. As recorded in 1946, a giant banyan tree had fallen on the memorial (pg.4).&lt;ref name="Cotton-2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=Julian James|editor1-last=Baliga|editor1-first=B S|title=List Of Inscriptions On Tombs Or Monuments Madras: Possessing Historical or Archaeological Interest - Volume II|date=1946|publisher=Government Press|location=Madras, British India|url=https://archive.org/details/ListOfInscriptionsOnTombsOrMonumentsMadrasVol2Cotton|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of Bangalore==
[[Bangalore]] was first recorded in paintings in the 17th Century by European artists, who traveled the South India extensively. One such artist was James Hunter, who sketched extensively on the views of [[Mysore]] and the wars with [[Tippu Sultan]]. After his death in 1792, Joseph C Stadler, J B Harraden and H Merke took up the work of 'aquatint etching' of the paintings on copper plates. Forty of Hunter's paintings were published in London in 1804, by Edward Orme, under the title ''Picturesque scenery in the Kingdom of Mysore''. In comparison to the work of Robert Home, Lt. R H Colebroke Capt. Allan, Hunter’s work are associated often with [[Tipu Sultan]] and his father [[Hyder Ali]] and depicts the military and civil life of Bangalore in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Dukan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Views of Bangalore - 1791 AD by James Hunter|url=http://dukan.co.in/sixviews.aspx?mid=4&amp;msid=19|website=Dukan|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the archetype of the "[[sexy librarian]]" has also begun to gain some traction, introduced in an effort to subvert the popular matriarchal image and make them more appealing to the average consumer. Both archetypes boil down to a similar idea, however – an authoritative, implacable guardian of the books who, through either power or sex appeal, keep the library patrons in fear and thus maintain themselves as exclusive guardians of the otherwise obscure organization system in the library.&lt;ref name=LeadPipe/&gt;

==Popular literature==
Children's literature offers a generally positive portrayal of librarians as knowledgeable, helpful, amazing and friendly, becoming more positive over the course of the 20th century.  Adult literature, however, portrays the profession more negatively.  Between these, portrayals of librarians in young adult fiction are neutral to negative.  Here librarians are predominantly female, middle-aged, usually unattractive in some way, and mostly unmarried.  Personality is mixed between positive traits such as intelligence, likeability, and kind-heartedness; and negative traits such as strictness, timidity, excess fastidiousness, and eccentricity.  While some provide assistance to the main characters, several are the villains of the story.  Duties generally include reference, but may only show clerical tasks; however the amount of technology used by librarian characters has increased over time.&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;

A disproportionate number of the librarians represented in novels are in the [[detective fiction]] genre, frequently as an amateur detective and protagonist.  Although the stereotype of the librarian as "passive bore" does not seem reconcilable with the intensity of a mystery, the stereotypical librarian does share many traits with the successful detective.  Their mindset is focused, calm, unbiased in considering viewpoints, and focused on the world around them.  By personality they are industrious perfectionists—and eccentric.  The drab and innocuous look of the stereotypical librarian is perfect for avoiding suspicion, while their research skills and ability to ask the right questions allow them to procure and evaluate the information necessary to solve the case.  The knowledge they have gained from wide reading successfully competes with a private investigator's personal experience.  For example, [[Jacqueline Kirby]] is drawn into the mystery in [[Elizabeth Peters]]' novel ''The Seventh Sinner'' (1972) due to her awareness of her surroundings.  Wearing the stereotypical bun, glasses, and practical clothes, together with an eccentrically large purse, she is self-possessed and resourceful, knowledgeable in a variety of fields and skilled at research.&lt;ref name="Reiman"&gt;{{cite journal

By the 1950s, movies had established the stereotype of librarians as "spinsters" and "eggheads".&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;  Thus, female movie librarians are usually unmarried, prim, and introverted.  They are usually young and may be attractive, but dress drably and are sexually repressed.  The "fate-worse-than-death view of librarians"&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; is particularly evident in movies such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[The Music Man]]''.

Male movie librarians – mild, intelligent, and timid – have fewer and less important roles.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite journal

Seidl's documentary discusses such stereotypes as:
* A wretched alternate fate is revealed for Mary Hatch Bailey (played by [[Donna Reed]]) in the movie ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946): "She's an old maid. She never married...She's just about to close up the library!"
* The staggeringly rude and unhelpful librarian (John Rothman) in ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), who barks at Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep) "Do you want me to draw you a map?!"

in contrast with such more well-rounded characters as:
* Librarian Bunny Watson (played by [[Katharine Hepburn]]) who teaches Richard Sumner (played by [[Spencer Tracy]]) a few things about modern research methods in the movie ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957).
* The no-nonsense "Marian the Librarian" ([[Shirley Jones]]) in the movie ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]''.

=== ''The Pagemaster'' (1994 film) ===
In 1994's live-action animated film ''[[The Pagemaster]]'', frightened and pessimistic Richard Tyler ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) is sent on an errand by his parents but ends up caught in a thunderstorm. He takes shelter in a library, where he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey ([[Christopher Lloyd]]), who encourages Richard to get a library card, despite Richard's protests that he doesn't want a book while he waits out the storm. Mr. Dewey tells Richard that a library card is a "passport to the wonderful and quite unpredictable world of books."

While Richard looks for a phone, he accidentally falls. When he awakens, the library art around him is melting and overtakes him - turning everything into animated illustrations. Richard befriends three books and has to overcome obstacles from classic literature to get back to his real life. At the end of the film, Mr. Dewey "bends the rules" and allows Richard to check out all three books (even though the library has a borrow policy of only two books). Mr. Dewey also smiles to Richard as he leaves, hinting that Mr. Dewey is actually the Pagemaster and none of the adventure was a dream. Mr. Dewey introduced Richard to the adventures possible in libraries and books as he "knows just how magical of a place a library can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/65173-11-of-the-coolest-librarians-from-pop-culture-because-not-every-librarian-is-like-the-one|title=11 Of The Coolest Librarians From Pop Culture, Because Not Every Librarian Is Like the One From Your High School|last=Trombetta|first=Sadie L.|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other examples ===
Librarians are usually ordinary people caught up in circumstances, rather than being heroes; likewise they are rarely villainous although they may have flaws, such as racism in ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]''.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

Other movie appearances of librarians noted in the literature include:
* Mary (played by [[Parker Posey]]) as the ultimate ''[[Party Girl (1995 film)|Party Girl]]'' (1995) who discovers, "I want to be a librarian!" in a notable exception to the prim librarian stereotype.&lt;ref name="Peresie"/&gt;
* Alicia Hull (Bette Davis), a small town librarian, who befriends young Freddie Slater (Kevin Coughlin) but is herself ostracised for refusing to remove a book on Communism from the public library during the height of the Red Scare in ''[[Storm Center]]'' (1956). This movie was inspired by the real-life dismissal of [[Ruth W. Brown|Ruth Brown]], a librarian in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;

In ''[[Only Two Can Play]]'' [[Peter Sellers]] plays the role of a poorly paid and professionally frustrated [[Wales|Welsh]] librarian and occasional drama critic, whose affections fluctuate between glamorous Liz and his long-suffering wife Jean.

The 1999 movie''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' has a main character, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) who is a librarian. The character is awesomely clumsy and later moves away from her profession in the sequels. But a memorable quote from her, upon introduction to the other main character shows a more positive depiction of librarians:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Evelyn''': "Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I am."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Rick:''' "And what is that?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Evelyn:''' "I... am a librarian."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s 2013  film [[Monsters University]], Alison Nastasi of Flavorwire says the university librarian "isn’t fond of noise and doesn’t think twice about tossing rowdy students out the window into a pond below".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/424214/our-favorite-pop-culture-librarians/7|title=Our Favorite Pop Culture Librarians|last=Natasi|first=Alison|date=2013-11-09|work=|newspaper=Flavorwire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

The television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1997-2003) featured the character of [[Rupert Giles]] as school librarian at Sunnydale High and mentor for the main character of Buffy. At the start of the series Giles is often portrayed stereotypically, for example he wears old-fashioned clothes and spectacles, is intelligent and well-read though has a dislike for computers, and is overly concerned with following regulations. As the series progresses the character is given the opportunity to develop beyond these stereotypes as we learn that Giles was a rebellious and angry teenager who was partly responsible for the death of a friend after dabbling in dark magic. He is also depicted at being competent with weaponry and hand-to-hand combat and at playing the guitar and singing. Though Giles never has a long-lasting on-screen relationship and has never been married, he does have brief romances on screen and is acknowledged as an attractive man by other characters in the show; therefore at least partially refuting the usual stereotype.

From 2004-2008, the [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]] fantasty-adventure television film franchise, [[The Librarian (franchise)|''The Librarian'']], aired on TNT. The three films focus on a librarian (portrayed by [[Noah Wyle]]) who protects secret artifacts in the Metropolitan Public Library in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/04/10/tnt-greenlights-the-librarians-franchise-as-a-series-with-rebecca-romijn|title=TNT greenlights 'The Librarians' franchise as a series|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film franchise led to the television series [[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|''The Librarians'']]  which began airing in 2014 on TNT. It follows a new team of librarians who solve mysteries, recover powerful artifacts, and fight against supernatural threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/04/10/the-librarians-tv-series-tnt-rebecca-romijn-noah-wyle/|title=TNT Orders Librarians Series Starring Rebecca Romijn, Leverage Fave; Noah Wyle to Recur|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|last2=|first2=|date=2014-04-10|website=TVLine|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 "[[Ron and Tammy]]" episode of the NBC comedy series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', Leslie Knope's dreams of a local park are almost squashed by Tammy, the new library director at the Pawnee Public Library and Ron Swanson's ex-wife. Tammy places a claim for the lot that Leslie intended to use for her park. Tammy then tries to sexually manipulate Ron into giving her the lot for the library. Leslie calls librarians "diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats" as well as "punk-ass book jockeys." In "[[Ron &amp; Tammy: Part Two|Ron and Tammy: II]]", Leslie says Tammy is "just a manipulative, psychotic, library book-peddling, sex-crazed, she-demon." Tammy also has books on "Approved" and "Rejected" shelves, which insinuate that the library operates in a biased manner. The depictions of the library on ''Parks and Recreation'' "illuminate the nature of library anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewell|first=Eamon|title="Punk-Ass Book Jockeys": Library Anxiety in the Television Programs Community and Parks and Recreation|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2587&amp;context=libphilprac|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season two episode six of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' entitled "Caged", actor [[Michael A. Goorjian]] plays Aaron Pratt, an autistic librarian who witnesses the death of a colleague. Aaron states that he has "a masters in library science and an English Degree from UNLV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=13218|title=02x07 - Caged - CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Transcripts - Forever Dreaming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0534662/|title=Caged|date=8 November 2001|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In currently running SyFy show ''The Magicians'' (based on the series by Lev Grossman), the Library of the Neitherlands is an archive that contains all of the knowledge in the universe. Librarians formed the Order of the Librarians, a group that protects that knowledge. The Library is staffed by Zelda Schiff, a prim, glasses-and-cardigan wearing librarian whose biggest concern is possible defacement of library books.

That coupled with her recognizable frames made her an example of what the sexy librarian looks like.

'''Maskit''' ({{he| משכית}}) is an [[State of Israel|Israeli]] fashion house founded in 1954 by [[Ruth Dayan]], wife of [[Moshe Dayan]]. It was the country's first [[fashion house]]. Maskit produces textiles, clothing, objets d’art and jewelry.
==Etymology==
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A Striking Outfit.jpg|thumb|150px|Maskit dress, 1956]]
The [[Hebrew]] word "maskit," meaning an ornament, or something small and beautiful, appears in   the [[Bible]] 14 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephdeacetis/2017/05/16/how-an-israeli-luxury-fashion-brand-transitions-to-modified-heritage/#11a310087875 How an Israeli luxury fashion brand transitions to modified heritage, [[Forbes]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ruth Dayan at maskit.jpg|thumb|Maskit founder [[Ruth Dayan]] and [[Miss Israel]] 1956, Sara Tal, with Maskit tunic]]
In the early years of the state, when the government was seeking work opportunities for [[aliyah|new immigrants]] to Israel, Ruth Dayan realized that many of them were skilled in decorative arts such as embroidery, rugs, and arts and crafts.  The concept of Maskit, which Dayan founded in 1954, was to take  modern European patterns and combine them with ethnic embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/maskit-the-revamping-of-israels-first-ever-fashion-house/ Maskit: The revamping of Israel's first ever fashion house]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Dayan met fashion designer Finy Leitersdorf, who designed clothes and accessories for Maskit over a period of 15 years. The two collaborated on a joint exhibit of Maskit designs at the Dizengoff Museum (today the [[Tel Aviv Museum]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.559589 Breathing new life into legendary Israeli fashion brand Maskit,] [[Haaretz]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview in 1966, Leitersdorf spoke about the "Israeliness" of Maskit clothing. It was not just the [[Yemen]]ite embroidery, she said, but the "range of colors - the desert brown, the impure black inspired by Bedouin tents, and the eternally changing blue of the Mediterranean." She also cited the loose design, which made life more comfortable in the country's hot climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/a-leitersdorf-showcase-1.379537 A Leitersdorf showcase, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskit enjoyed worldwide success in the 1960s, with clients that included [[Audrey Hepburn]]. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Maskit employed 2,000 people, with ten stores in Israel and one in New York. Maskit garments were sold by Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Fashion/McQueen-to-Maskit-The-mind-behind-the-brand-348614 McQueen to Maskit: The mind behind the brand]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The company closed in 1994 but it was reopened in 2013 by Nir and Sharon Tal, who had worked for   Deloitte and Alexander McQueen. One of the investors was Israeli businessman [[Stef Wertheimer]], founder of the industrial tool manufacturer [[Iscar]] purchased by [[Warren Buffett]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/fashion/despite-tel-aviv-bombings-the-fashion-show-goes-on.html?_r=0 Fashion despite Tel Aviv bombings: The fashion show goes on, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;Sharon Tal, now the company's chief designer, re-established the brand in cooperation with Dayan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''music library''' contains music-related materials for [[patron use]].  Collections may also include non-print materials, such as digitized music scores or [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recording]]s.  Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions.  Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, [[Sheet music|printed music]], music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature.

==Types==
Traditionally, there are four types of '''music libraries''':

#Those developed to support departments of music in university or college settings;
#Those developed to support conservatories and schools of music;
#Those housed within public libraries;
#Those developed as independent libraries or archives supporting music organizations.

==Musical instrument library==
A musical instrument library lends or shares [[musical instruments]]. Examples can be found in [[Canada]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joesmill.wordpress.com/ |title=Joe's M.I.L.L. |author= |location=Kingston, Ontario, Canada |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning/musical-library-1.3524976 |title=Toronto Public Library creates city's 1st musical instrument lending program |work=CBC |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perth, Australia]];&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.instrumentlenders.com Instrument Lenders Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611084125/http://instrumentlenders.com/ |date=2013-06-11 }} ... an instrument lending library, situated in Perth County, which supplies instruments mainly to youth at no cost for up to 6 months." {{citation |title=Voices of Youth |author=Perth County Social Research and Planning Council |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://themusary.com/ The Musary], a Hamilton-based nonprofit "lending library" of musical instruments." {{citation |title=Sharing the music: in honor of a late Hamilton resident, lending library brings instruments to students at the Beverly School for the Deaf |author=James Sullivan |date= 15 Dec 2011 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The South Shore Folk Music Club of Kingston, Massachusetts, maintains an instrument lending library. {{citation |title=For club, it's been 20 years strumming |author=Judith Montminy |date=27 Sep 1998 |work=Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bark.cwmars.org/eg/opac/record/2715816 |author=Sheffield Bushnell-Sage Library |title=Ukulele |publisher=CW/MARS |location=Massachusetts |accessdate=Oct 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oddmusicuc.wordpress.com/instrumentarium-catalogue/ |title=Oddmusic Instrumentarium |location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, US |accessdate=3 May 2012|date=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libraryasincubatorproject.org/?p=15789 |title=Guitar Lending Collection at Licking County Library |date= December 2014 |work=Library as Incubator Project |location=USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/us/breaking-out-of-the-library-mold-in-boston-and-beyond.html |title=Breaking Out of the Library Mold, in Boston and Beyond |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |newspaper=New York Times |last1=Seelye |first1=Katharine Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://rootnotemusicshop.com/instrumentlibrary/ New Paltz, New York]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/09/08/music-for-the-masses-the-new-paltz-instrument-library/|title=Music for the masses: The New Paltz instrument library|last=Ward|first=Terence P.|website=Hudson Valley One|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.

* [[Production music|Production music libraries]] license their copyrighted music for use in film, television, and radio productions.
* Performance libraries serve performing music groups, particularly large orchestras, by acquiring, preparing, and maintaining music for performance.
* [[Digital music library|Digital music libraries]] and archives preserve recordings and digitized scores or literature in a variety of [[audio file format|electronic formats]].  Many music libraries dedicate part of their duties to digitizing parts of their collection and maintaining digital files.  [[Digital preservation]] requires specific procedures to avoid decay, obsolescence, and loss.  Digital materials may be part of a larger, physical collection, or may compose an entirely electronic collection not physically accessible (usually housed on a network or on the Internet).  Access may be limited as a fee-based service, a private service to specific user groups (such as students at a conservatory), or freely accessible to the public.

'''''Musical Party in a Hall''''' (c. 1663-1665) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the [[Museum der bildenden Künste]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "126. THE MUSIC-PARTY. deG. 34.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the left in a large hall, the left-hand portion of which is represented, sit three persons at a table covered with an Ispahan carpet, upon which are some oranges. One gentleman plays the cello, another the flute, while a lady sings. The flute-player sits on the extreme left behind the table, wearing a slouch hat. 
The cello-player sits to the right of the table, in full view of the spectator ; he has long curls, and wears knee-breeches and a pink doublet with slashed sleeves over a white shirt with broad cuffs. He raises a glass with his left hand and holds his bow with his right. He looks at the lady sitting at his right ; she has her music-book in her lap, and wears a greenish bodice and a yellow silk skirt. Between the two men is a boy, and behind him a couple. From the right comes a little dog. At the back of the hall a flight of stone steps goes up through a door. A second door on the right shows a well-lighted room, in which a young couple stand. Above these doors a copy of [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' is let into the wall.

According to Dr. [[Wilhelm von Bode|W. Bode]], the picture dates from about 1662 to 1665. Its canvas is 32 inches by 27 inches. Described by Ch. Blanc, Le Tresor de la Curiosite, ii. 262. 
Owners of the painting include Pierre de Grand Pre, Paris, February 16, 1809 (bought for 2620 -francs, Paillet), James, London, 1892 (Thieme), and its in the collection of the [[Alfred Thieme|A. Thieme]] at Leipzig, No. 45 in the 1900 catalogue&lt;ref&gt; see the introduction by Dr. W. Bode, p. 32, [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/510/mode/1up entry 126 for ''The Music-Party''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The large hall, the left-hand portion of the painting, is a gallery of the main hall of the (then) Amsterdam City Hall, today the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. The painting at the back is a fantasized version of the ''School of Athens'' by Raphael, but in reality another painting was installed. The gallery is possibly the one in the southeast corner near the registry office for weddings, as there are three couples represented. Possibly the doorway on the right is meant to be the registry office itself.

De Hooch made at least two more paintings with scenes of the interior of the Amsterdam City Hall:

[[File:Praha Manes.jpg|thumb|right|The Manes building.]]

The '''Mánes Association of Fine Artists''' ({{Lang-cs|'''Spolek výtvarných umělců Mánes'''}} or '''''S.V.U.'''''; commonly abbreviated as ''Manes'') was an artists' association and exhibition society founded in 1887 in [[Prague]] and named after painter [[Josef Mánes]].

The Manes was significant for its international exhibitions before and after [[World War I]] that encouraged interaction between Czech artists and the foreign avant-garde. It played an important role in the development of [[Czech Cubism]] and Rondocubism. Between 1928 and 1930, Manes built a complex with a restaurant, club, showroom and offices at the site of the Štítkovský Mill and [[water tower]] on the [[Vltava]]. The architect of the 1928 Manes pavilion was member {{Interlanguage link multi|Otakar Novotný|cs}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/czech-living/arts-leisure/manes-restoration-aims-return-functionalist-gallery%E2%80%99s-former-glory Mánes restoration aims to return functionalist gallery’s former glory] by Ian Willoughby, czechposition.com, 12 January 2012.

The union was liquidated under the Communists and was revived after the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1990. Its headquarters became the Diamond House in Prague, itself a landmark of cubist architecture.

== Formative years (1885–1899) ==

''Svaz výtvarných umělců Mánes'' ("Association of Fine Artists Mánes") was established in 1887 as a group of [[Bohemia]]n artists in the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]]. Its forerunner was '''Škréta, spolek mladých českých výtvarníků v Mnichově''' ("Škréta, a Fellowship of Young Czech Artist in Munich"), an organization of Czech art students in [[Munich]], an art center largely visited by Central and Eastern European art students. The name of this society came from seventeenth century Bohemian painter [[Karel Škréta]]. Formed in 1885 it became one of the largest communities of Czech students abroad. It had its own infrastructure and annual show. It had regular contact with the homeland and published a journal in two parts: ''Paleta'' &amp; ''Špachtle'' ("Palette" and "Spatula"). This journal was circulated within the association only and all members had to contribute to it on weekly bases. Their focus was mainly on the German art scene. The group accepted other [[Slavic people|Slavic]] students as members.

The Škréta Fellowship renamed itself to ''Svaz výtvarných umělců Mánes'' ([[Abbreviation|abb.]] SVU Mánes), after painter J. Mánes, who lived and worked in the first half of the nineteenth century in [[Czech Lands]] and [[German Empire|Germany]], and who attended the [[Munich Art Academy]]. Many founding members of the ''Škréta'' moved to Prague in 1887 – probably due to reforms at the [[Prague Art Academy]] – and finished their studies there. The Škréta Fellowship continued until its members [[Alfons Mucha]] and [[Luděk Marold]] left Munich for [[Paris]].

Between 1885 and 1899 the focus was mainly on ''Palette'' and ''Spatula.'' ''Palette'' was a journal of art and literature and ''Spatula'' was a satirical magazine. These first fourteen years were the most important for the future development of modern Czech art scene. SVU Mánes took under its wings painting, sculpture and architecture. This notion was reflected in their emblem of three shields representing each the three art forms. The goals of SVU Mánes were mainly based on an old idea of patriotism with allegorical paintings from the Czech history, but they soon moved to modern art and its influx in Bohemia. One of the main differences from neighboring groups such as Munich and [[Viennese Secession]] was in their constant fight against [[pan-Germanism]]. One difference from [[Poles|Polish]] group ''Sztuka'' was in SVU Mánes’ openness to the international art scene.

== Infrastructure ==

SVU Mánes averaged some 300 members between 1887 and 1899. It was a large organization for the Prague environment and for a secessionist group. Its first elected president was painter and illustrator [[Mikoláš Aleš]], a (Aleš illustrated Old Czech manuscripts and was proclaimed by the critics as naïve, but SVU Mánes supported him and presented him with a diploma). Aleš, twenty years older than the rest of the members, had strong leadership and organization skills. Along with a sculptor, principal patron and chief organizer of SVU Mánes, [[Stanislav Sucharda]], they formed a strong lead. The editorial board was elected annually. The first most influential editors were painter Karel Vítězslav and painter and draughtsman [[Jan Preisler]]. Probably the most important role in SVU Mánes had {{Interlanguage link multi|František Xaver Šalda|cs}}, a journalist and an art critic.

== Evolution of secession in Prague ==

SVU Mánes rebelled against the old and rigid system of art exhibitions, art politics and pan-Germanism of art in Czech. Multiple events helped the patriotic SVU Mánes to achieve its success before their first exhibition in 1898.

* Jubilejní Výstava [[General Land Centennial Exhibition (1891)|Jubilee Exposition]] in Prague in 1891 included an art exhibition.
* In 1893 student political party Omladina [The Youth] was established looking for autonomy from the Empire.
* In 1893 Czech artists published a petition in general newspapers. They appealed to citizens to support Czech art by commissions and visitations of Czech art exhibitions.
* In 1895 the Manifest of Czech Modernism was published, signed mainly by writers and critics (including F. X. Šalda). It proclaimed neutrality in politics and humanist ideals. They were interested in Czech history, in feminist issues and individualism even in politics. Mánes was their great example.
* A book by [[Tomaš Garigue-Masaryk]] (future first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]) ''Česká otázka'' (Czech Question) whose focus was the nation’s evolution based on humanist principles, solution of social problems and [[anti-Semitism]]. Masaryk compared Czech history with the world’s historical evolution.
* The first Czech art exhibition in Topič salon produced a promotional poster by Viktor Oliva that was the first Bohemian poster exhibited internationally.
* In 1897, Rudolfínum (an equivalent to Parisian Salon) exhibited 950 works of art and received mocking reviews of a tasteless and overcrowded installation.
* In 1898 Czech language decrees (attempt to promote Czech as an equal language to German) reached their height with victory for Czechs. The Austrian government in Prague fell. The national celebration was visible in an annual exhibition of the German Art Union trying to exhibit a painting by [[Franz von Lenbach Theodor Mommsen]]. Mommsen was a German historian who the Czech public viewed as a great chauvinist. The reaction against this painting by the Czech audience caused the painting’s removal to protect it. This was followed by an appeal in newspapers for artists to leave the German Art Union and to boycott this show.
* In 1898, SVU Mánes exhibited its first group show.

== Important Exhibitions ==

=== 1897-98 ===

In 1897, SVU Mánes opened its first preliminary exhibition of competing posters. These were designed for its first exhibition the following year.

SVU Mánes' first exhibition was 5 February to 5 March in 1898 in Topič salon (a commercial gallery in the center) in Prague. With this exhibition, SVU Mánes proclaimed its secession. Thirty participants among the eighty members with landscapes dominating the show. The installation was similar to that in Rudolfínum, but many fewer works were selected.

On 3 November another exhibition was held in the same location, exhibiting fifty works from artists [[Joža Uprka]], František Bílek, [[Zdenka Braunerová]], [[Antonín Hudeček]] and [[Antonín Slavíček]]. With this exhibition, the members refused Rudolfínum as an exhibiting society, and stepped toward their own exhibiting building. This exhibition went up during the same time of preparation of the first exhibition of the Viennese Secession with which they had a competitive relationship. SVU Mánes show attracted members of Viennese society, who offered participation to Czech painters to exhibit in Vienna. František Bílek agreed, while Stanislav Sucharda refused absent an autonomous Czech show in Vienna.

=== 1899-1900 ===

In 1899, SVU Mánes began organizing traveling exhibitions in other towns of Bohemia and Moravia to increase public awareness.

In 1900 SVU Mánes exhibited in Viennese Künstlerhaus.

Also in 1900, SVU Mánes opened its third exhibition, showing sixty works in the Topič salon. KU Ministerium supported this show. It toured Brno and Vienna, getting more credit on its home soil as a competitor to Rudolfínum, but it brought new audiences and recognition in the international press. Among the exhibiting artists was [[Jan Preisler]] with his ''The Wind and Breeze'', František Bílek, who caused surprise and [[František Kupka]]. After this exhibition, Antonín Slavíček and Maxmilián Švabinský (''The Poor Country'') were invited to Miethke gallery in Vienna and Švabinský became the most exportable Bohemian artist. For the first time, SVU Mánes’ exhibition had a designer in architect Jan Kotěra who focused on simplicity and purity with respect to painting, sculpture and prints. This differed from the over-crowdedness of Rudolfínum and the over-ornamentation of the Viennese Secession. Sculptures were not for decoration but they were installed as autonomous art works.

=== 1902 ===

In 1902, SVU Mánes exhibited in Hagenbund, which became its frequent host.

After a visit to [[Paris Exposition of 1900]], Alfons Mucha and [[Josef Mařatka]] invited sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] to exhibit his works in Prague. This event took place in Manes’ new exhibiting building, the Mánes Pavilion in 1902, designed by [[Jan Kotěra]]. Kotěra took on an idea of Paradise with each sculpture displayed in its own space, not competing with the others, with floors covered with gravel and shrubs expanding the garden theme. This show utterly overshadowed Rudolfínum, making SVU Mánes the main exhibiting body in Bohemia. The exhibition also increased public interest in foreign art. Rodin influenced artists such as Sucharda, [[Ladislav Šaloun]] and [[Bohumil Kafka]]. This show had a political background of Czech intellectuals looking toward France, appealing to French republican artistic freedom. Rodin showed eighty sculptures and seventy drawings. His sculptures revealing intimate bodily details, sexuality and psychological expression, was new to Prague. He was taken as a genius by artists and critics, who appealed for Czech artists to follow his path by looking to themselves. This exhibition had a further impact on Austria and Germany. After Prague, Rodin took some of his pieces to Vienna. This show made Prague an international exhibiting city.

Following Rodin’s exhibition, SVU Mánes presented a retrospective of contemporary French painting the Nabis who Czech artists knew since the 1890s from their Parisian visits for their freedom of form and deliberate experiments.

Another exhibit presented works of Mikolaš Aleš, Hudeček and French graphic arts.

The year's last exhibition was a visiting show in Kraków hosted by Sztuka. Among the 132 Czech artists who exhibited there, belonged František Bílek, Sucharda, Kafka, Šaloun, Joža Úprka, Maxmilián Švabinský, Alois Kalvoda, Antonín Slavíček, František Kupka and others.

=== 1903 ===

A similar exhibition opened in 1903 in the Mánes Pavilion, surveying Czech art production, followed by a retrospective of Josef Mánes. He was the only non-contemporary artist exhibited in SVU Mánes.

An exhibition of Worpswede continued SVU Mánes’ interest in international art scene along with another show of Croatian contemporary art of Družstvo umjetnosti [Association of Art].

=== 1904 ===

Returning to the domestic art scene, SVU Mánes hosted a retrospective of Joža Úprka.

SVU Mánes members had their first group show in their new building, followed by a group show of Antonín Slavíček, Bohumil Kafka, Josef Mařatka, Stanislav Sucharda and Ladislav Šaloun.

=== 1905 ===

SVU Mánes presented an exhibition of [[Edvard Munch]].

Following Munch show was another group exhibition and after that an exhibition of T. F. Simon.

In the winter of 1905-06, SVU Mánes hosted Danish artists.

=== 1906-07 ===

1906 brought an exhibition of [[Nicholas Roerich|N. K. Roerich]] along with [[Francisco Goya]] and another member show.

The following year Henri le Sidaner together with Louis Dejean exhibited. After that, French Impressionism occupied the Mánes Pavilion.

Members and architects established Sdružení architektů Mánese [Association of Mánes’ Architects] that, a year later, began publishing its journal ''Styl'' [Style] concentrating on contemporary art and design.

At the turn of 1907 and 1908, English etchings arrived to Prague under the SVU Mánes’ umbrella.

=== 1908-10 ===

Auguste Rodin together with Ludwig v. Hofmann exhibited in 1908, followed by SVU Mánes’ group show.

Émile Bernard; E. A. Bourdelle; SVU Mánes’ group show came in 1909.

In 1910 SVU Mánes’ presented a group show of sketches: Les Independents; Slavíček; Axel Gellen-Kellela; Munch; and Swedish Art.

== Impact of Munch Show ==

When SVU Mánes presented Edvard Munch, the audience was shocked. This artist had an immense impact on the future development of modern art in Bohemia. No other show divided Czech artists as much. The artist community fell into two hostile camps. In 1907, eight art students formed "Osma" [The Eight], finding SVU Mánes too provincial. 

F. X. Šalda was the only critic who agreed with the new group. The main two members of Osma were Bohumil Kubišta and Emil Filla. Kubišta responded with ''Night of Love'' in 1908 and Filla with ''Reader of Dostoevsky'' in 1907. Jan Preisler was the only SVU Mánes member who responded to Munch with his painting ''Woman by a Lake'', however after harsh criticism he abandoned this style. Criticism of Preisler’s work angered Osma even more.

== 1912–1914: Cubist schism ==

In 1912, SVU Mánes split, following the [[Cubism|Cubist]] art scene in Paris: the Montmartre Cubism of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and [[Section d'Or]] Cubism led by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]]. Prague's key followers of Montmartre Cubism in Prague were artists [[Emil Filla]] and [[Otto Gutfreund]], while the nucleus of the opposing camp was created around the Čapek brothers. Bohemian Cubists combined Cubism with [[Expressionism]], some with [[Futurism]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Rayonism]], while others concentrated on national or [[existentialism|existential]] subject matters. The artists influenced by Montmartre Cubism established Skupina výtvarných umelců [Group of Artists].

== ''Volné Směry'' journal ==

''Volné Směry'' (''Free Currents'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=cl&amp;cl=CL1&amp;sp=bmtnaan Volné Směry, available online: November 1896 - 1902 (61 issues), Blue Mountain Project]&lt;/ref&gt; was a journal of SVU Mánes first published in 1896. At first the association oriented its journal mainly toward literature, another driving force behind the Czech secessionist movement. Association members competed in its pages. The journal worked as a ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' [total work of art]. The editors also included information about international and domestic art scene and art criticism.

In 1902, installation designs began to appear. The journal competed mainly with Ver Sacrum of the Viennese Secession in content and form. At this point, its primary goal was promotion of Czech art along with introduction and commentary on the international art scene. Its funding came at first from members. The main editors were Vojtěch Preisler and Arnošt Hofbauer. ''Volné směry'' reached a wide public, with coverage better than its main competitor journal ''Moderní revue'' [Modern Review]. Other competing journals in Czech at the time were: ''L’Art'', ''L'Art et industrie'', ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'', ''Revue des Arts Decoratifs'', ''La Plume'', ''L’ Art et les artistes'', ''The Art Amateur'', ''Art Journal'', ''Art Pictorial &amp; Industrial'', ''The Studio'', ''Formenschatz'', ''[[Dekorative Kunst]]'', ''Die Kunst'', ''Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration'', ''Kunst und Handwerk'', ''Skulpturenschatz'', ''Zeitschrift für Bildende Kunst'' and ''Die Graphischen Kunste''. In 1897, in its second volume, a special issue was dedicated to regionalist painter Úprka.

A year later, Kotěra published an essay to appeal to Czech citizens to think for themselves when looking at art and architecture. He stated that Czech art and architecture should be Czech, with Czech form, using local materials and technologies. Form should reflect modern times and should not mimic foreign art and architecture. Kotěra used a universal and pragmatic tone in his essay, without providing a definition of the Czech form. Open debates in ''Volné směry'' and other journals considered the planned destruction of Prague’s historical center.

In 1899, a special issue was dedicated to symbolist sculptor František Bílek. In the same year, Kotěra became one of the main editors and a professor of University of Architecture and Applied Arts in Prague. He studied directly under [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna. At the turn of the century, a special issue devoted to the Third SVU Mánes exhibition was produced for the first time for Viennese audiences. The Rodin show was accompanied by a special double-issue dedicated to the sculptor in 1901, a year before its opening. By 1903, the journal established a comfortable position financially with approximately 1800 subscribing readers.

== Mánes Pavilion ==

In 1902 Kotěra designed the Mánes Pavilion for the Rodin exhibition. It was supposed to be only a temporary building, erected in four weeks. The pavilion was functional and flexible. Lit from the top, it had movable walls and Karel Špillar adorned it with a patriotic Slavic wooden lintel and allegorical mosaic. Manes used it until 1914. Its location was near the city center, close to a space where Prague officials wanted to build a modern gallery.

'''National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped''' (NTWH) was a [[New York City]]-based repertory theatre company and theatre school, providing training and performing space for writers and performers with disabilities, founded in 1977 by Father Rick Curry, S.J.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} NTWH had programs for acting, singing, voice, writing, and theatre production, and thousands of theatre students and performers with disabilities participated in the company's programs in New York City as well as a campus in [[Belfast, Maine]].

==History==
Father Rick Curry's interest in performing became a major activity during his years in university. He gained experience in theatre and television commercial work.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} His university graduate studies were in theatre arts, which led to a PhD in the field from [[New York University]].

Curry, born without a right hand and forearm, had his first experience with open discrimination against his disability allegedly when he tried to audition for a role in a mouthwash commercial, and the receptionist burst out laughing, assuming he had been sent in as a joke.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} Months later, he founded NTWH in 1977 in [[Lower Manhattan]].

The company's goals included training students in communication skills that would help them in professional theatre, and to "enhance their opportunities in the workplace".{{sfn|Theatre Communications Group|2010|p=510-1}} Theatre schools commonly overlooked or excluded students who have a disability; so NTWH helped address this problem, offering courses in academic subjects and also practical theatre skills. NTWH aimed to "create a theatrical arena in which disabled and able-bodied actors and playwrights collaborate, train, and perform together". Community events were also held to stage dramatic works dealing with "themes of disability".{{sfn|Rogers|Henry|2007|p=222}}

Curry brought a new focus to projects involving disabled veterans. The Writers’ Program for Wounded Warriors provided a forum for veterans to write dramatic monologues about their war experiences.{{sfn|Coronado|2009}}

Curry was a member of the Roman [[Catholic]] [[Jesuit]] order for more than 50 years, first as a Jesuit Brother, and more recently, as a priest and Chaplain at [[Georgetown University]]. Curry maintained that his theatre values reflected his Jesuit training:{{blockquote|''Eloquentia perfecta'', the perfection of eloquence, is the end result of Jesuit education,” Curry said. “The student can stand on his or her own two feet and defend what he or she believes. This is what I wanted to do for the disabled, who have been ignored for so long. People never asked them what they thought or how they felt, so once you have empowered a disabled person artistically, you have in fact empowered a disabled person.”{{sfn|Coronado|2009}}}}

===Maine projects===
NTWH expanded its scope in 1996, launching a campus in Belfast, Maine, as a seasonal adjunct, and purchasing a local school from the city.{{sfn|Curtis|2012}} A variety of projects were run through NTWH's Belfast campus, such as a theatre workshop, a fine arts gallery, a baking school, and a bakery in Belfast, all managed by people with disabilities.{{sfn|Goldstein|2012|p=187-8}} The Maine facility was also residential and fully [[accessibility|accessible]].{{sfn|Theatre Communications Group|2010|p=511}} NTWH's Belfast projects additionally included Summer theatre camps for children, both with and without disabilities.{{sfn|Whitehouse|2003|p=7}}

===Decline===
Beginning in 2004, NTWH began having several financial problems which caused it to go into arrears on mortgage payments both with its New York studio and Belfast campus. This nearly culminated in a [[foreclosure]] auction in 2005,{{sfn|Groening|2005}} though NTWH was able to temporarily satisfy its debts by selling auxiliary buildings in Belfast.  Later years, however, were more difficult for NTWH, and in 2010 the City of Belfast temporarily seized the Maine campus for non-payment of a sewer bill.{{sfn|Curtis|2010}}{{sfn|Curtis|2012}} Belfast City Manager Joe Slocum toured the building in January 2011 and found it abandoned and neglected.{{sfn|City of Belfast|2011}} In January 2017, a local Belfast resident purchased the building with plans to renovate it for multi-functional use.  {{sfn|http://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/05/business/new-owner-plans-co-housing-performance-space-for-old-belfast-high-school/}}

NTWH's New York ensemble gave a final performance on August 25, 2008, in Sag Harbour, New York, before suspending its operations. NTWH's final production was titled ''In Honour of Service'', a performance of monologues written by participants in the NTWH Writer's Program for Wounded Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped – Final Performance|url=http://jlspalla.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/launching-mysite-recent-performance/|publisher=John Spalla|accessdate=July 26, 2012|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the former members of NTWH Cabaret, a project of the larger NTWH, continue performing in New York City as of 2011, and they have reformed in a new performing organization called Encompassing Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘NTWH Cabaret’ Reborn as ‘Encompassing Voices’|url=http://jlspalla.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/ntwh-cabaret-reborn-as-encompassing-voices/|publisher=John Spalla|accessdate=July 26, 2012|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Curry died on December 19, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA after a long, undisclosed illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/people/richard-curry-jesuit-who-served-people-disabilities-and-veterns-has-died]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OPEN LOOK''' is a major annual [[contemporary dance]] festival presented by Dance House [http://www.kannondance.ru/school_e.php "Kannon Dance"] in [[Saint Petersburg|St.Petersburg, Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimesrussia.com/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=18093 The St.Petersburg Times, Issue #1182 (48), Friday, June 30, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is an international event offering training and performance programs that cover a wide range of contemporary dance forms. 
 
Established in 1999 as a means to introduce new audiences to dance and held each summer during the beautiful St.-Petersburg [http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/whitenights.asp White Nights], it gathers hundreds of professional dancers, choreographers and teachers from all over the world for a two-week program of performance and intensive workshops by well known dance masters. '''OPEN LOOK''' presents a concert program featuring performers from abroad and Russia on several stages of St.-Petersburg. 

The main aim of the festival is to share the best of Western culture with Russian public and dance society, to provide atmosphere and space for international artistic collaboration, knowledge, experience exchange, creative work, and education. Born in the West, contemporary dance is quite a new thing to Russia that has been for a long time thriving on classical tradition in arts and especially dance. However, contemporary dance draws more and more attention and public interest here and develops intensively.

'''''Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum''''' (full title: '''''Prima pars Promptuarii iconum insigniorum à seculo hominum, subiectis eorum vitis, per compendium ex probatissimis autoribus desumptis''''') &lt;small&gt;({{Pronunciation|Promptuarii Iconum Insiniorum.ogg}})&lt;/small&gt; is an [[iconography]] book by [[Guillaume Rouillé]]. It was published in [[Lyon]], France, in 1553. The work includes portraits designed as [[medal]]s, and brief biographies of many notable figures. Although Julian Sharman, author of ''The library of Mary Queen of Scots'', judges the work to be "not one of much numismatic interest",&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVA-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22Promptuarii+Iconum+Insigniorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qZCZUdavIoLi8gSb0YDgBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Promptuarii%20Iconum%20Insigniorum%22&amp;f=false 153].&lt;/ref&gt; he notes that, "This work has been pronounced to be one of the marvels of early wood-engraving."&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, p.

Many of the figures portrayed are of English origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, p.

"Promptuarii Iconum insigniorum a Seculo Hominum, with 950 fine woodcut medallion portraits (many English)."&lt;/ref&gt; The images begin with [[Adam and Eve]]. In the preface, the publisher praises the work.&lt;ref&gt;"''Abhandlungen Der Königlich Preussischen Akademie Der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-Historische Classe.''", p.

'''''Saint Jerome Hears the Trumpet of the Last Judgment''''' is a 1779 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]].  

== Description ==
[[Jerome]], one of the four [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], is depicted as a half-clad [[anchorite]] in his cell, with common iconographical attributes, a cross, a skull and bible. He is holding a [[quill]] in his right hand, indicating that he is writing the [[Vulgate]]. He is wearing the red garb of a cardinal, indicative of his role as secretary to [[Pope Damasus I]]. The skull skull alludes to this intellectual and penitential life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|last=Cross|first=The Late F.

== Provenance ==
The painting came to Quebec City between 1901 and 1908,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; owned by Henriette and Geneviève Cramail.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-national-gallery-rebuffs-quebec-museums-offer-to-share-ownership-of/|title=National Gallery brushes off pitch from Quebec museums to share David painting|last=Hannay|first=Chris|date=April 17, 2018|work=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After David's death in 1825, the painting entered the collection of Cardinal [[Joseph Fesch]], and then in the collection of  Cramail sisters' grandfather, the [[History painting|history]] and [[Genre painting|genre]] painter Gustave Mailand (1810-1880).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Sale ==
The parish of Notre-Dame de Québec, looking to raise operating funds, approached the [[Musée de la civilisation]], the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] and the National Gallery of Canada in 2016. The cost of the painting nearly equalled the entire acquisition budget of the National Gallery (8-million).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-national-gallery-preparing-to-cancel-chagall-sale-sources/|title=National Gallery preparing to cancel Chagall sale: sources|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery of Canada has valued the painting at {{USD|5 million}}.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The asking price was {{CAD|6.3 million}}.

[[Nathalie Bondil]], director of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] has claimed that ''St. Jerome'' was not in danger of being sold to foreign buyers because that wouldn’t be allowed under Quebec’s Cultural Heritage Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-fraught-case-of-the-national-gallerys-plan-to-sell-a-chagall-painting/|title=The fraught case of the National Gallery's plan to sell a Chagall painting - Macleans.ca|last=Geddes|first=John|date=2018-04-14|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Montpetit]], Quebec's Minister of Culture and Communications announced on April 23, 2018 that  the province of Quebec issued a notice of intent to have ''Saint Jerome'' classified as a heritage document.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/heritage-painting-quebec-ottawa-1.4632736|title=Quebec will grant French painting heritage status, bringing saga to an end {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca/Pages/Article.aspx?idArticle=2604238852|title=Protection du patrimoine culturel québécois - Le Saint Jérôme de Jacques-Louis David maintenant protégé - Portail Québec|last=Québec|first=Services|website=www.fil-information.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Françoise Lyon, chair of the board, and [[Marc Mayer]], director of the National Gallery said the gallery would halt its efforts to obtain the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''San Pietro Polyptych''' (Italian: ''Polittico di San Pietro'') is a [[polyptych]] by Italian Renaissance master [[Perugino]], painted around 1496–1500. The panels are now in different locations: the [[lunette]] and the central panel, depicting the ''Ascension of Christ'', are in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], France.

==Description==
The [[polyptych]] had been originally commissioned for the [[abbey of San Pietro, Perugia|Abbey of San Pietro]] at [[Perugia]], the contract having been signed by Perugino on 8 March 1495. It included a large altarpiece and several panels, within a wooden frame by  Domenico da Verona. The altarpiece, depicting the ''Ascension of Christ'', was to have a lunette with the ''God in Glory between Angels'' above it, while the [[predella]] had not been exactly defined. The payment was 500  golden ducats, and no more than two years and a half were given to complete the work.

The panels were painted between January 1496 and the end of 1499, and the work was solemnly inaugurated on 13 January 1500. Contemporary art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] considered the predella Perugino's best work in his home city.

In 1591 the church's choir was radically restored, and the altar had to be dismantled. After the religious suppressions of 1797, the work was acquired by the French, and was divided into several French museums, although several panels remained in Perugia or went to Papal collections in Rome.

==Description==
The [[cymatium]] was separated by the main panel by a frame, in the same way of the [[Vallombrosa Altarpiece]]. At the sides were two columns which supported the frame arch and which, at the bases, were decorated by three small panels with Saints, sharing the same background.

The polyptych included the following panels:

*''Ascension'' (280 × 216&amp;nbsp;cm), now at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon. This work was almost entirely copied by Perugino and his workshop for the later [[Sansepolcro Altarpiece]]. The [[Vallombrosa Altarpiece]] also used a similar composition, in turn inspired by the now lost ''Assumption'' in the [[Sistine Chapel]].
*''God in Glory'' lunette (114 × 230&amp;nbsp;cm), now at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon. It represents God in a cloud in the sky, surrounded by [[cherubim]]s and [[seraphim]]s, and two symmetrical angels at the side.
*Tondoes of ''Jeremy'' and ''Isaiah'' (both 127&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter), now at the [[Musée des Beaux-arts de Nantes|Musée des beaux-arts]] of [[Nantes]]
*''Adoration of the Magi'' (predella panel, 32 × 59&amp;nbsp;cm). Now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts of [[Rouen]].
*''Baptism of Christ'' (predella panel, 32 × 59&amp;nbsp;cm). Now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts of [[Rouen]].
*''Resurrection'' (predella panel, 32 × 59&amp;nbsp;cm). Now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Rouen.
*''St. Herculanus'' and ''St. Constantius'' (predella panels, 32 × 38&amp;nbsp;cm). Now at the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] at  [[Perugia]].
*''St. Maurus'', ''St. Peter ad Vincula'', ''St. Scholastica'', ''St. Benedict'', ''St. Flavia'' and ''St. Placidus'' (panels at the columns base, various sizes). Now at the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] at  Perugia and the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] in [[Rome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9126">The '''Slade Professorship of Fine Art''' is the oldest professorship of [[art]] at the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University College, London|London]].

==History==
The chairs were founded concurrently in 1869 by a bequest from the art collector and philanthropist [[Felix Slade]], with [[studentship]]s also created in the University of London. The studentships allowed for the creation of the [[Slade School of Art]], now part of [[University College London]], whose Director holds the Slade Professorship. They are normally therefore a practising artist.

The chair at Oxford is a visiting professorship, with duties restricted to a series of eight public lectures per year, on the "History, Theory, and Practice of the Fine Arts",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/currentvacancies/furtherparticularsforprofessorships/sladeprofs.pdf "Slade Professorship of Fine Art"], University of Oxford, retrieved 21 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to which four seminars have been added from 2011.  The professorship is associated with [[All Souls College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/fp/sladeprofs.shtml Oxford University website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The bequest was also indirectly responsible for the foundation of the [[Ruskin School of Drawing]] in Oxford, which was financed by the first Oxford Professor, [[John Ruskin]], who announced his intention in his inaugural lecture "to the general dismay of his listeners".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OfjghCa3CnMC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=Slade+Professorship+of+Fine+Art+London&amp;ei=vrQSS_WmCI3mMO76lP0K#v=onepage&amp;q=Slade%20Professorship%20of%20Fine%20Art%20London&amp;f=false Official History of Oxford University, Vol VII]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cambridge Lectures are also a series of eight public lectures by a visiting professor.  The Oxford and Cambridge professors are most often [[art historian]]s or critics, but some artists have held the posts, especially at Oxford.  The lectures are often subsequently published in a book version.

'''Superposed order''' (also superimposed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superimposed orders|url=http://en.mimi.hu/architecture/superimposed_orders.html|publisher=en.mimi.hu|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one where successive storeys of a building have different orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superposed order|url=https://global.britannica.com/technology/superposed-order|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous ancient example of such an order is [[the Colosseum]] at Rome, which had no less than four storeys of superposed orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitham|first1=Robert|title=The Classical Orders of Architecture|date=May 12, 2014|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9781483278230|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superposition rules were  developed in ancient Greece and were also actively used in the architecture of ancient Rome. Later in the 19th century, the order was used in the architecture of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]].

==Composition==
The heaviest orders are at the bottom of a building, whilst the lightest come at the top. This rule means that the [[Doric order]] is a preferred order for the ground floor, the [[Ionic order]] is used for the middle storey, while the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or the [[Composite order]] is used for the top storey. The ground floor may also have [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Initially, the top story usually featured the Composite order, but, after [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published his treatise ''L’Idea dell’Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture'') (Venice, 1615), architects switched to the Corinthian order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СУПЕРПОЗИЦИЯ|url=http://www.rah.ru/science/glossary/detail.php?ID=19529&amp;sphrase_id=26073|website=[[The Russian Academy of Arts ]]|publisher=rah.ru|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superposed order allowed storeys without columns, but rearrangement of order styles was strictly forbidden.

'''''The Poet and the Poem''''' is an hour-long radio interview program hosted by [[Grace Cavalieri]] featuring with leading [[poets]] and sponsored by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Witter Bynner Foundation]].

==History==
The program was started in 1977 by the poet and playwright Grace Cavalieri.  The program was first broadcast from [[WPFW]] in [[Washington, DC]].  Cavalieri brought the program to the [[Library of Congress]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-018.html Library of Congress press release, 2007 July]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Poetpoem|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetpoem_about.html|publisher=www.loc.gov|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The programs archives are stored at the [[Gelman Library]] at [[George Washington University]]&lt;ref name="gwu" /&gt;

== Featured interviews ==
The show regularly features interviews with writers from across the country.  Poets featured have included [[Abhay K]], [[Francisco Aragón]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Sandra Beasley]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[Cornelius Eady]], [[Forrest Gander]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Terrance Hayes]], [[Major Jackson]], [[June Jordan]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Richard McCann]], [[E. Ethelbert Miller]], [[Naomi Shihab Nye]], [[Linda Pastan]], [[Kim Roberts]], [[Henry S. Taylor|Henry Taylor]], [[Emma Trelles]], [[David Tucker (poet)|David Tucker]], [[Dan Vera]], and [[Alice Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetpoem|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetpoem.html|publisher=www.loc.gov|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetpoem2|url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetpoem2.html|publisher=www.loc.gov|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gwu"&gt;{{cite web|title=GW Libraries at the George Washington University|url=http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/ead/ms2007.xml|website=www.gwu.edu|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Twofold movement''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Kétféle mozgás''''') is a work of art by Hungarian artist [[Ilona Keserü Ilona]] from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_002.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Its dimensions are 210 x 200&amp;nbsp;cm. This experimental work consists of two parts. The upper part contains strips of raw textiles stacked wave sewn on canvas painted with white oil paints. The lower part is oil painting on canvas, the surface is occupied by abstract black ink.  
The picture is part of the collection of the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mng.hu/kepkereso/440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The work interfaces between two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality. Since the late 1960s the artist conducted experiments to look for new ideas. Often uses textiles to emphasize spatial nature of its work. The contrast between the use of textiles and abstract expressionism emphasizes the opposition of male and female means of expression in art

{{nihongo|'''Ukiyo-e'''{{efn|The obsolete transliteration ''ukiyo-ye'' appears in older texts.}}|浮世絵||{{IPA-ja|ɯkʲijoꜜe|pron}}; literally "picture[s] of the [[ukiyo|Floating World]]"|lead=yes}} is a genre of [[Japanese art]] which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries.  Its artists produced [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] and [[Nikuhitsu-ga|paintings]] of such subjects as female beauties; [[kabuki]] actors and [[sumo]] wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; [[Flora of Japan|flora]] and [[Wildlife of Japan#Fauna|fauna]]; and [[erotica]].

[[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) became the seat of government for the [[Shōgun|military dictatorship]] in the early 17th century.  The merchant class at the bottom of [[Four occupations|the social order]] benefited most from the city's rapid economic growth.  Many indulged in the entertainments of kabuki theatre, [[oiran|courtesans]], and [[geisha]] of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The term ''[[ukiyo]]'' ("floating world") came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle.  Printed or painted ''ukiyo-e'' images of this environment emerged in the late 17th century and were popular with the merchant class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.

The earliest success was in the 1670s with [[Hishikawa Moronobu|Moronobu]]'s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women.  [[Colour printing|Colour in prints]] came gradually—at first added by hand for special commissions.  By the 1740s, artists such as [[Okumura Masanobu|Masanobu]] used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour.  From the 1760s the success of [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]]'s [[nishiki-e|"brocade prints"]] led to full-colour production becoming standard, each print made with numerous blocks.  Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]], [[Utamaro]], and [[Sharaku]] that came in the late 18th century.  In the 19th century followed a pair of masters best remembered for their landscapes: the bold formalist [[Hokusai]], whose ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' is one of the best-known works of Japanese art; and the serene, atmospheric [[Hiroshige]], most noted for his series ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]''.  Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.

Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints.  Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto [[Washi|hand-made paper]]; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works.  As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the [[Bokashi (printing)|blending or gradation of colours]] on the printing block.

Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century–especially the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  From the 1870s [[Japonism]] became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Claude Monet|Monet]], as well as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and [[Art Nouveau]] artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]].  The 20th century saw a revival in Japanese printmaking: the ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist.  Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.

==History==

===Pre-history===

Japanese art since the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) had followed two principal paths: the nativist ''{{transl|ja|[[Yamato-e]]}}'' tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the [[Tosa school]]; and Chinese-inspired ''{{transl|ja|kara-e}}'' in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic [[ink wash painting]] of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and his disciples.  The [[Kanō school]] of painting incorporated features of both.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=8–9}}

Since antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}  Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=66–67}}  Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The hand-produced nature of these ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''{{efn|{{lang|ja|仕込絵}} ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''}} limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced [[woodblock printing]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=67–68}}

During a [[Sengoku period|prolonged period of civil war]] in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants had developed.  These {{illm|Machishū|ja|町衆|lt=''{{transl|ja|machishū}}''}}{{efn|{{nihongo||町衆|{{illm|machishū|ja|町衆}} }} }} allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}}  In the early 17th century [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (1543–1616) unified the country and was appointed ''[[shōgun]]'' with supreme power over Japan.  He consolidated [[Tokugawa shogunate|his government]] in the village of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo),{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}} and required the [[Daimyō|territorial lords]] to [[Sankin-kōtai|assemble there in alternate years]] with their entourages.  The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=17}}  The village grew during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}

The centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the ''{{transl|ja|machishū}}'' and divided the population into [[Four occupations|four social classes]], with the ruling [[samurai]] class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom.  While deprived of their political influence,{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}} those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period,{{sfn|Singer|1986|p=66}} and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts—in particular [[Yoshiwara]] in Edo{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}—and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=6}}  The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}

[[Woodblock printing in Japan]] traces back to the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' in 770&amp;nbsp;CE.  Until the 17th century such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  [[Movable type]] appeared around 1600, but as the [[Japanese writing system]] required about 100,000 type pieces,&lt;!-- this doesn't mean 100,000 characters in the writing system---it means that certain characters were used multiple times on the same page, and therefore multiples of the characters had to be available to the printer --&gt; hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient.  In [[Saga Domain]], calligrapher [[Honami Kōetsu]] and publisher {{Interlanguage link multi|Suminokura Soan|ja|3=角倉素庵}} combined printed text and images in an adaptation of ''[[The Tales of Ise]]'' (1608) and other works of literature.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  During the [[Kan'ei]] era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called ''{{transl|ja|tanrokubon}}'', or "orange-green books", were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the ''{{transl|ja|[[kanazōshi]]}}'' genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=69}}  The rebuilding of Edo following the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=69–70}}

The term "ukiyo",{{efn|{{nihongo||浮世|ukiyo}} "floating world"}} which can be translated as "floating world", was [[Homophone|homophonous]] with an ancient Buddhist term signifying "this world of sorrow and grief".{{efn|{{nihongo||憂き世|ukiyo}} "world of sorrow"}}  The newer term at times was used to mean "erotic" or "stylish", among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes.  [[Asai Ryōi]] celebrated this spirit in the novel ''Ukiyo Monogatari'' ("''Tales of the Floating World''", {{circa|1661}}):{{sfn|Hickman|1978|pp=5–6}}

{{quote
|text = "living only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call ''ukiyo''."}}

===Emergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th&amp;nbsp;– early 18th centuries)===

The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of [[Japanese painting]].{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  Yamato-e painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines—this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}

[[File:Hikone Screen.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A folding screen painted with Japanese figures at play against a gold background|The [[Hikone screen]] may be the oldest surviving ukiyo-e work, dating to {{circa|1624–44}}.]]

Around 1661, painted [[Kakemono|hanging scrolls]] known as ''Portraits of Kanbun Beauties'' gained popularity.  The paintings of the [[Kanbun (era)|Kanbun era]] (1661–73), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  The paintings of [[Iwasa Matabei]] (1578–1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings.  Scholars disagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e;{{sfn|Kita|1999|p=39}} assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}  At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned [[Hikone screen]],{{sfn|Kita|1999|pp=44–45}} a ''{{transl|ja|[[byōbu]]}}'' folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works.  The screen is in a refined Kanō style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.{{sfn|Yashiro|1958|pp=216, 218}}

[[File:Moronobu b-w shunga.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a pair of lovers in splendid dress at play|Early woodblock print, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]], late 1670s or early 1680s]]&lt;!-- there is a really nice coloured version of this print on Commons.  Please don't replace this one with it, as there are few monochrome prints in the article. --&gt;

In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  By 1672, Moronobu's success was such that he began to sign his work—the first of the book illustrators to do so.  He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties.  Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series.  The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=70–71}} as well as imitators such as [[Sugimura Jihei]],{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=71–72}} and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=71}}

[[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Kaigetsudō Ando]] became prominent emulators of Moronobu's style following the master's death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school.  Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure—[[kabuki]] actors in the ''[[yakusha-e]]'' of Kiyonobu and the [[Torii school]] that followed him,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–73}} and courtesans in the ''[[bijin-ga]]'' of Ando and his [[Kaigetsudō school]].  Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–74}} and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}  The Kaigetsudō school and its popular "Kaigetsudō beauty" ended after Ando's exile over his role in the [[Ejima-Ikushima affair|Ejima-Ikushima scandal]] of 1714.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=74–75}}

Kyoto native [[Nishikawa Sukenobu]] (1671–1750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names.{{sfn|Hibbett|2001|p=69}}  Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Kansai region]]s.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  The paintings of [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] (1683–1752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours.  Chōshun made no prints.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=154}}  The [[Miyagawa school]] he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsudō school.  Chōshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included [[Hokusai]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}

===Colour prints (mid-18th century)===

Even in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions.  Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with ''tan-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||丹|tan}}: a pigment made from red lead mixed with sulphur and [[Niter|saltpetre]]{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=76}} }} prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=76–77}}  These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted ''beni-e''{{efn|{{Nihongo||紅|beni}}: a pigment produced from [[safflower]] petals.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}} }} and later the lacquer-like ink of the ''[[urushi-e]]''.  In 1744, the ''[[benizuri-e]]'' were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, the earliest ''beni'' pink and vegetable green.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}

[[File:Okumura Masanobu - Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge.png|thumb|left|Western-style [[perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]] and increased use of printed colour were amongst the innovations [[Okumura Masanobu]] claimed.&lt;br/&gt;''Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge'', {{circa|1745}}]]

A great self-promoter, [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}  He established a shop in 1707{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=16}} and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school.  Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of [[geometrical perspective]] in the ''[[uki-e]]'' genre{{efn|{{Interlanguage link multi|Torii Kiyotada|ja|3=鳥居清忠}} is said to have made the first ''uki-e'';{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}} Masanobu advertised himself as its innovator.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=78}}&lt;br /&gt;''A Layman's Explanation of the Rules of Drawing with a Compass and Ruler'' introduced Western-style geometrical perspective drawing to Japan in the 1734, based on a Dutch text of 1644 (see [[Rangaku]], "Dutch learning" during the Edo period); Chinese texts on the subject also appeared during the decade.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}&lt;br /&gt;Okumura likely learned about geometrical perspective from Chinese sources, some of which bear a striking resemblance to Okumura's works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=64–68}} }} in the 1740s;{{sfn|Suwa|1998|p=64}} the long, narrow ''hashira-e'' prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned [[haiku]] poetry.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=77–79}}

Ukiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] following a long depression.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–81}}  These popular colour prints came to be called ''[[nishiki-e]]'', or "brocade pictures", as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang [[brocade]]s, known in Japanese as ''Shokkō nishiki''.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=82}}  The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine&lt;!---or finer than standard--&gt; paper with heavy, opaque inks.  These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year{{efn|Until 1873 the [[Japanese calendar]] was [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], and each year the [[Japanese New Year]] fell on different days of the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s January or February.}} as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist.  The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=150, 152}}

The delicate, romantic prints of [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=81}} printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}} and half-tones.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry and [[Yamato-e]] painting.  The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=82–83}}  The success of Harunobu's colourful ''nishiki-e'' from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of ''benizuri-e'' and ''urushi-e'', as well as hand-coloured prints.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}}

A trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu's death in 1770.  [[Katsukawa Shunshō]] (1726–1793) and [[Katsukawa school|his school]] produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors' actual features than had been the trend.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=83}}  Sometime-collaborators [[Koryūsai]] (1735&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|1790}}) and [[Kitao Shigemasa]] (1739–1820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu's idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and [[geisha]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=84–85}}  Koryūsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 17th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|p=3}}  The [[Kitao school]] that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}}

In the 1770s, [[Utagawa Toyoharu]] produced a number of ''uki-e'' perspective prints{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=68}} that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}  Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=1922|1p=224|2a1=Neuer|2a2=Libertson|2a3=Yoshida|2y=1990|2p=259}}  In 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and [[Hiroshige]],{{sfn|Thompson|1986|p=44}} the latter a member of the [[Utagawa school]] that Toyoharu founded.  This school was to become one of the most influential,{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=204}} and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=105}}

===Peak period (late 18th century)===

[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Two Beauties with Bamboo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour print of a close-up of the head and upper torso of a finely dressed Japanese woman.  Behind her is a bamboo screen on which is depicted a similar woman's head and upper torso.|''Two Beauties with Bamboo''&lt;br/&gt;[[Utamaro]], {{circa|1795}}]]

While the late 18th century saw hard economic times,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=145}} ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the [[Kansei]] era (1789–1791).{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}  The ukiyo-e of the period of the [[Kansei Reforms]] brought about a focus on beauty and harmony{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}

Especially in the 1780s, [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815){{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} of the Torii school{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal [[diptych]]s or [[triptych]]s.  His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=85–86}}  He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=87}}

A law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold.  Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments.  From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval.{{sfn|Michener|1954|p=231}}  A group of Utagawa-school offenders including [[Utagawa Toyokuni|Toyokuni]] had their works repressed in 1801, and [[Utamaro]] was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader&lt;!-- the source calls him "Shogun", but Hideyoshi was never appointed shogun --&gt; [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}

Utamaro ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin ōkubi-e'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}  By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]] in 1797, Utamaro's prodigious output declined in quality,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=88–89}} and he died in 1806.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}

Appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic [[Sharaku]] are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}  The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  Published by Tsutaya,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}} Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=89–91}}  Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}

A consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters  of the era.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  One of Kiyonaga's followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} [[Eishi]] (1756–1829), abandoned his position as painter for ''shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] to take up ukiyo-e design.  He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  With a fine line, [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (fl. 1786–1808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans.  The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|pp=40–41}}

Edo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period.  Another major centre developed in the [[Kamigata]] region of areas in and around [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]].  In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors.  The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=38}}  Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo.{{sfn|Salter|2001|pp=12–13}}  In the 19th century many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.{{sfn|Winegrad|2007|pp=18–19}}

===Late flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century)===

[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour illustration of a violent wave|[[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', 1831]]

The [[Tenpō Reforms]] of 1841–1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and [[Katsukawa Shunchō|Shunchō]].  It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}  The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=176–177}}

The self-proclaimed "mad painter" Hokusai (1760–1849) enjoyed a long, varied career.  His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art.  Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of [[Takizawa Bakin]]'s novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Crescent Moon (novel)|ja|3=椿説弓張月|lt=Crescent Moon}}'', his series of sketchbooks, the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', and his popularization of the landscape genre with ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=92–93}} which includes his best-known print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Honour|2a2=Fleming|2y=2005|2p=709|3a1=Benfey|3y=2007|3p=17|4a1=Addiss|4a2=Groemer|4a3=Rimer|4y=2006|4p=146|5a1=Buser|5y=2006|5p=168}} one of the most famous works of Japanese art.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Belloli|2y=1999|2p=98}}  In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai's colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=158}}  Established masters [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], and [[Kunisada]] also followed Hokusai's steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=84–85}}

Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period.  The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=284–285}}  One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had.  His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular,{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}} especially his series of heroes from the ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'' (1827–1830) and ''[[Chūshingura]]'' (1847).{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=153–154}} He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}}

Hiroshige (1797–1858) is considered Hokusai's greatest rival in stature.  He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]'' and ''[[The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=94–95}} the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai's; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|pp=158–159}}  Hiroshige's followers, including [[Japanese adult adoption|adopted]] son [[Hiroshige II]] and son-in-law [[Hiroshige III]], carried on their master's style of landscapes into the Meiji era.{{sfn|King|2010|p=116}}

===Decline (late 19th century)===

Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}} and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Michener|1y=1959|1p=200|2a1=Kobayashi|2y=1997|2p=95}}  The rapid Westernization of the [[Meiji period]] that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography.  Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}}  Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1y=1997|1p=95|2a1=Faulkner|2a2=Robinson|2y=1999|2pp=22–23|3a1=Kobayashi|3y=1997|3p=95|4a1=Michener|4y=1959|4p=200}}

Synthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century.  Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called ''[[aka-e]]'' ("red pictures").{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=71}}  Artists such as [[Yoshitoshi]] (1839–1892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts,{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes.  His ''One Hundred Aspects of the Moon'' (1885–1892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=153}}  [[Kobayashi Kiyochika|Kiyochika]] (1847–1915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan's wars [[First Sino-Japanese War|with China]] and [[Russo-Japanese War|with Russia]].{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} Earlier a painter of the Kanō school, in the 1870s [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Chikanobu]] (1838–1912) turned to prints, particularly of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial family]] and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1986|pp=125–126}}

===Introduction to the West===

Aside from Dutch traders, who had had [[Japan–Netherlands relations|trading relations]] dating to the beginning of the Edo period,{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  Swedish naturalist [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement [[Dejima]], near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints.  The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=48}}

[[File:Japanese Satsuma pavillion at the French expo 1867.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of a traditional-style Japanese building|The Japanese Satsuma pavilion at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]] ]]

The arrival in Edo of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853 led to the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after [[Sakoku|over two centuries of seclusion]].  Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous;{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|pp=680–681}}  Japanese art drew notice at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]],{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=675}}  At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=12}}

Early Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and art critic [[Philippe Burty]],{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=7}} who coined the term "[[Japonism]]".{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}}{{efn|Burty coined the term ''{{lang|fr|le Japonisme}}'' in French in 1872.{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}} }}  Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of Édouard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] in 1875.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=89}}  From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine ''[[Artistic Japan]]''{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=96}} in English, French, and German editions,{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=6}} and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890 attended by artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]].{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=90}}

[[File:Debussy - La Mer - The great wave of Kanaga from Hokusai.jpg|thumb|alt=Cover of book of sheet music depicting a stylized wave|Not only the visual arts but also music drew inspiration from ukiyo-e in the West: the cover of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).]]

American [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art—Hokusai's works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=101–103}} By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors—some, such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], traded their own paintings for such prints.  [[Tadamasa Hayashi]] was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=96–97}}  The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=15}}

Japanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s.{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}}  Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s:{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} the patterned wallpapers and rugs in [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s paintings were inspired by ukiyo-e's patterned kimonos, and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=17}}  [[Vincent van Gogh|Van&amp;nbsp;Gogh]] was an avid collector, and painted [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|copies in oil]] of prints by Hiroshige and [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1989|p=230}}  Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=37–39, 45}}  Ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|pp=90–91}}  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include [[Claude Monet|Monet]],{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}} [[John La Farge|La Farge]],{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=99}} [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]],{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=96}} and [[Les Nabis]] members such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]]{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=56}} and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]].{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=67}}  French composer [[Claude Debussy]] drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Horoshige, most prominently in ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).{{sfn|Gerstle|Milner|1995|p=70}}  [[Imagism|Imagist]] poets such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Ezra Pound]] found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called ''Pictures of the Floating World'' (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.{{sfn|Hughes|1960|p=213}}

===Descendant traditions (20th century)===

[[File:Yamamoto 1904.jpg|thumb|alt=Monochromatic print of a man in a heavy coat standing, looking away from the viewer at the ocean|''Fisherman''&lt;br/&gt;[[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]], 1904]]
The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=119, 121}}  In 1915, publisher [[Shōzaburō Watanabe]] introduced the term ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  Prominent artists included [[Goyō Hashiguchi]], called the "Utamaro of the [[Taishō period]]" for his manner of depicting women; [[Shinsui Itō]], who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women;{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=22|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}} and [[Hasui Kawase]], who made modern landscapes.{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=23|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}}  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English [[Charles W. Bartlett]] (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and [[Hiroshi Yoshida]] set up studios to publish their own work.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=21}}

Artists of the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] (1882–1946), then a student at the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Arts]], is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced ''Fisherman'' using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=109}}  The foundation of the [[Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association]] in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.{{sfn|Statler|1959|p=39}}  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of [[Kōshirō Onchi]] (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of [[Un'ichi Hiratsuka]] (1895–1997).{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=35–38}}

&lt;!-- let's avoid using "kindai hanga" -- the term isn't set in stone the way "shin-hanga" and "sōsaku-hanga" are --&gt;Prints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the sōsaku-hanga movement's emphasis on individual expression.  [[Screen printing]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[mixed media]], and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers' techniques.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999}}

Bold, flat lines define and contain areas of flat colour.]]

Early ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical [[Chinese painting]]; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom.  The early ukiyo-e artists have been called "Primitives" in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques—their image designs are not considered "primitive".{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=9–11}}  Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=9}}

A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2004|1p=xiv|2a1=Michener|2y=1959|2p=11}}  The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=11–12}}  In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} with figures typically in a single plane of depth.  Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xvi}}  Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above.  Elements of images were often [[Cropping (image)|cropped]], giving the composition a spontaneous feel.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=298}}  In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}  The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome [[Ink wash painting|ink brushstrokes]] of [[zenga]] brush painting or tonal colours of the [[Kanō school]] of painting.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}

[[File:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of a tea bowl, dark-coloured, humble, and asymmetric|''[[Wabi-sabi]]'' aesthetic in a 16th-century tea bowl]]

The colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]].  Prominent amongst these, ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time;{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=50–52}} and ''[[shibui]]'' values subtlety, humility, and restraint.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=53–54}}  Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]''.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=66}}

Ukiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period.  Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the [[Akita ranga]] painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines.  The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=57–60}}  The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=62–63}}  Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=106–107}}  Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method&lt;!-- 三部構図法 --&gt; used in Buddhist pictures,&lt;!-- 仏画 --&gt; where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's ''Great Wave'', with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=108–109}}

There was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Midori Wakakura|ja|3=若桑みどり}} called a "serpentine posture",{{efn|{{lang|ja|蛇体姿勢}} ''{{transl|ja|jatai shisei}}'', "serpentine posture"}} which involves the subjects' bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves.  Art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Motoaki Kōno|ja|3=河野元昭}} posited that this had its roots in traditional [[buyō]] dance; {{Interlanguage link multi|Haruo Suwa|ja|3=諏訪春雄}} countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes.  This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=101–106}}

===Themes and genres===

Typical subjects were female beauties ("'[[bijin-ga]]'"), kabuki actors ("'[[yakusha-e]]'"), and landscapes.  The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}  The detail with which artists depicted courtesans' fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability.  Less attention was given to accuracy of the women's physical features, which followed the day's pictorial fashions—the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another.{{sfn|Hillier|1954|p=20}}  Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and [[sumo]] worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=95, 98}}  While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}

Ukiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration—many of Moronobu's earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  ''[[E-hon]]'' books of illustrations were popular{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=41}} and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume ''One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji'' and the fifteen-volume ''Hokusai Manga'', the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=38, 41}}

Traditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the [[Judaeo-Christian]] sense,{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=124}} and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, [[shunga]] erotic prints were a major genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Seton|1y=2010|1p=64|2a1=Harris|2y=2011|p=119}}  While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}  Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=64}}  As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}  Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=128}}  Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though [[Timon Screech]] posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history.  Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times.  Ukiyo-e nature prints are called ''[[kachō-e]]'', which translates as "flower-and-bird pictures", though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Hokusai's detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing ''kachō-e'' as a genre.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=134}}

The Tenpō Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans.  Aside from landscapes and ''kachō-e'', artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion.  The 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} and the 13th-century ''[[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of the Heike]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=155–156}} have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} including in ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}}  Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584–1645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] and [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=148, 153}}

From the 17th to 19th centuries [[Sakoku|Japan isolated itself]] from the rest of the world.  Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of [[Dejima]] near [[Nagasaki]].  Outlandish pictures called ''Nagasaki-e'' were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  In the mid-19th century, [[Yokohama]] became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163–164}}  Especially from 1858 to 1862 ''[[Yokohama-e]]'' prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact;{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=166–167}} triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=170}}

Specialized prints included ''[[surimono]]'', deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line [[kyōka]] poem was usually part of the design;{{sfn|King|2010|p=111}} and ''[[uchiwa-e]]'' printed [[hand fan]]s, which often suffer from having been handled.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}

{{Main|Nikuhitsu-ga}}

Ukiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours,{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xii}} and often delineated contours with [[inkstick|sumi ink]], an effect similar to the linework in prints.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=236}}  Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=235–236}}  Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as [[safflower]], ground shells, lead, and [[cinnabar]],{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=29, 34}} and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as [[Paris green]] and Prussian blue.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=35–36}}  Silk or paper  ''[[kakemono]]'' hanging scrolls, ''makimono'' [[handscroll]]s, or ''[[byōbu]]'' folding screens were the most common surfaces.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}

[[File:Yoshiiku (1862) key block face b.jpg|thumb|alt=Carved woodblock for printing|Key block for ukiyo-e print, [[Utagawa Yoshiiku]], 1862]]

{{Main article|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

Ukiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops;{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=21}}  Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=11}}  Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=61}}

Ukiyo-e prints were impressed on [[Washi|hand-made paper]]{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=11}} manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}}  The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}} to a block of cherry wood{{efn|Traditional Japanese woodblocks were cut along the grain, as opposed to the blocks of Western [[wood engraving]], which were cut across the grain.  In both methods, the dimensions of the woodblock was limited by the girth of the tree.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=34–35}}  In the 20th century, [[plywood]] became the material of choice for Japanese woodcarvers, as it is cheaper, easier to carve, and less limited in size.{{sfnm|1a1=Statler|1y=1959|1pp=34–35|2a1=Salter|2y=2001|1p=64}} }} and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The original drawing was destroyed in the process.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}}

Prints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink,{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}} applied quickly in even horizontal strokes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=225}}  Amongst the printer's tricks were [[Paper embossing|embossing]] of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=246}}  Other effects included burnishing{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}} by rubbing with [[agate]] to brighten colours;{{sfn|Frédéric|2002|p=884}} [[varnish]]ing; [[overprinting]]; dusting with metal or [[mica]]; and sprays to imitate falling snow.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}}

The ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period.  The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}}—200 in Edo alone{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=19}}—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century.  The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}} through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild.{{efn|{{nihongo||地本問屋|Jihon Toiya}} "Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild"{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}} }}{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter.  The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=18}}  Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other's wares in their shops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  In addition to the artist's seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Tsutaya Jūzaburō seal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A publisher's seal in the shape of a flower within a stylized mountain|The publisher's seal of [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]], who published [[Utamaro]] and [[Sharaku]] in the 1790s]]

Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks.  As the artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.{{sfn|Marks|2012|pp=13–14}}

In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood ''{{transl|ja|yōmyō}}'' personal name different from their ''zokumyō'' name as an adult.  An artist's name consisted of a ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' artist surname followed by an ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' personal art name.  The ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=22}} and the ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' normally took a Chinese character from the master's art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni (豊国) took the "kuni" (国) from his name, including Kunisada (国貞) and Kuniyoshi (国芳).{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers;{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=ix–x}}  Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his seventy-year career.{{sfn|Link|Takahashi|1977|p=32}}

The prints were mass-marketed{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}} and by the mid-19th century total circulation of a print could run into the thousands.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=153—154}}  Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=2011|1p=62|2a1=Meech-Pekarik|2y=1982|2p=93}}  In some cases the prints advertised [[kimono]] designs by the print artist.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}} each print stamped with the series name and the print's number in that series.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}  This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}  By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's ''Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō'' ran to dozens of prints.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}

====Colour print production====

While [[colour printing]] in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink.  Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in ''tan-e'' prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in ''beni-e'' prints.  Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour.  Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The mid-1760s brought full-colour ''nishiki-e'' prints{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} made from ten or more woodblocks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ishizawa|1a2=Tanaka|1y=1986|1p=38|2a1=Merritt|2y=1990|2p=18}}  To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly [[Printing registration|registration marks]] called ''kentō'' were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}

[[File:Pigment Berliner Blau.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a dish of deep blue powder|[[Prussian blue]] was a prominent synthetic dye in the 19th century.]]

Printers first used [[Natural dye|natural colour dyes]] made from mineral or vegetable sources.  The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from [[Primary color|primary]] red, blue, and yellow pigments.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}}  In the 18th century, [[Prussian blue]] became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}} as was ''[[bokashi (printing)|bokashi]]'', where the printer produced gradations of colour or the blending of one colour into another.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}  Cheaper and more consistent synthetic [[aniline]] dyes arrived from the West in 1864.  The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments.  The [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=234}}

==Criticism and historiography==

Contemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare.  The most significant is the ''[[Ukiyo-e Ruikō]]'' ("''Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e''"), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies.  [[Ōta Nanpo]] compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790.  The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations;{{sfn|Takeuchi|2004|pp=118, 120}} over 120 variants of the ''Ukiyo-e Ruikō'' are known.{{sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=190}}

Before World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e's founding to Moronobu.  Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th-century Yamato-e paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre's originator, and is especially favoured in Japan.  This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the Yamato-e scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}

[[File:Ernest Fenollosa.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white profile photograph of the head and shoulders of a middle-aged bearded man, facing left|American scholar of Japanese art [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the first to complete a comprehensive critical history of ukiyo-e.]]

The earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West.  Ernest Fenollosa was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886.  His ''Masters of {{not a typo|Ukioye}}'' of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th-century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige's landscapes in the 1830s.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=3–5}}  [[Laurence Binyon]], the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in ''Painting in the Far East'' in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa's, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters.  [[Arthur Davison Ficke]] built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive ''Chats on Japanese Prints'' in 1915.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=8–10}}  [[James&amp;nbsp;A. Michener]]'s ''The Floating World'' in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=12}}  For Michener and his sometime collaborator [[Richard Douglas Lane|Richard Lane]], ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=20}}  Lane's ''Masters of the Japanese Print'' of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art.  The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=13–14}}

{{Interlanguage link multi|Seiichirō Takahashi|ja|3=高橋誠一郎}}'s ''Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan'' of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict [[sumptuary law]]s that dictated what could be depicted in artworks.  The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had,{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=14–15}} and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of Yamato-e painting.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}  {{Interlanguage link multi|Tadashi Kobayashi|ja|3=小林忠}} further refined Takahashi's analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=15–16}}

Ukiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas.  Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses.  Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=13–14}}  While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=5–6}}

Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature.  Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form's greatest masters.  Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=17–18}}  Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed.  Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=19–20}}

Novelist [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e.  He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners' values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West's flaunting of the discovery.{{sfn|Yoshimoto|2003|p=65–66}}

[[File:Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white comic strip in Japanese|[[Manga]] histories often find an ancestor in the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]''.&lt;br/&gt;[[Rakuten Kitazawa]], ''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tōkyō Kenbutsu'',{{efn|''{{transl|ja|Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu}}'' {{lang|ja|田吾作と杢兵衛の東京見物}} ''Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo''}} 1902]]

Since the dawn of the 20th century historians of ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}''—Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th-century Japanese art.  Particular emphasis falls on the ''Hokusai Manga'' as a precursor, though Hokusai's book is not narrative, nor does the term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' originate with Hokusai.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=28–29}}  In English and other languages the word ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is used in the restrictive sense of "Japanese comics" or "Japanese-style comics",{{sfn|Stewart|2014|p=30}} while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=336}} and caricature.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}

==Collection and preservation==

The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=140, 175}}  Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived.  They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}  Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=149}}  Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called ''azuma-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||東絵|azuma-e}} "pictures of the Eastern capital"}} ("pictures of the Eastern capital") as souvenirs.  Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}

The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=140}}  Little concrete is known about production and consumption habits.  Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed.  Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=7–8}}

Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size,{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=216}} supply and demand,{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=31}} and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=32}}  How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|pp=216—217}}  In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 ''{{transl|ja|[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]}}''{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=151—153}} to 100 ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' for deluxe editions.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=217}}  Jun'ichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 20s and 30s of ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' were likely common for standard prints.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=43}}  As a loose comparison, a bowl of [[soba]] noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 ''mon''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1a2=Ōkubo|1y=1994|1p=217|2a1=Bell|2y=2004|2p=174}}

[[File:Ichiyōsai Yoshitaki pre-fade post-fade.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour print illustration of a Japanese woman crouching.  The image combines two photos of the same image.  The right side of the photo is faded.|Ukiyo-e prints are sensitive to light.  The left half shows this print in 1989, the right shows the same print after being on display until 2001.&lt;br/&gt;[[Utagawa Yoshitaki]], 19th century]]

The dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light; this makes long-term display undesirable.  The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with [[acid]]ic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or [[Alkalinity|alkaline]].  Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a [[relative humidity]] of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2001}}

The paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity.  Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity.  In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain [[Paulownia tomentosa|paulownia]] boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=61}}  In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution.  Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=75}}  Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.{{sfn|Toishi|1979|p=25}}

Because ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings.  There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints.  Prints may have stains, [[foxing]], wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched.  Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions.  When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=180, 183–184}}  Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002a}}  As of 2016, the record price for an ukiyo-e print sold at auction was {{€|link=yes}}{{val|745000}} for Utamaro's ''[[Fukaku Shinobu Koi]]'' ({{circa|1793–94}}).{{sfn|AFP–Jiji staff|2016}}

Ukiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions.  Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2005}}  Takamizawa Enji (1870–1927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged.  These refreshed prints he resold as original printings.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=36}}  Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who brought {{val|1500}} Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002b}}

Ukiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=313}}  Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of [[Woodblock printing in Japan#Print sizes|the standard sizes]], most commonly the {{convert|34.5|x|22.5|cm|in|adj=on}} ''aiban'', the {{convert|22.5|x|19|cm|in|adj=on}} ''chūban'', and the {{convert|38|x|23|cm|in|adj=on}} ''ōban''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}—precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=40}}

Many of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}}  Examples entered the collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] in the first half of the 19th century.  The [[British Museum]] began a collection in 1860{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=38}} that by the late 20th century numbered {{val|70000}} items.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=13–14}}  The largest, surpassing {{val|100000}} items, resides in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}} begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=39}}  The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by [[Kōjirō Matsukata]] in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War&amp;nbsp;I and later donated it to the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].{{sfn|Checkland|2004|p=107}}  The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the {{val|100000}} pieces in the [[Japan Ukiyo-e Museum]] in the [[Matsumoto, Nagano|city of Matsumoto]].{{sfn|Garson|2001|p=14}}

'''Wolf ticket''' is a literal translation of the [[Russian language]] phrase {{lang|ru|волчий билет}} (volchiy bilyet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former [[communist bloc]], usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.

Originally the phrase was used in [[Imperial Russia]] to denote a document issued in lieu of the [[internal passport]] to persons who were given a half-year postponement of [[katorga]] or [[exile]] for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.

A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an [[internal passport]] to persons released from imprisonment ("certificate of release"). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the [[101st kilometre]] rule), occupation, and so on.

The '''''Yangzhong Puffer Fish,''''' or the "Puffer Fish Tower" is a notable 295-foot long [[bronze]] statue in the shape of the [[puffer fish]].  Weighing 2,300 tons and reportedly costing $11 million, this statue sits on the banks of the [[Yangtze River]] in the [[Jiangsu Province]] of [[China]].  Work on this project was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/tp/hd2011/2013/09-27/250054.shtml |title=巨型"河豚"成江苏扬中新地标 造价达7000万元-中新网 |website=Chinanews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/world/asia/as-china-vows-austerity-giant-brass-fish-devours-11-million.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title=As China Vows Austerity, Giant Brass Fish Devours $11 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dz.xdkb.net/html/2013-09/27/content_296963.htm |title=现代快报多媒体数字报刊平台 |website=Dz.xdkb.net |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yangzhong Puffer Fish'' sculpture is the largest steel-framework sculpture in China, and perhaps the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Kaiman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/puffer-fish-statue-state-china-decadence |title=Puffer-fish statue reignites row over state decadence in China &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
