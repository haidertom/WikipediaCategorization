On display in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], in the African Art and Indian Art of the Americas, is a 19th-century [[drinking horn]]. Originally from the [[Kuba Kingdom]], the drinking horn is made out of wood, iron, and copper alloy. Drinking horns were usually a gift to the friends and family of kings or given to a warrior.

== History ==

=== Kuba Kingdom ===
{{main|Kuba Kingdom}}
[[File:Democratic Republic of Congo.png|thumb|Highlights where Congo is]]

The Kuba Kingdom, founded in the 17th century, is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It held nine provinces and chiefdoms were a part of that society.&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of Culture and Institutions: Evidence from the Kuba Kingdom, http://econ.columbia.edu/files/econ/content/kuba_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They were surrounded by other tribes such as the [[Yaka people|Yaka]], Suku, [[Pende people|Pende]], etc. The people from the Kuba kingdom were also known as the Bakuba.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; They were skilled at hunting, farming, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba background, http://kubaafricanart.weebly.com/background.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more important aspects of the Kuba kingdom was their religion. They were heavily based on the spirits of mother earth and those of their past kings.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to their religious ceremonies, the way someone was buried depended on the items placed in the coffin. For the wealthy, they had several items such as delicate figurines, masks, and drinking cups placed in their coffin.&lt;ref&gt;Kuba People, http://www.britannica.com/topic/Kuba-people&lt;/ref&gt; The detail and quality of the items told where they were in the social hierarchy.

== 19th Century Drinking Horn ==

=== Object History ===

The Kuba kingdom was located in what is known today as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The kingdom was known for their supernatural powers and spiritual beliefs. Like many kingdoms, royalty was one of the most important parts. Besides having one ruler, they had 19 other rulers underneath the king that managed the 19 groups in Kuba. One of the many ways that these kings showed their status and power was by the amount of money they spent. When it comes to drinking horns, kings would give them out to their family and friends to show their wealth and generosity. 
Drinking horns were one of the many objects that showed class. The more elegant and intrinsic the design, the higher in society they were.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolot, Alexander. "Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Kuba Kingdom, The Metropolitan Museum of Art."http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kuba/hd_kuba.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The patterns and material made for the drinking horn was an important aspect to show status. Drinking horns were typically used to drink palm wine. The intake of this beverage is an example of something that was done with events held by the king. This may also be an event in which the king shows his generosity and hands out gifts. 
The drinking horn is in the shape of a buffalo horn that symbolizes the status of the warrior that received it. The design of the horn includes patterns that are in a geometrical shape, a crocodile, and a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; This specific drinking horn has an attachment made out of iron that can be attached to a belt that the warrior would wear. The fact that the drinking horn has this accessory and option to be attached to a belt shows a high level of status within not only the Kuba society, but also the warrior community.

=== Ownership History ===

This specific drinking horn was first owned by object collector, Raoul Blondiau. He was a collector and diplomat who was based in Brussels. Blondiau is a well-known collector that is mentioned several times in many different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;The Blondiau-Theatre Arts Collection and the Harlem Renaissance, http://metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/african-art/blondiau-harlem-renaissance&lt;/ref&gt; Blondiau then sold the drinking horn to the [[Theatre Arts Monthly]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/88689&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the Harlem Museum of African Art Travelling Exhibit at that time. During the ownership of the Theater Arts Monthly, it was lent to the Chicago Children’s Museum for Negro in Art Week. It was lent during the month of December. Being a part of a traveling exhibit, the object moved around. At one point, it was lent to the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York.
In the Art Institute of Chicago’s website, it is said to have been gifted to the museum by G. F. Harding in 1928. No information has been found concerning G. F. Harding.

&lt;DIV ALIGN="justify"&gt;
'''50 Moganshan Road''' ({{zh|s=莫干山路50号}}) or "'''M50'''" is a [[contemporary art]] district in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], that houses a thriving community of more than a hundred artists whose studios are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF Moganshan Lu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214100737/http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF |date=2011-02-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely-planet"&gt;{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Pitts| title=Pocket Shanghai | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]| isbn=978-1-74179-963-7 | date=April 2013| edition=3rd | pages=86–87 | chapter=Top Sights: M50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often compared with New York's [[SoHo]] and Beijing's [[798 Art Zone]].&lt;ref name="chinaart"&gt;[http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml Shanghai SoHo--50 Moganshan Road] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820131527/http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml |date=2010-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art quarter has become a popular cultural attraction for local and international visitors alike, and was named among the top ten things to do in Shanghai by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1851908_1851830_1851818,00.html Shanghai: 10 Things to Do], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The name refers to its actual address in Shanghai, and is often shortened to M50 or Moganshan Road.  It is tucked away in an old industrial area along the [[Suzhou Creek]].  The art quarter is located in industrial and residential [[Putuo District, Shanghai|Putuo District]], but conveniently close to downtown [[Jing'an District]].

==History==
50 Moganshan Road was once the Chunming Slub Mill.  The art scene was started in 2000 by local artist Xue Song who was initially attracted by the cheap rent of the disused industrial space. Other artists including Ding Yi, Qu Fengguo, and Wang Xingwei, soon followed.&lt;ref name="artzine"&gt;[http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 Shanghai’s Blossoming Arts District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128020315/http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 |date=2012-01-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the quarter’s former factories and warehouses have been converted into art galleries, artists’ studios, design agencies and other visual art and cultural businesses of various sizes.  The land and buildings are still owned by Shangtex, the state-owned textile group that operated the now defunct factory.&lt;ref name="chinaart"/&gt;

==Artists and galleries==
M50 hosts over 120 galleries and art studios.  Some of Shanghai's best known artists work here, including [[Zhou Tiehai]], [[Ding Yi (artist)|Ding Yi]], [[Yelan (artist)|Yelan]], [[Xu Zhen (artist)|Xu Zhen]] and the media art collective [[Liu Dao]]. Galleries include [[ShanghART]], [[EastLink Gallery]], [[island6]], [[Pantocrator Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pantocratorgallery.com/ Pantocrator Gallery].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Biz Art]].&lt;ref name="artzine"/&gt;

==Transportation==
The closest [[Shanghai Metro]] station in the vicinity of M50 is [[Jiangning Road Station]] (on [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|Line 13]]), followed by [[Zhongtan Road Station]] (on [[Line 3, Shanghai Metro|Line 3]] and [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|Line 4]]).

'''Adina Bar-On''' ({{lang-he|עדינה בר-און}}), born December 19, 1951, in Kibbutz [[Kfar Blum]], Israel, is a pioneer [[performance artist]], considered to be the first performance artist in Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Active for four decades, Bar-On's work continuously explores the relationship between [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and presence, and most importantly "conflict of identity and conflicting identities".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smfa.edu/news/show/title/ADINA-BAR-ON&lt;/ref&gt; Her performances consist of unique use of human body and voice expression, close to modern dance and experimental sound techniques. Adina's work emphasizes strong connection of art and non-structural ethics of behavior, and introduces it by activating audience's high levels of attention and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;see: Idit Porat, Adina Bar-On, Performance Artist, the Herzliya Museum of Art, 2001, p.124-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Bar-On began her first performances in the early 1973 as a third year student at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. Bar-On is now a performance art teacher at Bezalel Academy's Visual Arts Department. Bar-On studied to become a painter, although was deeply involved in [[conceptual art]] movement. Her early performances took place when the notion of "performance" as a medium of art expression was not yet known in Israel. Her first performances were still called "shows"and the invitations for these events were only saying her name, time and place of the event. Those days most art critics considered performance to be a junk-art, this genre of art was not understood nor [[Process art|acknowledged by art historians and critics]].

==Controversy==
After the first performance at the courtyard of Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem, Bar-On was asked to stop doing this kind of things and academy professors called a school psychologist to examine the performer and to express professional opinion about the work. After the second performance, "Birds" (June–July 1973), Adina received a warning letter from the directors on te Academy, informing that if she wants to continue to study she has to go back to conventional mediums.&lt;ref&gt;see: Porat, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family Background==
Bar-On's parents were [[Zionism|Zionist]] American Jews who came to Israel at the beginning of this state, to set a country for a free nation to live in their own state (not in a ghetto in other nations' state). They did not come from Europe and did not escape from after-[[Holocaust]] Germany or Eastern Europe, but from free country of USA. Adina Bar-On was born in [[kibbutz]], and after some years in Israel went to America to go to secondary school. She later conceptualized her identity status in a talk "Is my Performance an Israeli Culture Manifestation?" in 2011 at Dar al- Kalima College of Art, [[Bethlehem]].

==Influences==
At the Bezalel Academy (then in the center of Jerusalem, now on the [[Mount Scopus]]) Adina was focused on painting and studied [[conceptual art]], which was becoming the most important approach in contemporary practice. During the seventies she was interested mostly in new forms of [[communication in art|communication art]] and her work was influenced by American happenings, [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], the new theater (as defined by Michael Kirby),  [[Vito Acconci]].

Bar-On found inspiration for her aesthetics in film, precisely in [[Giulietta Masina|Giulietta Masina's]] actors work, as well as in the new manner introduced by Fellini, Antonioni and Godard of seeing film-life (art-life) relationship problem.
She studied dance for some time and experimented with mime (an episode in Swiss mime actor and clown [[Dimitri (clown)|Dimitri]] in 1976 at the Dimitri School of Theatre, Vercio, Switzerland).

During these years Adina worked as therapeutist, social worker, gave courses for school art teachers, as well as performed in many different contexts: at the industry for workers, old people's houses, nurseries, private homes.
Her work was described as "strong" and "subtle" at the same time (her name, "Adina Bar-On", in Hebrew means "delicate with power") and some people recognized her new aesthetics, exceptional way of creating art as a means of human communication.

She was 23 years old when she decided to complete her academic diploma at the Bezalel despite the professors' "advice" to quit making performances, and she prepared a special, highly [[Conceptual photography|conceptual photographic work]] (black and white photographs of her color, post-expressionist paintings hung on the walls of a middle class conservative Israeli living room of her mother's house). This work already signaled some of the subjects she will be exploring later: public and private, black-and-white and color, representation and performance.

In 1974 Adina Bar-On married Daniel Davis, a [[pottery|potter]] and author of Judaica art, with whom she later often worked on some of her performances (ex. A Woman of the Pots), and made her private life a subject of the art work. Their children, Shahar Davis and Yasmin Davis, were also engaged in the preparation of "Woman of the Pots". 
Bar-On wrote in 2000 about a necessity and ethical motivation of her work: "I felt that art was losing its connection with what characterizes the human being, the ability to connect intellect with emotions".&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected performances==

==="Performance", 1973===
Adina's first performance took place in the plaza of old Bezalel Academy building, in early May 1973. Going beyond contemporary aesthetics, risking social position and artistic status, extending possibilities of communication - all these interpretations of Adina Bar-On's early performance places it on the border between avant-garde art and post-artistic performance art practice.&lt;ref&gt;described by Jerzy Ludwinski in: Jerzy Ludwiński, "Epoka Błękitu" (The Epoch of Blue), Pracownia Otwarta, Krakow 2003, {{ISBN|83-89280-05-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An incident of being mistaken for a mentally ill by Academy professors (other artists, see: section "Controversy"), showed Bar-On that her performance was indeed touching a deep level of human psyche of the audience and caused an aesthetic shock of a certain kind. At the time, most of the interpretations of art history, even aware of [[anti-psychiatric]] movement in Europe, psychoanalytical writings about [[Antonin Artaud]], experience with [[surrealism]], [[counterculture]] movement, Beuys's idea of [[social sculpture]] etc., were only taken intellectually, and misunderstood. Adina's experiment was recognized by the audience: "Very, very strong. (...) I am stired by the approach which I think should guide all of us - to touch the truth, and not in all kinds of formal, aesthetic, etc., pseudo-intellectiuallism. I don't know what art is, for I've heard from "professional connoisseurs" that this is not art. ( ... ) And I don't care if it is or it is not  if art does touch upon these problems but in a different way that enables distance, form, material, causality, inner logic (formal as well)." (Fragments of a letter Adina Bar-On received after the performance).&lt;ref&gt;Porat, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Walking On a Thin Line", 1979===
In this performance was prepared in collaboration with Ronit Land (Israeli dancer and choreographer, disciple of [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Anna Halprin]]) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dancevoices.com/index.php/he/the-dance-voices-team/160-dr-ronit-land&lt;/ref&gt; as movement consultant. It was performed at The Israel Museum of Art, Jerusalem, as well as at the Tel-Hai '80, a contemporary art event.

==="Salute", 1983===
Working in a collaboration with Ronit Land, this time Bar-On prepared a theatrical performance, moving on the edge of modern dance, theatre expression and performance art. Daniel Davis's environmental design was introduced. The premiere took place at Tel Hai, 83, Contemporary Art Event.

==="On Getting High", 1986===
"Getting high" as a goal of theater and ritual throughout the ages, the idea of inexpressible, were motifs of this six scenes of movement-play performance. Musical part of the performance involved early computer-based composition (using 3 connected synthesiser) composed by Yossi Marchaim and wordless vocalization of Adina and Robert Flantz.

==="Woman of the Pots", 1990–1991===
One of Bar-On's masterpieces, combining image, movement/dance and voice interplay. Originally performed In 1990 performance was filmed by [[Naomi Perlov]] and screened at Israel Museum. Playing with an important Israeli iconographical motive, "Woman of the Pots" was a most important collaboration with Daniel Davis.

==== Leaving "Acconci dilemma" ====
At this phase of Bar-On's development an important methodological change was: leaving art as conceptual art, and leading towards contextual art (everyday life questions raised to be subjects of the art). Saying that she left "the Acconci [[Vito Acconci]] dilemma" in performance art, Bar-On emphasised the need for new approach in performance art, where strong relations between art and life should be introduced when talking about live-art paradigm.

===''Breath'', 1994===
Performed in The Tel Aviv Museum of Art [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]. Video work for the performance was prepared by Alon Eilat.
&lt;ref&gt;Invitiation for the performance leaflet, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sacrifice", 1991===
Based on an experimental voicework (recorded and mastered later in ToTamTo Studios, Warsaw),&lt;ref&gt;Recording of voicework for "Sacrifice": https://soundcloud.com/jan-taki-jaki-jest/adina-bar-on-voicework&lt;/ref&gt; "Sacrifice" is a turning point in Bar-On's aesthetics and an example of highly sophisticated work using voice, body and image of the body. Voice is a leading creative element of not only expressing, but first of all transforming emotions (like pain) in the work of art.

A documentary film was made from the performance in Quimper, France, witnessing Adina's visit at the Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper.

Subtle level of communication is crucial for  Bar-On's performances, working with "quantum level" of emotions. Laszlo Beke (director of Research Institute of Art History,  Hungarian Academy of Science) wrote on "Sacrifice": "At the beginning after an intensive internal meditation she faced the audience (or one of its members) and waited, doing nothing, until this nothing ("tense nothing") became nearly unendurable. This is a kind of address that prepares the audience mentally and spiritually for the reception of forthcoming events".

"I'm engaged in tikkun, not from above, but in a language that everybody understands. Empathy to yourself. If you don't love and it's difficult for you now, at least have empathy."- wrote Bar-On in her autobiographical essay "A Soliloquy". "Sacrificed was performed for ten years in places including the Kuhsthalle, Budapest, Catalyst Arts Gallery: Belfast,  Para/Site Art Space: Hong-Kong,  Chasama Arts Space: New York.

==="Rest", 1999–2005===
As Bar-On described it later: "Rest is a paraphrase of a popular and old Israeli lullaby that has become mythological – "Rest For The Weary". In the Shopping Mall, Opera House [[Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center]] and Central Bus Station suspended in a vertical elevated bed, way above the heads of passers by, I move as if in a state of sleep. As in a dream, out of the subconscious, I create images by my movement and my own vocal adaptation of the old Jewish Pioneer’s song.

Placing myself in these locations I had become a provocation but more than that an image of a plea or a cry for time-out, for rest, detached from ideological idioms".&lt;ref&gt;Artist's description of the performance, available at Adina Bar-On's Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="About Love", 2004===
In ''About Love'' (close to previous "Vision") the performer was the creator of the image, and at the same time emanating certain "aura", direct communication with the audience, often felt as intervention in an intimate level of viewer's psyche, although he/she was a stranger or a passer-by. This performance was described by Bar-On's biographer, Idit Porat, as "transforming suffering into beauty".

In discussing this phase of her performance history, Adina has said: "II want to put questions of emotion on the pyre. I think this is an acute issue. I think it is what is lacking, not alienated discussions."&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 135&lt;/ref&gt;
The form of Bar-On's performances always explored delicacy, subtlety of meaning, allusions, conxeptualism, intellectual poetry, intellectual and spiritual signals going beyond symbolic levels of interpretation. In 2005, after a work "Dreamy", As Bar-On described it: "Emotions can be a material, it is my material. What do people usually do with emotions?"&lt;ref&gt;Porat, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==="40x40/Sentenced to Life"===
(lacking description)

==="Disposition", Performance Series 2001-2010===
This site-specific performance  is structured to be a journey or a walk through urban space, where Bar-On, dressed in red, is a  guide or a leader. Playing with this motif of a woman leadership and multiple meanings of space when observed through artist's eyes, mostly the borders, no-mans land's, areas of former conflicts or places of "hidden history" to be reveiled.

"Dispositions" were performed in Nachshon, Israel; Hong-Kong; Quimper, France; Helsinki, Finland; Toronto, Canada; Belfast, Northern Ireland, Oswiecim (city of Auschwitz) and Lublin, Poland.

==="Sacred", 2011-2012 and "NO MATTER", 2013 ===
After Daniel Davis's death in 2010, the artist sharpened her massage and became more direct in performance art communication process. Making performances for no more than 30 people, she focused on building strong mental contact with each spectator/witness through all channels of human expression, but now transgressing symbolism and conceptual methods. This almost "mystical strategy", [[Apophasis|apophatic]] method is now extending [[existentialism|existentialist]] implications of Bar-On's art and use of pre-expressive level in performance.&lt;ref&gt;see: entry "Pre-expressivity": "The Secret Art of Performer. A Dictionary of Theater Anthropology", ed. Eugenio Barba, Nicola Savarese, Center of Performance Research (Cardiff), Routledge (London-New York)&lt;/ref&gt;

==New ways of creating engaged art==
To create new performances in the mid-2010s, Bar-On merged everyday life situation with social symbolism, religious iconography, dream visions and mass media images. From this time Israeli and Palestinian dialogue is often a subject of the artist's work, as well as is Bar-On's own private life themes which are transported into performance art; ex. widows of the war on both sides of the conflict - Adina Bar-On's husband, Daniel Davis, died of brain tumour caused by military service in the Israeli Army. For five years he was able to express himself only by saying  "Lo!" ("No!" in Hebrew).

Starting from early performances shown at the time of [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, through 1989 when Bar-On conducted a workshop at "The Peace Frontier. International Symposium for Sculpture and  Painting", the performer is active in transporting her main subject of art - "conflict of identity and conflicting identities" - into constant [[existentialism|existential]]  practice.

Engaged in politics of the body, social role and gender from the very beginnings of her career in the 1970s, give Adina Bar-On a significant (although unconventional) role in [[feminism|feminist art]].

==Relationships and art==
Bar-On is a close friend of major performance artists and thinkers: [[Jan Swidzinski]], [[Zbigniew Warpechowski]], [[Boris Nieslony]], [[Marlyn Arsem]], with whom she is often meeting on art festivals and developed an informal group of performance artists who create [[contextual art]] in uncompromising way, with no support of the "art world" establishment, yet recognized and respected by its representatives. Her intent on working on a most fundamental level of human communication changed Bar-On's relationships with other artists and non-artists into live-art itself.

==Festivals==
As a performer Bar-On presented her work on the most important performance art festivals in the world, including  Blurr, Biennale of Performance Art: Jaffa/Tel-Aviv (many times under curatorship of Sergio Edelstein), Israel, In the Context of Art/ Differences: Warsaw, Interaction Festival: [[Piotrków Trybunalski]], Asiatopia International Performance Festival; Bangkok,  Social Art Forum: Paris, Epipederme / Performance Art event, Lisbon, Portugal, Tupada Action and Media Art, 2009/The 6th Tupada International Visual Performance Festival; Manila, Philippines, Asiatopia, International Performance Art Festival; Bangkok, Chiangmai, Thailand, Navinki 2001, Performance-Art Festival: Minsk, Belarus, International Performance Art Festival, "Castle of Imagination": Ustka-Slupsk, Poland, Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper, France, The 5th Asian Performance Art Series + Shinshu Summer Seminar 2000: Macau, Hong-Kong, and Negoya, Tokyo, Nagano in Japan, and many others.

==Later work and educational projects==
Early in her career Adina Bar-On started to teach and worked on various art educational projects focused on the language of [[visual communication]] and live-art. She has been giving numerous workshops in Israel (including Tel Aviv University, Kalisher Art School, Camera Obscura School of Art, School of Visual Theater Jerusalem, el-Hai College, Omanut La'am Art Education Organization, Holon School For The Education of Technology, Dar al- Kalima College of Art, The Academy od Dance and Music Jerusalem, [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]],  Yasmin Goder Dance Group) as well as around the world as visiting professor: at the Wroclaw Art Academy, Oswiecim Jewish Center (at the [[Oświęcim Synagogue]], [[Mobius Center in Boston|Mobius Artists Group]],  Performance Art Conference: Essen, Braunschweig University/ Department of Fine Arts, Germany, and workshop leader: Arsenal Gallery in Bialystok, Wei Wei Dance Company, Hong Kong).

One of recent major projects, such as "Aesthetics and Bias" involve institutions such as [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel Academy]], [[Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Fine Arts]] in Wrocław, [[University of Fine Arts in Poznań]], [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Warsaw Academy]], [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]], to work together in a process of developing new aesthetics.

==Adina Bar-On on film==
Starting with the performance based film "A Woman of the Pots", Bar-On prepared a number of films and [[video installation]] which are important for understanding her approach to the art: "Portrait" (1999), "View" (2001) (as an aftermath of a performance under the same name), "Room" and "Motherland" (both in 2001). 
A relationship between live-art and film/video image was already explored in "Breath" (1994) and possibly this performance leaves a trace of what the artist thinks about film representation of live-art.

Bar-On played an important role in [[Amos Gitai]] 1990 film "Birth of a Golem" (Naissance d'un golem: Carnet de notes),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=47&amp;lang=1&lt;/ref&gt; giving an expressive improvised performance in the movie, and appearing on a screen in the moment when the story of a Golem is told. She also helped to direct [[Annie Lennox]] in her role as Golem's figure in the cave scene.

Adina Bar-On's full documentation of work on film in now hosted by The Art of Action Archives, organization focused on anthropological research and preservation of performance art masterpieces.

==Students' work==
During the years of teaching about visual communication, Bar-On managed to contact young artists of different sensitivity and working on future aesthetics of a new era. Still not theoretically described nor defined aesthetics of Bar-On is an inspiration for new generation of artists.

[[Image:Goya-El sueño de la razón.jpg|thumb|''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'', [[Francisco Goya]] (1799) – created using aquatint (notice shaded background) and etching techniques]] 
{{History of printing}}

'''Aquatint''' is an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printmaking]] technique, a variant of [[etching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aquatint|title=Aquatint - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a [[printing press]] together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.

Like [[etching]], aquatint uses the application of a [[mordant]] to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered [[rosin]] to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Another tonal technique, [[mezzotint]], begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.

== History ==
The painter and printmaker [[Jan van de Velde|Jan van de Velde IV]] invented the aquatint technique in [[Amsterdam]], around 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Hind AM (1963) A History of Engraving and Etching. Dover Publications, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartographer [[Peter Perez Burdett]] later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann V. Gunn, "Sandby, Greville and Burdett, and the 'Secret' of Aquatint," ''Print Quarterly,'' XXIX, no. 2, 2012, pp. 178-180.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States the printmaker [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919–40), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=67, 91 notes 355–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
[[File:Boîte à aquatinte.jpg|thumb|aquatint box, used to apply resin powder on the plate.]]
An aquatint requires a metal plate, an [[acid]], and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates were used. The artist applies a ''ground'' that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered [[resin]] in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as "the ground."

An aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.

The plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the "bite") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).
[[File:Plaque et resine.JPG|thumb|Zinc plate with powder resin.]]

At some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant "stop out" (also called an [[asphaltum]] or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.

The artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious [[cross-hatching]]; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.

The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.

Contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as [[sugar-lift]]. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image "lifts off" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.

An '''arcade''' is a succession of contiguous [[arch]]es, with each arch supported by [[column]]s, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. Exterior arcades are designed to provide a sheltered walkway for pedestrians. The walkway may be lined with retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An arcade may feature arches on both sides of the walkway. Alternatively, a [[blind arcade]] superimposes arcading against a solid wall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3FN4VL5lEwC&amp;pg=PA865 James Bettley and Nikolaus Pevsner (2007), ''Essex. The buildings of England'', Yale University Press, page 865]&lt;/ref&gt; Blind arcades are a feature of [[Romanesque architecture]] that influenced [[Gothic architecture]]. In the Gothic architectural tradition, the arcade can be located in the interior, in the lowest part of the wall of the [[nave]], supporting the [[triforium]] and the [[clerestory]] in a [[cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;William Chambers (1973), ''Chambers's encyclopaedia, Volume 1'', International Learning Systems Corp, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; or on the exterior, in which they are usually part of the walkways that surround the [[courtyard]] and [[cloisters]]. 

Many medieval arcades housed shops or stalls, either in the arcaded space itself, or set into the main wall behind.  From this, "arcade" has become a general word for a group of shops in a single building, regardless of the architectural form. 

The word "arcade" comes from [[French language|French]] ''arcade'' from [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''arcada'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''arcata'', based on [[Latin]] ''arcus'', ‘bow’ (see arc and [[arch]]).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Arcades go back to at least the [[Ancient Greek architecture]] of the [[Hellenistic period]], and were much used by the Romans, for example at the base of the [[Colosseum]].  Church [[cloister]]s very often use arcading. [[Islamic architecture]] very often uses arcades in and outside [[mosque]]s in particular.  In [[Renaissance architecture]] elegant arcading was often used as a prominent feature of facades, for example in the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] (commissioned 1419) or the courtyard of the [[Palazzo Bardi]], both by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] in [[Florence]].

==Shopping arcades==
The French architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as ''l’Ère des passages couverts'' (the Arcade Era).&lt;ref&gt;Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: Délégation à l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to the grand shopping "arcades" that flourished across Europe during that period. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th and 19th century arcades were designed to attract the genteel middle classes. In time, these arcades became to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the harsh elements, and a safe haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid-nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Firenze, loggia del Mercato Nuovo (03).jpg|thumb|Loggia del Mercato Nuovo, Florence, Italy]]
The inspiration for the grand shopping arcades may have derived from the open [[loggia]]s of Florence. During the 16th-century, a pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was established in Florence, from where it spread throughout Italy. Examples of the earliest open [[loggia]]s include: [[Loggia del Mercato Nuovo|Mercato Nuovo]] (1547) by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]); Mercato Vecchio, Florence by [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1567) and [[Loggia del Grano, Florence|Loggia del Grano]] (1619) by [[Giulio Parigi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N., ''A History of Building Types,'' Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 235; Goy, R.J., ''Florence: A Walking Guide to Its Architecture,'' Yale University Press, 2015; Codini, E.K. (ed), ''Architettura a Pisa nel Primo Periodo Mediceo, Gangemi, 2003, p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcades soon spread across Europe, North America and the Antipodes. Examples of these grand shopping arcades include: [[Palais Royal]] in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791); London's [[Piccadilly Arcade]] (1810) and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II|Galleria Vittorio Emanuele]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics,'' Sage, 2007, p. 27; Although the author specifically names Piccadilly Arcade, it is possible that she intended [[Burlington Arcade]] in Piccadilly. &lt;/ref&gt; Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]] in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847 and Istanbul's [[Çiçek Pasajı]] opened in 1870. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern [[shopping mall]], and the word "arcade" is now often used for malls which do not use the architectural form at all.

The [[Palais-Royal]], which opened in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example of the grand shopping arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, a royal palace, the complex consisted of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the earliest British examples of a shopping arcade, the [[Covered Market, Oxford]], England was officially opened on 1 November 1774 and is still active today.  The Covered Market was started in response to a general wish to clear "untidy, messy and unsavoury stalls" from the main streets of central Oxford. [[John Gwynn (architect)|John Gwynn]], the architect of [[Magdalen Bridge]], drew up the plans and designed the High Street front with its four entrances. In 1772, the newly formed Market committee, half of whose members came from the town and half from the university, accepted an estimate of nine hundred and sixteen pounds ten shillings, for the building of twenty butchers' shops. Twenty more soon followed, and after 1773 meat was allowed to be sold only inside the market. From this nucleus the market grew, with stalls for garden produce, pig meat, dairy products and fish.

[[Great Gostiny Dvor|Gostiny Dvor]] in [[St Petersburg]], [[Russia]] is another early shopping arcade.&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?q=%22One+of+the+oldest+shopping+arcades+in+the+world&amp;btnG=Search+Books--&gt; Sprawling at the intersection of [[Nevsky Prospekt]] and [[Sadovaya Street]] for over one kilometer and embracing the area of {{convert|53000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] design submitted by [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] (1729–1800).

Throughout the following century, Gostiny Dvor was augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. During the post-[[World War II]] reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being. This massive 18th-century structure got a face-lift recently and entered the 21st century as one of the most fashionable shopping centres in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanov, I.A. , ''Bolshoi Gostiny dvor v Peterburge''. SPb, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

An early French arcade is the Passage du Caire created in 1798 as a tribute to the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]]. It was appreciated by the public for its protection from the weather, noise and filth of the streets.&lt;ref&gt;p. 174 Desmons, Gilles ''Walking Paris'' New Holland Publishers, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later American architect William Thayer created the [[Passage des Panoramas]] with a row of shops passing between two [[panorama]] paintings. Shopping arcades increasingly were built in the second [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 386 Ayers, Andrew  ''The Architecture of Paris: An Architectural Guide'' Edition Axel Menges, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Upper levels of arcades often contained apartments&lt;ref&gt;p. 32 Benjamin, Walter &amp; Tiedemann, Rolf ''The Arcades Project'' Harvard University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes [[brothel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p. 88 Rabaté, Jean-Michel ''Given: 10 Art 20 Crime : Modernity, Murder and Mass Culture'' Sussex Academic Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Baronci Altarpiece''''' was a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. His first recorded commission, it was made for Andrea Baronci's chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in [[Città di Castello]], near [[Urbino]]. The [[altarpiece]] was seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789, and since 1849 fragments of the original painting have been part of different collections.

==History==
On December 10, 1500, Raphael and [[Evangelista da Pian di Meleto]], an older painter from the workshop of Raphael's father [[Giovanni Santi]], received the commission to paint jointly a large altarpiece dedicated to [[Nicholas of Tolentino|Saint Nicholas of Tolentino]], for the Baronci chapel in the Sant'Agostino Church in [[Città di Castello]]. In the documents Raphael, not his collaborator, is referred to as ''magister'' ("master"). The work on the paintings was completed on September 13, 1501.

In the center of the painting Nicholas of Tolentino stood in an archway, with the devil at his feet. Next to him were three angels. Above him [[God the Father]] was placed with a crown in his hand, and surrounded by the heads of angels. On his left the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] were painted.

During a heavy earthquake in 1789 the painting was damaged so severely that it was decided to saw it into pieces and display only the undamaged parts. In the same year, the fragments were acquired by [[Pope Pius VI]] for the [[Vatican Museums|collections of the Vatican]], where they remained until 1849. It is unclear what happened to them after that. Only many years later scholars were able to trace back six different pieces, four fragments of the main painting and two [[predella]]s, which had become part of different collections.

An impression of the complete work is given by an 18th-century copy in the [[Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello]]. Preliminary sketches by Raphael can be found in the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts|Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]], [[Lille]] and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]. On the basis of these drawings it is assumed that the design of the altar was entirely Raphael's work, whereas in the execution he was joined by Evangelista da Pian di Meleto. While Raphael probably painted the altarpiece itself, the predellas are attributed to Pian di Meleto.

'''Book trimming''' is the stage of the [[book]] production process in which the [[Page (paper)|page]] edges of a book are trimmed so that all pages will stack with perfect edge alignment within the finished book jacket.

The step before book trimming is the [[book binding|binding]] of the folded printing sheets. Trimming is performed either with a hydraulic book trimmer that is able to cut a whole book in one or two passes or, until the invention of hydraulic book trimmers, with a cutting press (or lying press) and [[Plough (bookbinding)|plough]].

==Cutting principles==

===Knife cut principle===
The book cutting machine works with three knives and use the knife cut principle. The knife cut principle operates with only one knife per edge which cuts against a rubber surface. This surface supported the cut force. The three-knife-trim is performed in one step. The block is aligned and fixed by the pressure bar. The three knives cut all edges but except the spine; new machines need only one step.

===Shear cut principle===
The shear cut principle works with two knives – upper and bottom knife. The bottom knife is fixed and the upper knife works against the fixed one. Example of the shear cut principle is the cut of the paper web in the web offset machine and this is realized by a circular blade. To cut simple brochures (booklets) is used by a trimmer which works in two steps.

===Burst cut===
The third principle is the burst cut. This knife does not need a counter-acting tool. The required cut force is generated by the clamping force of the clamped paper. &lt;ref&gt;Kipphan, H. 2001. ''Handbook of print media: technologies and production methods'', Vol. 1, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cluster Paintings''''' are a [[Serial imagery|series]] of [[painting]]s created by [[Nabil Kanso]] in 1986-1988. They are characterized by [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s that divide the [[canvas]] space into sections reflecting a cluster of irregular shaped [[Plane (geometry)|planes]] offering variations of contrasts and viewpoints. These characteristics expanded in later works such as the [[America 500 Years|America]] and [[Living Memory (paintings)|Living Memories]] series.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cluster Paintings: Cluster Matter Floating in Spaces of Shades'', pp. 82 – 102 in Nabil Kanso the Split of Life Paintings, NEV Editions, Atlanta 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kansoamerica.com/text.html Notes on the Cluster paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Contributor License Agreement''' ('''CLA''') defines the terms under which [[intellectual property]] has been contributed to a company/project, typically [[software]] under an [[open source license]].

== Rationale ==

CLAs can be used to enable vendors to easily pursue legal resolution in the case of copyright disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/licenses/|title=Licenses|author=|date=|website=www.apache.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to relicense products to which contributions have been received from third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/ContributingFAQ|title=Contributing FAQ|author=|date=|website=mysql.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a CLA is to ensure that the guardian of a project's outputs has the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow them to distribute under the chosen license. In some cases this will mean that the contributor will assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner; in other cases, they will grant an irrevocable licence to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution. CLAs also have roles in raising awareness of [[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] issues within a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml |title=Contributor Licence Agreements |publisher=Oss-watch.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canonical ===

The Canonical contributor agreement was a Contributor License Agreement required by [[Canonical Ltd]] for all contributions to many projects established by Canonical.

In it, the contributor assigned copyright to Canonical and at the same time Canonical gave the contributor "a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual right to use, copy, modify, communicate and make available to the public (including without limitation via the Internet) and distribute, in each case in an original or modified form, the Assigned Contributions as (they) wish."&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | accessdate = 2010-12-31 | title = Canonical's contributor agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.canonical.com/static/files/Canonical_Contributor_Agreement_ver_2.5.pdf|title = Contributor Agreement V2.5 |accessdate = 31 December 2010|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canonical started Project Harmony "...to assist organisations which use contribution agreements by providing standardised variable templates with clear and concise explanations...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opensource.com/law/10/6/project-harmony-looks-improve-contribution-agreements-0 | title = Project Harmony looks to improve contribution agreements | date = 2010-06-24 | author = Amanda Brock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, Canonical is requesting contributions be licensed under a Harmony Contribution Licence Agreement, rather than the copyright being assigned to Canonical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | title = Canonical's contributor agreement | date = 2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Harmony CLA, "the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects."&lt;ref name="canonical.com"/&gt;

'''Creative [[Problem solving|problem-solving]]''' is the mental process of searching for an original and previously unknown solution to a problem. To qualify, the solution must be novel and reached independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punya.educ.msu.edu/presentations/creativityworkshop/group-dynamics-assignment|title=Creative problem solving for teachers|author=Michigan State University}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative solution types ==
The process of creative problem-solving usually begins with defining the problem. This may lead to finding a simple non-creative solution, a textbook solution, or discovering prior solutions developed by other individuals. If the discovered solution is sufficient, the process may then be abandoned&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeeducationfoundation.org/creative-problem-solving/ Definition of creative problem solving] on Alex Osborn's (inventor of the term and process of [[brainstorming]]) Creative Education Foundation website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~dusana/psych325presession/notes/CH11.ppt&amp;ei=CG7kUMmLLof44QSF3oCwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIBTx2KJRqQEGiABvCJuPAPSkkuQ&amp;sig2=OIt8RA3BVdpyqHigVwilwQ&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.bGE Problem definition]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in presentation on creative problem-solving, on the [[University of Arizona]] website&lt;/ref&gt;.

A creative solution will often have distinct characteristics that include using only existing components, or the problematic factor, as the basis for the solution. However, a change of perspective may in many cases be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativethinkingassoc.com/mikevance.html Mike Vence about the 9 dots as a corporate promotion of creative thinking] at the [[Walt Disney Company]] (Creative Thinking Association website)&lt;/ref&gt; A solution may also be considered creative if readily available components can be used to solve the problem within a short time limit&lt;ref&gt;[http://wmsci2012.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/enhanced-creativity-and-problem-solving-an-interdisciplinary-approach/ About creative problem solving] in an invitation to a conference by the [[University of South Alabama]]&lt;/ref&gt; (factors typical to the solutions employed by the title character in the television series [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]).

If a creative solution has broad application – that is, uses that go beyond the original intent –, it may be referred to as an innovative solution, or an [[innovation]] (some innovations may also be considered an [[invention]]).
{{quote|text="All innovations [begin] as creative solutions, but not all creative solutions become innovations."&lt;ref name=fobes1993&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Fobes|title=The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox: A Complete Course in the Art of Creating Solutions to Problems of Any Kind|year=1993|ISBN=0-9632221-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; |author=Richard Fobes}}

== Techniques and tools ==
Many techniques and tools employed for creating effective solutions to a problem are described in [[creativity techniques]] and [[problem-solving]] articles.

=== Creative problem-solving technique categories ===
* '''Mental state shift and cognitive re-framing''': Changing one’s focus away from active problem-solving and towards a creative solution set.
* '''Multiple idea facilitation''': Increasing the quantity of fresh ideas based on the belief that a greater number of ideas will raise the chances that one of these is valuable. This may include randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word from a list) and thinking about its similarities to the situation. In turn, this random act may inspire a related idea that would lead to a solution.
* '''Inducing a change of perspective''': Efficiently entering a fresh perspective may result in a solution that thereby becomes obvious. This is especially useful for solving particularly challenging problems.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt; Many techniques to this end involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate closely associated concepts.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt; Differentiating concepts helps overcome a tendency to use oversimplified associative thinking, in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences are overlooked.&lt;ref name=fobes1993 /&gt;

One of the first streams of [[Romanesque architecture]] in Europe from the 10th century and the beginning of 11th century is called '''First Romanesque''' or '''Lombard Romanesque'''. It took place in the region of [[Lombardy]] and spread into [[Catalonia]] and into the south of [[France]]. Its principal decoration for the exterior, bands of ornamental blind arches are called [[lombard band]]s. It was characterized by thick walls and lack of sculpture in facades, and with interiors profusely painted with frescoes.

During the first quarter of the 11th century, much architectural activity by groups composed of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] teachers and stonemasons (''[[Comacine masters|Comacine Guild]]''), who worked throughout much of [[Europe]] and Catalan territories and erected fairly uniform temples, some of which still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Santa Maria de Roses|Monastery of Santa Maria de Roses]] of 1022 is the oldest of the Lombard features in Catalonia.&lt;/ref&gt; For a considerable area this process of craft diffusion started in [[Lombardy]] and ''Lombardus'' became the word for ''mason'' at an early period.&lt;ref name=KJC&gt;{{cite book|title=Carolingian and Romanesque |first=Kenneth John |last=Conant |date=1959 |place=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might call the First Romanesque style the style of this Italian architectural reconquest.&lt;ref name=KJC/&gt; The large promoter and sponsor of this art in Catalonia was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]], monk and abbot of the [[Santa Maria de Ripoll|monastery of Ripoll]] who, in 1032, ordered the extension of the body of this building with a façade with two towers, plus a transept which included seven apses, all decorated on the outside with the Lombardic ornamentation of blind arches and vertical strips.

Catalan architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] suggested that what was formerly considered the late form of [[pre-Romanesque]] architecture in [[Catalonia]] bore features of Romanesque and thus classified it as First Romanesque (''primer romànic''). The First Romanesque churches of the [[Vall de Boí]] were declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in November 2000.

The geographical proximity of this [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] region to the rest of [[Europe]], resulted in depictions of the emerging [[Romanesque art]] being brought to Catalonia. While the art failed to take root in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula until the second third of the 11th century, there are numerous examples of its presence in [[Catalan counties]] before this time. Though this style may not be considered fully Romanesque, the area contained many of the defining characteristics of this artistic style.

To avoid the term Pre-Romanesque, which is often used with a much broader meaning than is generally suited to refer to early Medieval and [[Early Christian art and architecture|early Christian art]], and in Spain may also refer to the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]], [[Asturian architecture|Asturias]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] and [[Repoblación art and architecture|Repoblación]] art forms, Puig i Cadafalch preferred to use the term "First Romanesque" or "first Romanesque art" to designate those Catalan anticipations of the Romanesque itself.

'''Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi''' (''Fountain of the Four Rivers'') is a fountain in the [[Piazza Navona]] in [[Rome]], Italy. It was designed in 1651 by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] for [[Pope Innocent X]] whose family palace, the [[Palazzo Pamphili]], faced onto the piazza as did the church of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] of which Innocent was the sponsor.

The base of the fountain is a basin from the centre of which travertine rocks rise to support four river gods and above them, a copy of an [[Egypt]]ian [[obelisk]] surmounted with the Pamphili family emblem of a dove with an olive twig. Collectively, they represent [[four rivers (disambiguation)|four major rivers]] of the [[four continents]] through which papal authority had spread: the [[Nile]] representing Africa, the [[Danube]] representing Europe, the [[Ganges]] representing Asia, and the [[Río de la Plata]] representing the Americas.

==Design==
Bernini's design was selected in competition. The circumstances of his victory are described as follows in [[Filippo Baldinucci]]'s ''The life of Cavaliere Bernini'' (1682):
{{quote|text=So strong was the sinister influence of the rivals of Bernini on the mind of Innocent that when he planned to set up in Piazza Navona the great [[obelisk]] brought to Rome by the Emperor Caracalla, which had been buried for a long time at [[Capo di Bove]] for the adornment of a magnificent fountain, the Pope had designs made by the leading architects of Rome without an order for one to Bernini. Prince [[Niccolò Ludovisi]], whose wife was niece to the pope, persuaded Bernini to prepare a model, and arrange for it to be secretly installed in a room in the Palazzo Pamphili that the Pope had to pass. When the meal was finished, seeing such a noble creation, he stopped almost in ecstasy. Being prince of the keenest judgment and the loftiest ideas, after admiring it, said: "This is a trick … It will be necessary to employ Bernini in spite of those who do not wish it, for he who desires not to use Bernini’s designs, must take care not to see them."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060927102116/http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/arthumanities/pdfs/arthum_bernini_reader.pdf The life of Cavaliere Bernini]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Public fountains in Rome served multiple purposes: first, they were highly needed sources of water for neighbors in the centuries prior to home plumbing. Second, they were monuments to the papal patrons. Earlier Bernini fountains had been the [[Fountain of the Triton]] in [[Palazzo Barberini|Piazza Barberini]], the [[Fontana del Moro|Fountain of the Moor]] in the southern end of Piazza Navona erected during the Barberini papacy, and the [[Neptune and Triton]] for Villa Peretti Montalto, whose statuary now resides at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]].

Each has animals and plants that further carry forth identification, and each carries a certain number of [[allegories]] and [[metaphors]] with it. The Ganges carries a long oar, representing the river's [[navigability]]. The Nile's head is draped with a loose piece of cloth, meaning that no one at that time knew exactly where the Nile's source was. The Danube touches the [[Papal coats of arms|Pope's personal coat of arms]], since it is the large river closest to Rome. And the [[Río de la Plata]] is sitting on a pile of coins, a symbol of the riches America could offer to Europe (the word ''[[:wiktionary:plata|plata]]'' means "silver" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Also, the Río de la Plata looks scared by a [[snake]], showing rich men's fear that their money could be stolen. Each is a [[river god]], semi-prostrate, in awe of the central tower, epitomized by the slender Egyptian [[obelisks in Rome|obelisk]], symbolizing by Papal power surmounted by the Pamphili symbol (dove). In addition, the fountain is a theater in the round, a spectacle of action, that can be strolled around. Water flows and splashes from a jagged and pierced mountainous disorder of [[travertine marble]]. A legend, common with tour-guides, is that Bernini positioned the cowering Rio de la Plata River as if the sculpture was fearing the facade of the [[Sant'Agnese in Agone|church of Sant'Agnese]] by his rival [[Borromini]] could crumble against him; in fact, the fountain was completed several years before Borromini began work on the church.

The obelisk, made of [[Aswan]] [[granite]], has an interesting history. It is connected with the emperor [[Domitian]], and was originally thought to have come from the [[Serapeum]], which the emperor rebuilt in A.D. 80. However, it is equally plausible that the obelisk might have originated from the [[Temple of the gens Flavia|Temple of the Gens Flavia]] on the [[Quirinal Hill]], built by Domitian dedicated to his [[Flavia (gens)|family cult]]. The [[hieroglyph]]ic inscriptions on the obelisk were of Roman authorship, offering a hymn to Domitian, and the deified emperors [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]], possibly on the occasion of something being restored. In the fourth century, the obelisk was relocated to the [[Circus of Maxentius|Circus]] of the emperor [[Maxentius]], located between the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Church of St. Sebastian]] and the [[Tomb of Caecilia Metella|tomb of Cecilia Metella]] along the [[Appian Way]], where it was found and moved to the Fountain. The circus – as well as the nearby [[Mausoleum of Maxentius|villa and mausoleum]] – was first believed to be attributed to the emperor [[Caracalla]], until excavations carried out by [[Antonio Nibby]] in 1825, in which an inscription identifying the ownership of the site was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rome – an Oxford Archaeological Guides|last=Claridge|first=Amanda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0192880039|location=New York|pages=211, 336–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At each of the four sites of the obelisk is a tablet, containing Kircher's translation into Latin of its hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777122590/3573_obelisk_lg.html|title=FATHOM: Image Gallery|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamic fusion of architecture and sculpture made this fountain revolutionary when compared to prior Roman projects, such as the stilted designs [[Acqua Felice]] and [[Acqua Paola|Paola]] by [[Domenico Fontana]] in [[San Bernardo alle Terme|Piazza San Bernardo]] (1585–87) or the customary embellished geometric floral-shaped basin below a jet of water such as the [[Fontanina]] in Piazza Campitelli (1589) by [[Giacomo della Porta]]. [[Bernini]]'s design was influenced by the design of the [[Monument of the Four Moors]] (''Monumento dei Quattro mori'') and it may have also been influenced by a fountain in [[Marino, Lazio]] which was constructed to commemorate the defeat of the Ottomans at Lepanto in 1571.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bindman|author2=Henry Louis Gates|author3=Karen C.

==Unveiling==

The Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was unveiled to the populace of Rome on 12 June 1651. According to a report from the time,&lt;ref name = "multiple"&gt;{{cite book|first=Antonio |last=Bernal|title=Copiosissimo Discorso della Fontana, e Guglia Eretta in Piazza Navona, per ordine della Santità di Nostro Signore Innocentio X dal Signor Cavalier Bernini ...|location=Rome|year=1651}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event was organised to draw people to the [[Piazza Navona]]. Beforehand, wooden scaffolding, overlaid with curtains, had hidden the fountain, though probably not the obelisk, which would have given people an idea that something was being built, but the precise details were unknown. Once unveiled, the full majesty of the fountain would be apparent, which the celebrations were designed to advertise. The festival was paid for by the [[Pamphili]] family, to be specific, [[Innocent X]], who had sponsored the erection of the fountain. The most conspicuous item on the Pamphili crest, an olive branch, was brandished by the performers who took part in the event.

The author of the report, Antonio Bernal, takes his readers through the hours leading up to the unveiling. The celebrations were announced by a woman, dressed as the allegorical character of [[pheme|Fame]], being paraded around the streets of Rome on a carriage or float. She was sumptuously dressed, with wings attached to her back and a long trumpet in her hand. Bernal notes that "she went gracefully through all the streets and all the districts that are found among the seven hills of Rome, often blowing the round bronze [the trumpet], and urging everyone to make their way to that famous Piazza." A second carriage followed her; this time another woman was dressed as the allegorical figure of [[Curiosity]]. According to the report, she continued exhorting the people to go towards the piazza. Bernal describes the clamour and noise of the people as they discussed the upcoming event.

The report is actually less detailed about the process of publicly unveiling the fountain. However, it does give ample descriptions of the responses of the spectators who had gathered in the Piazza. Once there, Bernal notes, the citizens of the city were overwhelmed by the massive fountain, with its huge lifelike figures. The report mentions the "enraptured souls" of the population, the fountain, which "gushes out a wealth of silvery treasures" causing "no little wonder" in the onlookers. Bernal then continues to describe the fountain, making continuous reference to the seeming naturalism of the figures and its astonishing effect on those in the piazza.
[[File:Fountain of the Four Rivers - river god Ganges (Rome).jpg|centre|950px|thumbnail|Fountain of the Four Rivers by night – river god Ganges in the front.]]
The making of the fountain was met by opposition by the people of Rome for several reasons. First, Innocent X had the fountain built at public expense during the intense famine of 1646–48. Throughout the construction of the fountain, the city murmurred and talk of riot was in the air. [[Pasquinade]] writers protested the construction of the fountain in September 1648 by attaching hand-written invectives on the stone blocks used to make the obelisk. These pasquinades read, "We do not want Obelisks and Fountains, It is bread that we want. Bread, Bread, Bread!" Innocent quickly had the authors arrested, and disguised spies patrol the Pasquino statue and Piazza Navona&lt;ref&gt;the diary of Giacinto Gigli, ''Diario di Rome'', vol. II, pp. 533–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The streetvendors of the market also opposed the construction of the fountain, as Innocent X expelled them from the piazza. The Pamphilij pope believed they detracted from the magnificence of the square. The vendors refused to move, and the papal police had to chase them from the piazza. Roman Jews, in particular, lamented the closing of the Navona, since they were allowed to sell used articles of clothing there at the Wednesday market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Cancellieri]], ''Il Mercato, il Lago dell'Acqua Vergine, ed il Palazzo Panfiliano nel circo agonale, detto volgarmente Piazza Navona''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gus Green Van Sant Jr.'''&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; (born July 24, 1952) is an American film director, screenwriter, painter, photographer, musician, and author who has earned acclaim as both an [[independent film|independent]] and [[mainstream media|mainstream]] filmmaker. His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent [[auteur]]s of the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement.

Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with ''[[Mala Noche]]'' (1985). His second feature ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] and [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the award for Best Director from the [[National Society of Film Critics]]. His following film, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), was similarly praised, as was the [[black comedy]] ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), the drama ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997), and the biographical film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and both films received [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominations.

In 2003, Van Sant's film about the [[Columbine High School massacre]], ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'', won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. Van Sant also received the festival's [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]]—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4071982/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Elephant |accessdate=2009-11-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000) and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' (2007), some of his efforts, such as the [[art film|art house production]] ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005) and the environmental drama ''[[Promised Land (2012 film)|Promised Land]]'' (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]'s ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' (1994), his [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', and ''[[The Sea of Trees]]'' (2015), were critical and commercial failures.

In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled [[Pink (Van Sant Novel)|''Pink'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''Pink'', Faber &amp; Faber, 1998, {{ISBN|0-385-49353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of his photography, called ''108 Portraits'',&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''108 Portraits'', Twin Palms Pub., 1993, {{ISBN|0-944092-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been published, and he has released two musical albums. He is openly gay and currently lives in [[Los Feliz, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|title = Interview with Openly Gay Filmmaker Gus Van Sant|website = [[About.com]]|date = November 11, 2015|last = Brandao|first = Rodrigo|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160813164931/http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|archivedate = August 13, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Van Sant was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant Sr; Gus's father was a clothing manufacturer and traveling salesman,&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant Biography (1952?-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Gus-Van-Sant.html|work=film reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=film reference|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity, holding executive marketing positions that included being president of the [[White Stag (clothing)|White Stag Manufacturing Company]]'s Apparel Operation.&lt;ref name=changes-white-stag&gt;{{cite news|title=Changes in Management Disclosed by White Stag|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=December 5, 1969|location=Portland, Oregon|at=Section 1, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his father's job, the family moved continually during Van Sant's childhood.

His paternal family is of partial Dutch origin; the name "Van Sant" is derived from the Dutch name "Van Zandt". The earliest Van Zandt arrived in the [[New Netherland]] area in the early 17th century, around what is now New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/gus-green-van-sant-jr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Sant is an alumnus of [[Darien High School]] in [[Darien, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darien High School|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/15519|work=Public School Review|publisher=Public School Review|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2003–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Catlin Gabel School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant- Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/gus-van-sant/biography.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|publisher=Yahoo!, Inc|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One constant in the director's early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and [[Super-8]] filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Rebecca Flint|title=Gus van Sant Biography|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1982–1989: Early career===
After spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography | work=The New York Times | title=Gus van Sant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a job as a production assistant to filmmaker [[Ken Shapiro]], with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made ''Alice in Hollywood'', a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.'s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society's fringes, making his feature film [[directorial debut]] ''[[Mala Noche]]''.

It was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer [[Walt Curtis]]' semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director's hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been openly gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.

Shot in black-and-white, the film earned Van Sant almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the ''Los Angeles Times'' naming it the year's best [[independent film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gus-van-sant-411096 |title=Gus Van Sant : Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would later become ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' and ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'') that the studio declined to take interest in.

Van Sant moved back to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. He directed ''Drugstore Cowboy'' about four drug addicts robbing pharmacies to support their habit. The film met with great critical success and revived the career of [[Matt Dillon]].

===1990–1995: Indie and arthouse success===
''Drugstore Cowboy'''s exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991). Only with the success of ''Cowboy'' was Van Sant now given license to make ''Idaho'' (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now [[New Line Cinema]] had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the ''Idaho'' script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]] among others. In addition, it helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the ''[[Bill and Ted]]'' movies—to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him.

Van Sant's next film, a 1993 [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5&amp;nbsp;million and a large, eclectic cast including [[Uma Thurman]], [[John Hurt]], Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.

Van Sant's 1995 film ''[[To Die For]]'' helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of [[Joyce Maynard]]'s novel, the [[black comedy]] starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars [[Matt Dillon]] as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, [[Joaquin Phoenix]], as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for [[Larry Clark]]'s ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]''; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's ''Drugstore Cowboy''.

===1997–2003: Mainstream breakout===
In 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream recognition and critical acclaim thanks to ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', which starred and was written by [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]]. The film—about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius—was a huge critical and commercial success. It was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, including Best Director for Van Sant. It also won two, including Best Screenplay for Damon and Affleck, and Best Supporting Actor Oscar for [[Robin Williams]], who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as "the mellowest man in Hollywood." Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film's success in [[Kevin Smith]]'s'' [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.

The success of ''Good Will Hunting'' afforded Van Sant the opportunity to [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. It starred [[Anne Heche]], [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Julianne Moore]], and met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office.

In 2000, Van Sant directed ''[[Finding Forrester]]'', about a high-school student ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) from [[the Bronx]] unlikely becoming a friend of a crusty, reclusive author ([[Sean Connery]]). Critical response was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/finding_forrester/|title=Finding Forrester|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to directing, he devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, ''[[Pink (novel)|Pink]]'', which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix's death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===2003–present: Return to arthouse cinema===

Van Sant traveled to the deserts of [[Argentina]], [[Utah]], and [[Death Valley]] for the production of 2002's ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and [[Casey Affleck]]—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

It took ''Gerry'' over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]''. Approached by [[HBO]] and producer [[Diane Keaton]] to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. As well as melding improvisational long takes like those in ''Gerry'' with [[Harris Savides]]' fluid camerawork, the film was also influenced by Alan Clarke's 1989 film of the same name (see ''[[Elephant (1989 film)|Elephant]]''). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]. At the [[Cannes]] festival, the jury awarded ''Elephant'' with their top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]], and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com" /&gt; The success of ''Elephant'' led Van Sant to show the U.S. premiere of ''Elephant'' as a fundraiser for [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]], an organization working to help youth living on the streets of [[Portland, Oregon]].

{{Anchor|Death Trilogy}}In 2005, Van Sant released ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', the final component of what he refers to as his "Death Trilogy," (the other parts being ''Gerry'' and ''Elephant''). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' based on the book by [[Blake Nelson]], about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone's death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the "Le Marais" segment of the omnibus film ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''.

Released in 2008, Van Sant's ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' is a biopic of [[openly gay]] San Francisco politician [[Harvey Milk]], who was assassinated in 1978 and is played by [[Sean Penn]] in the movie. The film received eight [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Penn and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for writer [[Dustin Lance Black]].

Following ''Promised Land'', Van Sant directed a film titled ''[[Sea of Trees (film)|Sea of Trees]]'', which starred [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Ken Watanabe]].

[[File:Hans-Joachim Bohlmann.jpg|thumb|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann in 2000.]]
'''Hans-Joachim Bohlmann''' (20 September 1937  –  19 January 2009) was a German serial [[Vandalism of art|vandal]] who primarily targeted artworks at public exhibitions. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138 million euro) by such artists as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave] Spiegel, 1 October 2005 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bohlmann was born in [[Breslau]] (modern Wrocław).

Since his youth, Bohlmann suffered from a serious [[personality disorder]]. At the age of 16, he voluntarily went to the psychiatric clinic of the [[University of Kiel]] and underwent [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electric shock]] and [[insulin]] treatments. Around that time, he was a plumber apprentice, but could not focus on a single occupation and was doing various jobs. He had several therapy courses involving [[Sedative|tranquilizers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]] drugs, [[behavior therapy]] and [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]], but with very limited success.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In 1968, Bohlmann married and worked for six years at a warehouse. He then frequently took [[valium]] and [[haloperidol]] and regularly attended church masses. In 1974, he met the neurosurgeon Dieter Müller from the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]] who suggested a [[lobotomy]] treatment. Although Müller predicted a 75–80% chance of success, the operation brought no improvement. It was later criticized as obsolete and merely reduced Bohlmann's intelligence. On 11 March 1977, his wife fell from a window while cleaning and died from injuries soon after. According to Bohlmann, the death of his wife turned him to vandalism. Previously, he often visited museums with his wife and saw the importance of art in society. He then started to buy [[sulfuric acid]] at pharmacies and spray it on paintings.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

His vandalism began on 16 March 1977 in a city park and followed on 29 March 1977 in [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]], where he damaged the painting ''Golden Fish'' by [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/goldfish.jpg.html Klee: The Goldfish]. Artchive.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by other attacks in [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Essen]], [[Dortmund]], [[Hannover]], [[Bochum]], [[Kassel]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Hamelin]]. On 16 August 1977, he poured sulfuric acid on several artworks including portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the [[Lower Saxony State Museum]] of Hanover. On 24 August 1977, he damaged the painting ''Archduke Albrecht'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/sir-peter-paul-rubens-and-studio-siegen-1577-16-1-c-vcdsddiqxk Lot 89: Sir Peter Paul Rubens and Studio Siegen 1577 – 1640 Antwerp]. Invaluable.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; in Düsseldorf and on 7 October 1977 four paintings in [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in Kassel, estimated at more than 25 million euros, among them Rembrandt's [[:File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 062.jpg|''Jacob blessing Joseph's second son, 1656'']], a self-portrait by Rembrandt and [[Willem Drost]]'s ''Noli me tangere''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 30 Jahre nach Säureattentat: Willem Drosts "Noli me tangere" erstrahlt in neuem Glanz (30 years after acid attack: Willem Drosts' "Noli me tangere" shines in new splendor)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064922/http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php?parent=2244 |date=19 July 2011 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In his attacks, Bohlmann was primarily targeting the faces of the personages, trying to inflict maximum damage. Bohlmann's activity was not restricted to paintings and museums; he ignited an altar in Lübeck and sprayed hundreds of tombstones with swastikas at night in Hamburg. The resultant outrage in the press encouraged him. As he felt he was becoming a celebrity, he abandoned the antidepressant drugs he had been taking.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

Bohlmann was arrested in October 1977 and in 1979 convicted by the Hamburg Regional Court to five years in prison for 17 cases of damage to public property, 3 cases of damage to private property and one case of cruelty to animals. He served the term in full until 6 October 1982.&lt;ref name=sp1&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,147904,00.html "Dürer-Attentäter" auf der Flucht] Spiegel, 31 July 2001 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; After release from prison, Bohlmann resumed vandalism. He was then banned from buying acid and instead committed arson at a construction site near Hamburg inflicting damage estimated at 65,000 euros. For this crime, the Hamburg Regional Court sentenced him to three years ending on 5 May 1986. A part of his pension was seized for the damage done to Ruben's ''Archduke Albrecht'', and in the autumn of 1987 he went for treatment in the psychiatric department of the Hospital Hamburg-[[Eilbek]].&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;

In March 1988, Bohlmann bought two litres of sulfuric acid and hid them in a park. On 20 April 1988, he took a leave from the hospital and the next day splashed acid on three paintings by Albrecht Dürer in Munich's [[Alte Pinakothek]], namely [[Lamentation of Christ (Dürer, Munich)|''Lamentation for Christ'']], [[Paumgartner altarpiece|''Paumgartner Altar'']] and [[:File:Albrecht Dürer 025.jpg|''Mater Dolarosa'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xKyeh1_V7IC&amp;pg=PA283|page=283|title=Albrecht Dürer: a guide to research|author=Jane Campbell Hutchison|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0-8153-2114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicting damage estimated at 35 million euros. Immediately after the attacks, he was arrested and held in the psychiatric hospital of [[Haar, Bavaria]]. In 1989 he was convicted by the Munich District Court to a two-year imprisonment, concurrent with treatment as long as necessary in a psychiatric hospital, and in March 1990 transferred to the clinic in Hamburg-Ochsenzoll. Bohlmann escaped from the facility in January 1998 and after being at large for two days he was found at a subway station, possibly on the way back to the hospital. On 30 July 2001 he escaped again but returned to hospital the next morning.&lt;ref name=sp2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sp1/&gt;

In Ochsenzoll he attended art therapy and for nine years painted pictures, almost every day, with a total number of about 1,500. In January 2005, more than 16 years after his arrest in Munich, Bohlmann was released to public life. On 25 June 2006, in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, he splashed lighter fuel on the painting ''[[:File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster]]'' (1648) by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]] and set fire to it. Most damage was to the varnish layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en Van der Helst painting vandalised in Rijksmuseum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311023730/http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nieuwsenagenda/vanderhelst?lang=en |date=11 March 2007 }} News item [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]], retrieved 30-aug-09&lt;/ref&gt; Bohlmann was sentenced to 3 years by the court in Amsterdam. After serving two-thirds of the sentence, on 24 June 2008 he was released from prison, returned to Hamburg and died there on 19 January 2009 of cancer.

The '''Havana Biennial Art Exhibition''' takes place in [[Havana]] ([[Cuba]]) every two years. It principally aims at promoting the developing world in''' '''[[contemporary art]] circles, giving priority to Latin American and Caribbean artists, although artists from all over the world submit works.

Since its first edition in 1984, the Biennial event has had central themes, among them tradition and contemporary times, challenges, art, society and reflection, man and memory, life with art and urban life. Works emphasize mainly paintings and other two-dimensional displays, using a variety of techniques.

==History==
The event was established in 1984. This edition exhibited artists only from [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 11th Havana Biennial Attracts Americans|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/arts/design/11th-havana-biennial-attract-americans.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-05-18|access-date = 2015-04-22|issn = 0362-4331|first = Victoria|last = Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 event included art from [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] and became the most important meeting place for artists from "non-Western" countries.

Lapses in the schedule were due to funding challenges. The 8th Biennial of 2002 was delayed an entire year, resuming in November 2003. This event showcased art within the social landscape, outside of traditional institutions. Artists normally unable or unwilling to participate with large institutions engaged diverse audiences by bringing art out of the museum and into the streets. Noteworthy artists to have "activated" the urban space include Mitchell Sipus and [[Fabiana de Barros]].

The first two Biennial events included an awards ceremony, but the organizing committee then made it a non-competitive event.

===10th Havana Biennial===
With a central theme called "''Integration and resistance in the Globalization Era''", the 10th Havana Biennial Art Exhibition took place from March 27 to April 30, 2009. Experts from the Wifredo Lam Contemporary Art Center reviewed more than 400 proposals submitted by artists from 44 nations. For the first time, the organisers decided to include western countries.

The 10th edition added conferences, workshops, master classes, documentaries and video screenings. The artists transformed the city into a showcase of [[contemporary art]], taking over all available urban spaces and municipal galleries.

Common topics included the tensions between tradition and contemporary reality, challenges to the historical processes of colonization, the relationships between art and society, individuals and memory, the effects of technological development on human communication and the dynamics of urban culture.

The curators for this 2009 Biennial were Margarita González, Nelson Herrera Ysla, José Manuel Noceda, Ibis Hernández Abascal, Margarita Sánchez Prieto, José Fernández Portal and Dannys Montes de Oca Moreda.

The [[literature|literary]] concept of the '''heteronym''' refers to one or more imaginary character(s) created by a writer to write in different styles. Heteronyms differ from [[pen names]] (or [[pseudonym]]s, from the Greek words for "false" and "name") in that the latter are just false names, while the former are characters that have their own supposed physiques, biographies, and writing styles.&lt;ref&gt;ZENITH, Richard (2002), ''The Book of Disquiet'', Penguin Classics, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heteronyms were named and developed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] writer and poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] in the early 20th Century, but they were thoroughly explored by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century and have also been used by other writers.

==Pessoa's heteronyms==
In Pessoa's case, there are at least 70 heteronyms (according to the latest count by Pessoa's editor Teresa Rita Lopes). Some of them are relatives or know each other; they criticise and translate each other's works. Pessoa's three chief heteronyms are Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis and [[Álvaro de Campos]]; the latter two consider the former their master. There are also two whom Pessoa called ''semi-heteronyms'', [[Bernardo Soares]] and the Baron of Teive, who are semi-autobiographical characters who write in prose, "a mere mutilation" of the Pessoa personality. There is, lastly, an ''orthonym'', [[Fernando Pessoa]], the namesake of the author, who also considers Caeiro his master.

The heteronyms dialogue with each other and even with Pessoa in what he calls "the theatre of being" or "drama in people". They sometimes intervened in Pessoa's social life: during Pessoa's only attested romance, a jealous Campos wrote letters to the girl, who enjoyed the game and wrote back.

Pessoa, also an amateur astrologer, created in 1915 the heteronym Raphael Baldaya, a long bearded astrologer. He elaborated horoscopes of his main heteronyms in order to determine their personalities.

'''Fernando Pessoa on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as "me myself" instead of "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: Fernando Pessoa, Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13.01.1935, in ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin Classics, 2002, p. 474.

'''George Steiner on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pseudonymous writing is not rare in literature or philosophy (Kierkegaard provides a celebrated instance). 'Heteronyms', as Pessoa called and defined them, are something different and exceedingly strange. For each of his 'voices', Pessoa conceived a highly distinctive poetic idiom and technique, a complex biography, a context of literary influence and polemics and, most arrestingly of all, subtle interrelations and reciprocities of awareness. Octavio Paz defines Caeiro as 'everything that Pessoa is not and more'.

He is a man magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, almost a Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with classical myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, the sense of being an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: George Steiner, "A man of many parts", in ''The Observer'', Sunday, 3 June 2001.

'''Richard Zenith on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Álvaro de Campos, the poet-persona who grew old with Pessoa and held a privileged place in his inventor’s hearts. Soares, the assistant bookkeeper and Campos, the naval engineer never met in the pen-and-paper drama of Pessoa’s heteronyms, who were frequently pitted against one other, but the two writer-characters were spiritual brothers, even if their worldly occupations were at odds. Campos wrote prose, as well as poetry, and much of it reads at it came, so to speak, from the hand of Soares. Pessoa was often unsure who was writing when he wrote, and it’s curious that the very first item among the more than 25,000 pieces that make up his archives in the National Library of Lisbon bears the heading  ''A. de C. (?) or B. de D.  (or something else).''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: Richard Zenith, introduction to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Penguin Classics, 2002, p. XI.

==Álvaro de Campos==
This heteronym was created by [[Fernando Pessoa]] as an ''[[alter ego]]'' who inherited his role from '''Alexander Search''' and this one from '''Charles Robert Anon'''. The latter was created when Pessoa lived in [[Durban]], while Search was created in 1906, when Pessoa was a student at Lisbon's University, in search of his Portuguese cultural identity, after his return from [[Durban]]. 

Anon was supposedly English, while Search, although English, was born in Lisbon. After the Portuguese republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa dropped his English heteronyms and '''Álvaro de Campos''' was created as a Portuguese ''[[alter ego]]''. Álvaro de Campos, born in 1890, was supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer graduated in [[Glasgow]]. 

Campos sailed to the Orient, living experiences that he describes in his poem "Opiarium". He worked in London (1915), Barrow on Furness and Newcastle (1922), but became unemployed, and returned to Lisbon in 1926, the year of the military putsh that installed dictatorship. He also wrote "Lisbon Revisited (1923)" and "Lisbon Revisited (1926)".

Campos was a [[decadentism|decadent]] poet, but he embraced [[Futurism]]; his poetry was strongly influenced by [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Marinetti]]. He wrote the "Ode Triumphal" and "Ode Maritime", published in the literary journal ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'', in 1915, and other unfinished. 

while unemployed in Lisbon, he became depressed, returning to [[Decadentism]] and [[Pessimism]]. 
Then he wrote his master work, "Tobacco Shop", published in 1933, in the literary journal ''[[Presença]]''.

==Alberto Caeiro==
Pessoa created this heteronym as "Master" of the other heteronyms and even Pessoa himself. 
This fictional character was born in 1889 and died in 1915, at 26, the same age of Pessoa's best friend [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]], who killed himself in Paris, in 1916. Thus, Sá-Carneiro seems to have inspired, at least partially, Alberto Caeiro.
 
Caeiro was a humble man of poor education, but a great poet "naif", he was born in Lisbon, but lives almost his life in the countryside, Ribatejo, near Lisbon, where he died. However, his poetry is full of philosophy. He wrote "Poemas Inconjuntos" (Disconnected Poems) and "O Guardador de Rebanhos" (The Keeper of Sheep), published by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in his "Art Journal" ''Athena'' in 1924-25.

In a famous letter to the literary critic Adolfo Casais Monteiro, dated January 13, 1935, Pessoa describes his "triumphal day", Mach 8, 1914, when Caeiro "appeared", making him write down all the poetry of "The Keeper of Sheep" at once. Caeiro influenced the Neopaganism of Pessoa, and of the heteronyms António Mora and Ricardo Reis. Poetically, he influenced mainly the Neoclassicism of Reis, which is connected to Paganism.

==Ricardo Reis==

[[Image:Carta astral ricardo reis.jpg|thumb|300px|Astrological chart of the heteronym ''Ricardo Reis'' by Fernando Pessoa.]]

This heteronym was created by [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] as a Portuguese doctor born in [[Oporto]], in September 19, 1887. Reis supposedly studied at a boarding school run by [[Jesuit]]s in which he received a classical education. He was an amateur [[latinist]] and poet; politically a monarchist, he went into exile to Brazil after the defeat of a monarchical rebellion against the [[Portuguese Republic]] in 1919. Ricardo Reis reveals his [[Epicureanism]] and [[Stoicism]] in the "Odes by Ricardo Reis", published by [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] in 1924, in his literary journal ''Athena''.

Since [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] didn't determine the death of Reis, one can assume that he survived his author who died in 1935. In ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (1984), Portuguese [[nobel prize]] [[José Saramago]] rebuilds, in his own personal outlook, the literary world of this heteronym after 1935, creating a dialog between Ricardo Reis and the ghost of his author.

== List of Pessoa's heteronyms ==

{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="100%"

! No. !! Name !! Type !! *Notes
|-
| 1 || Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa || himself || Commercial correspondent in Lisbon
|-
| 2 || Fernando Pessoa || orthonym || Poet and prose writer
|-
| 3 || Fernando Pessoa || autonym || Poet and prose writer
|-
| 4 || Fernando Pessoa || heteronym || Poet, a pupil of Alberto Caeiro
|-
| 5 || Alberto Caeiro || heteronym || Poet, author of 'O guardador de Rebanhos','O Pastor Amoroso' and 'Poemas inconjuntos', master of Fernando Pessoa heteronyms, Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, António Mora and Coelho Pacheco
|-
| 6 || Ricardo Reis || heteronym || Poet and prose writer, author of 'Odes' and texts on the work of Alberto Caeiro. ''Biographical note'': (Oporto, 1887–1936). He graduated in medicine  and is an unconditional admirer of the Greek civilisation above all others, and considers himself to be an expatriate from Greece. Being a royalist he chooses to emigrate to Brazil in 1919 (Portuguese monarchy had been overthrown in 1910). In his neoclassical odes he ponders on the briefness of life, the inevitability of death and the helplessness of  the human condition. This “sad epicure” tries to find some contentment through the acceptance of fate and self-discipline lives by Horatio’s a motto: carpe diem (seize the day).  
|-
| 7 || Frederico  Reis || heteronym/para-heteronym || Essayist, brother of Ricardo Reis, upon whom he writes
|-
| 8 || Álvaro de Campos || heteronym || Poet and prose writer, a pupil of Alberto Caeiro. ''Biographical note'': Álvaro de Campos. (Tavira, Algarve, 1890 - ?). He studies naval engineering in Scotland. He feels a foreigner wherever he is. Suffocated by a tedious and monotonous existence, failing to see the meaning of life, he looks for new sensations and travels to the Far East. When he comes back he is a renewed man. He embraces the futuristic movement and worships industrialisation and scientific and technological progress, with its hectic relentless rhythm and continuous change. There is an ecstasy of the senses, his relationship with machines and charcoal and steel is almost erotic. But in the background of this modern world lurk the shadows of the assembly line, the pollution, the emptiness of material things. The darkness of what is to come —eventually Campos tires. In his third phase, profoundly disenchanted with the present, he evokes the long-gone days of his perfectly happy childhood.

{{Wiktionary}}

'''Identification''' is a term used in [[Literary criticism|literary]] and [[Film theory|film]] studies to describe a psychological relationship between the reader of a novel and a character in the book, or between a spectator in the audience and a character on screen. In both cases, readers and spectators see themselves in the fictional character.

Identification is usually supposed to be largely unconscious: a reader may be aware that she likes a given character, but not that she actually sees that character as an alter ego, a version of her, or a projection of her aspirations for herself.  It would be a mistake to think all heroes foster identification, or that all villains inhibit identification—many, perhaps even most, characters elicit some degree of identification on the part of the reader or spectator. In film, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] exploited the traits of casual identification with specific moments, even when the character was villainous. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), Hitchcock explained that as the character Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) was disposing of the car containing Marion Crane's body in a swamp, for a brief moment he had the car stop sinking. "When Perkins is looking at the car sinking in the pond... the public are thinking, 'I hope it goes all the way down!' It's a natural instinct."&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois (1978) ''Hitchcock'' (Revised Edition) Paladin, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iran Azeri Cartoon.png|thumb|300px|right|Cartoon that started the controversy. The boy tries to address the cockroach using different forms of ''soosk'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] word for cockroach) and in one of the cartoons it answers ''Namana?'' ([[Azerbaijani language]] for ''What?'')]]
[[Image:Azeri Cartoon Persian speaking cockroach .jpg|thumb|200px|right|The cockroach also spoke in [[Persian language|Persian]].]]

The '''Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy''' occurred in response to a [[cartoon]] drawn by the cartoonist [[Mana Neyestani]] and published in the [[Iran]]ian holiday-magazine ''Iran-e-jomee'' on 12 May 2006.

The cartoon describes nine methods of dealing with cockroaches by depicting a Persian-speaking child and a cockroach. During the first method, when the cockroach does not understand him, the child decides to talk to the cockroach in "cockroach language" using different forms of ''soosk'' (Persian word for cockroach). But the cockroach does not even understand its "own" language and replies by saying "''Namana?''" ("''What?''"). As ''namana'' is a word which originates in the [[Azerbaijani language]], the cartoon has been interpreted by some as an insult to [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]].

==Contents of the article==
The article which the cartoons accompany is entitled "How to stop the cockroaches from making us into cockroaches?" It is a satirical article in a children's weekly newspaper. The cartoon depicts nine methods of dealing with cockroaches including dialogue, oppression, elimination, population control, and violence. The text of the paragraph in the first image describes the first method, translated as follows:
{{cquote|"First method: dialogue"&lt;br /&gt;
Some people believe that one should not resort to violence as an initial step, because that will just take all the fun out of the process. So we must first try to come to the table like civilized people and have a dialogue with the cockroaches. But the problem is that a cockroach cannot understand human language [i.e., reasoned argument]. And cockroach grammar is so difficult—nobody has yet discovered which of their verbs end in "ing"--that 80% of the cockroaches themselves do not know it and prefer to speak in other languages. When even the cockroaches do not understand their own language, how could you possibly understand it?! This is precisely why negotiations hit a dead-end and the sweet methodology of violence becomes a necessity!}}

The child proceeds to speak in "cockroach language" to the cockroach, but the cockroach doesn't understand him and replies "''Namana?''" ("''What?''"). ''Namana'' is originally an [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani-Turkic word]], but is also sometimes used in Persian as a slang. In other sections of the article where the violence option is entertained, the cockroach speaks in Persian to the child. 

The article's use of the key words "''dialogue''" (گفتمان) and "''violence''" (خشونت ورزی), plus discussions about problems understanding the language of the "cockroaches," can be interpreted as tacit references to the reformist's nomenclature in contrast to the language of the conservatives in Iran. The famous reformist motto "[[Mohammad Khatami#Dialogue Among Civilizations|dialogue between civilizations]]", used by Iran's former president [[Mohammad Khatami]], was a source of criticism among the intelligentsia, because they questioned how it could be possible to have such a dialogue between Iran and the western civilizations when it was not even possible to have a dialogue and mutual understanding between reformist and conservative Iranians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Aftermath==
The publication of the cartoon caused controversy among [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]] for allegedly comparing them to cockroaches. It was deemed by some people as part of a long-standing chauvinistic attitude towards Iranian Azerbaijanis among parts of the Persian-speaking majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/12/iran-a-minority-report/305367/|title=Iran: A Minority Report|last=Wood|first=Graeme|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/iranian-azeris-a-giant-minority|title=Iranian Azeris: A Giant Minority|author=Ali M. Koknar|date=June 6, 2006|website=www.washingtoninstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy resulted in massive protests in May 2006 throughout the predominantly [[Iranian Azeris|Azerbaijani-populated]] cities of [[Tabriz]], [[Urmia]], [[Ardabil]], [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]] and [[Naqadeh|Naghadeh (Sulduz)]] and a number of smaller towns. After violent reactions from the Iranian police, the initially peaceful protests turned violent in most cases, with protesters throwing stones and damaging government related properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7296 Iran's Azeri minority protests mocking cartoon] Iran Focus {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519051754/http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7296|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] claims that "hundreds, if not thousands, were arrested and tens of Azerbaijani-Turks reportedly shot and killed by the security forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2007&amp;c=IRN Amnesty International.

The [[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] promptly responded to the events by temporarily shutting down the ''Iran'' newspaper, arresting the cartoonist Mana Neyestani, who is himself an ethnic Azeri Türk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5024550.stm|title=Iran Azeris protest over cartoon|date=2006-05-28|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Mehrdad Ghasemfar. It further accused outside forces of "playing the nationalistic card".&lt;ref&gt;Daria Vaisman.

==Possible foreign interference==

[[Emad Afrough]], head of the Majlis Cultural Commission at the time, said that [[pan-Turkism|pan-Turkists]] were involved in creating the tensions.&lt;ref name="Iran-Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2571/html/national.htm#s147618|title=Student Demo In Tehran University|publisher=Iran-daily|date=May 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012203158/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2571/html/national.htm#s147618|archivedate=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Iranian government blamed it on the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]], suspecting the incitement of ethnic strife in Iran. It was alleged that the United States  is conducting covert operations in Iran and is allied with Iran's neighbor, the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HF08Ak02.html|publisher=Asia Times Online|date=Jun 8, 2006|title=Foreign plots and cockroaches in Iran|author=Iason Athanasiadis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas Maleki, a senior research fellow at [[Harvard University]] and former deputy foreign minister of Iran, stated:&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think that when [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] says all options are on the table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr [[Mahmudali Chehregani]], one of the pan-Turkist leaders agitating for a separatist [[Azeri]] agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former [[CIA]] operative, had stated in the early 1990s:&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Accessible through [[Turkey]] and ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, eyed already by nationalists in [[Baku]], more westward-looking than most [of] Iran, and economically going nowhere, Iran's richest agricultural province was an ideal CIA [covert action] theater.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Touraj Atabaki]], well-known expert on [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]], there might be some truth behind the Iranian government's allegations of a foreign plot, yet the responsibility for the unrest lies first and foremost with the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16060 |title=Iran: Cartoon protests signal Azeri frustration|author=Jean-Christophe Peuch|date=January 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827231413/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16060|archivedate=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writer Iason Athanasiadis opines that "there is no hard evidence pointing toward the troubles as being anything but domestic".&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

'''Judy Chicago''' (born '''Judith Sylvia Cohen'''; July 20, 1939) is an American [[feminist art]]ist, art educator,&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014). ''Institutional Time.'' The Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and writer known for her large collaborative [[art installation]] pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first [[feminist art]] program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as [[needlework]], counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as [[welding]] and [[pyrotechnics]]. Chicago's most well known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', which is permanently installed in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. ''The Dinner Party'' celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork.

==Early personal life==

Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia Cohen&lt;ref name="A305"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 305&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of [[rabbi]]s, including the [[Vilna Gaon]]. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a [[labor organization|labor organizer]] and a [[Marxist]].&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a [[medical secretary]].&lt;ref name="A305"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; Arthur's active participation in the [[American Communist Party]], liberal views towards women and support of worker's rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.&lt;ref name="A306"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an [[FBI]] agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; Arthur's health declined, and he died in 1953 from [[peritonitis]]. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved [[grief]].&lt;ref name="F279"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

May loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a [[pottery|potter]]. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to attend classes.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W5"&gt;Wydler and Lippard, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she "never wanted to do anything but make art"&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;  She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute,&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; and instead attended [[UCLA]] on a scholarship.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

==Education and early career==

While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA [[NAACP]]  chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary.&lt;ref name="A306"/&gt; In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple [[hitch hike]]d to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.&lt;ref name="A308"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in [[Greenwich Village]] for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.&lt;ref name="A311"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1962 and was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an [[identity crisis]] until later that decade. She received her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from UCLA in 1964.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt;

While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was [[abstract art|abstract]], yet easily recognized as male and female [[sexual organs]]. These early works were called ''Bigamy,'' and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract [[human penis|penis]], which was "stopped in flight" before it could unite with a [[vagina|vaginal form]]. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works.&lt;ref name="A311"/&gt; Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.

In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chicago|first=Judy|title=Illustrated Career History|url=http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227074456/http://www.judychicago.com/about/career-history.php|archivedate=2014-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the "California Women in the Arts" exhibition at the [[Lytton Center]], to which she answered, "I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels." Chicago began working in [[ice sculpture]], which represented "a metaphor for the preciousness of life," another reference towards her husband's death.&lt;ref name="A314"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pasadenalifesaversstudy.jpg|thumb|right|''Study for Pasadena Lifesavers,'' prismacolor, 1968.]]

In 1969, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an "experimental" gallery. ''[[Art in America]]'' noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the [[conceptual art]] movement, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the work as showing no signs of "theoretical New York type art."&lt;ref name="A314"/&gt; Chicago would describe her early artwork as [[minimalist]] and as her trying to be "one of the boys".&lt;ref name="L455"&gt;Lewis and Lewis, 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago would also experiment with [[performance art]], using [[fireworks]] and [[pyrotechnics]] to create "atmospheres", which involved flashes of coloured smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to "feminize" and "soften" the landscape.&lt;ref name="A315"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' which was a series of abstract paintings that placed [[acrylic paint]] on [[Plexiglas]]. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes "turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle," representing her own discovery that "I was [[orgasm|multi-orgasmic]]." Chicago credited ''Pasadena Lifesavers,'' as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt;

===From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change===

As Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided she wanted to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage.&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; During this time, she married sculptor [[Lloyd Hamrol]], in 1965. (They divorced in 1979.)&lt;ref name="F280"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery owner [[Rolf Nelson]] nicknamed her "Judy Chicago"&lt;ref name="F279"/&gt; because of her strong personality and thick [[Chicago accent]]. She decided this would be her new name, and sought to change it legally. She changed her last name from an ethnically charged, Gerowitz, to an ethnically neutral Chicago. In doing so, she freed herself from a certain social identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Identity in Modern Art History|last=Soussloff|first=Catherine|publisher=U of California Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was described as being "appalled" by the fact that she had to have her new husband's signature on the paperwork to change her name legally.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a [[boxer]], wearing a [[sweatshirt]] with her new last name on it.&lt;ref name="A315"/&gt; She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], that read: "Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago."&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in ''[[Artforum]]'s'' October 1970 issue.&lt;ref name=Levin2007p139&gt;[[#SrcLevin2007|Levin, ''Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist'', p. 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

===The feminist art movement and the 1970s===
In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at [[Fresno State College]], hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.&lt;ref name="A317"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317&lt;/ref&gt; At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape "the presence and hence, the expectations of men."&lt;ref name="A318"&gt;Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318&lt;/ref&gt; She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851420315|title=Institutional time : a critique of studio art education|last=1939-|first=Chicago, Judy,|isbn=9781580933667|oclc=851420315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Chicago is considered one of the "first-generation feminist artists," a group that also includes [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], and [[Rachel Rosenthal]]. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in Europe and the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|United States]] in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Thomas Patin and Jennifer McLerran | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago became a teacher at the [[California Institute for the Arts]], and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created [[Womanhouse]], alongside [[Miriam Schapiro]], which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; With [[Arlene Raven]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]], Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Woman's Building records, 1970-1992 | work=[[Archives of American Art]] | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/womans-building-records-6347/more#biohist | accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Judy_Chicago#biography|title=Judy Chicago|website=SFMOMA|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as "an experimental program in female education in the arts.  Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women."&lt;ref name="L455"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Looking For Lyotard, Beyond the Genre of Feminist Manifesto|journal=Trespassing|date=2013|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://trespassingjournal.com/Issue2/TPJ_I2_Moravec_Article.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with [[geometric]] forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the "feminine". Chicago was strongly influenced by [[Gerda Lerner]], whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of [[women's history]] would continue to struggle independently and collectively.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;

===Womanhouse===
{{main|Womanhouse}}
Womanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]]. It began in the fall of 1971. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art-making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. 
"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women."&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schapiro|first1=Miriam|last2=Chicago|first2=Judy|title=Womanhouse catalog essay|url=http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|publisher=Womanhouse|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611044304/http://www.suzyspence.com/womanhouse/Womanhousecatalogessay.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Womanhouse is a "true" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1975, Chicago's first book, ''Through the Flower'', was published; it "chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist."&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

===''The Dinner Party''===
[[File:Judy Chicago The Dinner Party.JPG|thumb|right|''[[The Dinner Party]]'' as installed at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
{{Main|The Dinner Party}}

Chicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about ''their'' history. This action would become Chicago's [[masterpiece]], ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', now in the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="BM1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=The Dinner Party | work=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art | publisher=Brooklyn Museum | url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/index.php | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took her five years and cost about $250,000 to complete.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; First, Chicago conceived the project in her [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] studio: a large triangle, which measures 48-feet by 43-feet by 36-feet, consisting of 39 [[place setting]]s.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Each place setting commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists and martyrs. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in [[needlework]], creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.&lt;ref name="F281"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Dinner Party'' was first constructed it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non-profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and ''The Dinner Party'', entitled "The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970-2007".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.throughtheflower.org|title=Through the Flower and Judy Chicago|website=www.throughtheflower.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many art critics including Hilton Kramer from The New York Times, who were unimpressed by her work.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/insider/judy-chicago-dinner-part-art-reviews-times.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Kramer felt Judy's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and "it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Although art critics, felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just "vaginas on plates", it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago was able to debut her work in 6 countries on 3 different continents. She was able to reach over a million people through her artwork. Her piece of work may not have agreed with critics but was able to captivate the public with her feminist message and honor the 39 historical figures and 999 other women featured in her work.

===''Birth Project'' and ''PowerPlay''===

From 1980 until 1985, Chicago created ''Birth Project''. It took five years to create. The piece used images of [[childbirth]] to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/style/judy-chicago-women-s-lives-and-art.html|title=JUDY CHICAGO: WOMEN'S LIVES AND ART|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=1985-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation reinterpreted the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which focused on the idea that a male [[god]] created a male human, [[Adam]], without the involvement of a woman.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; Chicago described the piece as revealing a "primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation."&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; 150 needleworkers from the United States, [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by [[quilting]], [[macrame]], [[embroidery]] and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from ''Birth Project'' are held in the collection of the [[Albuquerque Museum]].&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt;

Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, "There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had."&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Rachel|title=The art of Judy Chicago|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Birth Project'', Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created ''PowerPlay,'' a series of drawings, [[weaving]]s, paintings, [[cast paper]] and bronze [[reliefs]]. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male [[gaze]] with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jchicago.html | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new kind of collaboration and ''The Holocaust Project''===

In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests "shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Judy Chicago in the UK | author=Galit Mana | journal=[[Jewish Renaissance]] |date=October 2012 | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' (1985–93)&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; is a collaboration with her husband, photographer [[Donald Woodman]], whom she married on [[New Year's Eve]] 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both [[Jewish]], it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.  Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an [[epic poem]] about the [[Holocaust]]. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish.&lt;ref name="F281"/&gt; The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], and the death of her mother from [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="F282"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at  [[Nazi concentration camps]] and other relevant Holocaust sites.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="W6"/&gt; They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as [[environmentalism]], [[Native American genocide]],&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; and the [[Vietnam War]]. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.&lt;ref name="W5"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the [[sewing]] of [[Audrey Cowan]]. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; ''The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light'' was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the [[Spertus Museum]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Most of the work from the piece is held at the [[Holocaust Center (Pittsburgh)|Holocaust Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="F284"&gt;Felder and Rosen, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; Galit Mana of ''Jewish Renaissance'' magazine notes, "This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition", including ''Voices from the Song of Songs'' (1997), where Chicago "introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters."&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt;

===Current work and life===

In 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a "Renewal Ketubah" in 2010.&lt;ref name="Illustrated Career History" /&gt;

In 1994, Judy Chicago started "Resolutions: A Stitch in Time" which took 6 years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/judy-chicago-9246631|title=Judy Chicago|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic [[Belen Hotel]], an historic railroad hotel in [[Belen, New Mexico]] which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago's archives are held at the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Radcliffe College]], and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the [[University of New Mexico]]. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded [[honorary degree]]s from [[Lehigh University]], [[Smith College]], [[Duke University]]&lt;ref name="JWE"&gt;{{cite web | author=Debra Wacks | year=2012 | title=Judy Chicago | work= | publisher=Jewish Women's Archives | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/chicago-judy | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russell Sage College]].&lt;ref name="F284"/&gt; In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from [[Moore College of Art &amp; Design]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite web|title=Visionary Woman Awards|url=http://www.moore.edu/support_moore/visionary_woman_awards|work=Support Moore|publisher=Moore College of Art &amp; Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago was named a [[National Women's History Project]] honoree for [[Women's History Month]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="NWHP"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2008 | title=Judy Chicago | work=2008 Honorees | publisher=National Women's History Month Project | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/chicago_bio.php | accessdate=15 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Judy Chicago Art Education Collection {{!}} Penn State|url = http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/|website = judychicago.arted.psu.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="PSU"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Penn State Receives Judy Chicago Feminist Art Education Collections | work=Local News | publisher=Gant Daily | url=http://gantdaily.com/2011/06/12/penn-state-receives-judy-chicago-feminist-art-education-collections/ | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the "Concurrents" exhibition at the [[Getty Museum]]. For the exhibition, she returned to the [[Pomona College]] football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again.&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jori Finkel | year=2011 | title=Q&amp;A Judy Chicago | work=Censorship | publisher=Los Angeles Times | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/30/entertainment/la-ca-pst-judy-chicago-and-rebecca-mcgrew-2-20111030 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago had two solo exhibitions in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012, one in [[London]] and another in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about [[Virginia Woolf]]. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career.&lt;ref name="Jewish Renaissance"/&gt; That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair.&lt;ref name="Judy Chicago"/&gt;

Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: "I'm not career driven. [[Damien Hirst]]'s dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of ''The Dinner Party''. In the words of the artist: "I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina."&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;

Chicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, [[The British Museum]], [[The Brooklyn Museum]], The [[Getty Trust]], The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], [[New Mexico Museum of Art]], [[The National Gallery of Art]], [[The National Museum of Women in the Arts]], The [[Penn Academy of the Fine Arts]], and The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/judy-chicago|title=Judy Chicago {{!}} Artstor|website=www.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her interview with [[Gloria Steinem]], Chicago spoke of her "goal as an artist", stating that it "…has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze."&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Chicago" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of "Interview", pp. 28-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and work==
Chicago trained herself in "macho arts," taking classes in auto body work, [[boat building]], and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned [[spray painting]] techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create [[fireworks]] for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring [[fiberglass]] and [[metal]] into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under [[Mim Silinsky]] to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in ''The Dinner Party''. Chicago also added the skill of [[stained glass]] to her artistic tool belt, which she used for ''The Holocaust Project''.&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt; Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.&lt;ref name="W6"&gt;Wylder and Lippard, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2003, Chicago has been working with [[glass]].&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. ''The Dinner Party'', ''The Birth Project'' and ''The Holocaust Project'' were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to "stereotypical" women's arts such as [[textile arts]].&lt;ref name="F280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F282"/&gt; Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerhard|first1=Jane|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=0-8203-3675-0|pages=2, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through the Flower==

In 1978, Chicago founded [[Through the Flower]], a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of ''The Dinner Party,'' before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a "living curriculum" for education about feminist art ideas and [[pedagogy]]. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to [[Penn State University]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="PSU"/&gt;

==Teaching career==

Judy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn’t challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match -- both in her artwork and in her personal style --  what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed “masculine”, and attended motorcycle shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chicago|first=Judy|last2=Meyer|first2=Laura|date=1995-12-28|title=Judy Chicago, Feminist Artist and Educator|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j015v17n01_13|journal=Women &amp; Therapy|volume=17|issue=1-2|pages=125–140|doi=10.1300/j015v17n01_13|issn=0270-3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago’s teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keifer-Boyd|first=Karen|date=January 2007|title=From Content to Form: Judy Chicago's Pedagogy with Reflections by Judy Chicago|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=48|issue=2|pages=134–154|doi=10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096|issn=0039-3541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which "female-centered content," such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as "[[The personal is political|personal is political]]" content for art.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy, (n.d.). ''Art Practice/Art Pedagogy'', Judy Chicago Art Education Collection, Penn State, Box 11, Folder 6, page 1 at http://judychicago.arted.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Art-Practice-Art-PedagogyTranscript-and-Slide-Presentation-Boxx-11-6.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as "participatory art [[pedagogy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Keifer-Boyd, K. (2007). From content to form: Judy Chicago's pedagogy with reflections by Judy Chicago. Studies in Art Education: A Journal of Issues and Research in Art Education, 48(2), 133-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art created in the [[Feminist Art Program]] and [[Womanhouse]] introduced perspectives and content about women’s lives that had been taboo topics in society, including the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Jill (Ed.). (2012). ''Entering the picture: Judy Chicago, The Fresno Feminist Art Program, and the collective visions of women artists''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard, Jane F. (2013). ''The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the power of popular feminism. 1970-2007''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chicago developed the [[Feminist Art Program]] at California State University, Fresno, and has implemented other teaching projects that conclude with an art exhibition by students such as [[Womanhouse]] with [[Miriam Schapiro]] at CalArts, and ''SINsation'' in 1999 at Indiana University, ''From Theory to Practice: A Journey of Discovery'' at Duke University in 2000, ''At Home: A Kentucky Project with Judy Chicago and Donald Woodman'' at Western Kentucky University in 2002, ''Envisioning the Future'' at California Polytechnic State University and Pomona Arts Colony in 2004, and ''Evoke/Invoke/Provoke'' at Vanderbilt University in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago, Judy. (2014)  Institutional Time: A Critique of Studio Art Education. New York, NY: Monacelli Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Several students involved in Judy Chicago’s teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Faith Wilding]], and [[Nancy Youdelman]].

In the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts preparation, process, and art-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.

Starting in 1995, the KWA organised the annual Khmer Literature Festival.  It also staged competitions for novel and poetry writing, and gave out two awards:  the Preah Sihanouk Reach Award and the 7 January Award. The topic of the PSRA competition was national unification and peace, while the topic of the January competition was national development. Lacking funds, the festival and awards did not continue after 2000.&lt;ref name="culturalprofiles.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/units/182.html|title=Khmer Writers’ Association|date=24 July 2005|work=culturalprofiles.net|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2002, there were 192 members with approximately half being professional writers.&lt;ref name="JarvisAfranis2002" /&gt;

==Criticism==
A 1966 catalog of KWA works includes the Buddhism genres of [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|Pali]] and [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]].

This list includes both authors whose entire literary production was officially banned in [[Nazi Germany]] and authors who were only partially banned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://verbrannte-und-verbannte.de/person?person=all&amp;sort=name%3Aasc  ''Verbrannte und verbannte'']&lt;/ref&gt; These authors are from the prohibitions lists in Nazi Germany and come from the following lists and others:
# List of damaging and undesirable writing, ''Liste des schädlichen und unerwünschten Schrifttums'', December 31, 1938
# ''Jahreslisten 1939-1941''. Unchanged new printing of the Leipzig edition, 1938-1941, Vaduz 1979

The official list was published by the ''[[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda]]''. Authors, living and dead, were placed on the list because of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent, or because of [[pacifism|pacifist]] or [[communism|communist]] sympathies or suspicion thereof. 

In May and June 1933, in the first year of the Nazi government, there were [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]]s. These book bans compose a part of the history of [[censorship]] and a subset of the [[list of banned books]].

After [[World War II]] started, Germans created indexes of prohibited books in countries they occupied, of works in languages other than German. For example, in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], an index of 1,500 prohibited authors was created.&lt;ref&gt;Czesław Madajczyk, ''Polityka III Rzeszy w okupowanej Polsce, Tom II'' (Politics of the Third Reich in Occupied Poland, Part Two), Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1970, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2847">The '''Manchester Academy of Fine Arts''' ('''MAFA''') is a society established in 1859 to organise annual open exhibitions in [[Manchester City Art Gallery]], formerly the Manchester Institution. Since the refurbishment of the [[art gallery]], MAFA has endeavoured to maintain its profile by presenting [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] of [[painting]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[drawing]]s and [[sculpture]] in venues in [[Manchester]] and throughout [[North West England]].

The society has been associated with a number of notable individuals, including [[Alfred Waterhouse]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[LS Lowry]], [[Käthe Schuftan]], [[Norman Adams (British artist)|Norman Adams]] and Anne Redpath. Past presidents include the artists [[William Knight Keeling]], [[Charles Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Crozier (artist)|Robert Crozier]].&lt;ref name=MAFA&gt;[http://www.mafa.org.uk/past_presidents.php "History of Mafa: Past Presidents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302044715/http://www.mafa.org.uk/past_presidents.php |date=2016-03-02 }}, ''Manchester Academy of Fine Arts'' website, accessed 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Academy members have played a significant role in the Manchester art scene for over a century, including the design of several of its buildings and public works.

==Membership==

The academy consists of more than 100 elected members who are mainly professional artists practising not only in the North West of England but throughout the United Kingdom and in Europe. The objective of the academy is to promote the work of its members and other artists by organising exhibitions, workshops and talks.

In 2009–2010, MAFA celebrated its 150th anniversary through a series of exhibitions and a service at [[Manchester Cathedral]] in November 2009.

[[File:Perseo y Andrómeda, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|370px|''Perseus and Andromeda'' ]] 
'''''Perseus and Andromeda''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Titian]], now in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London. It was painted in 1554–56 as part of a series of mythological paintings called "''poesie''" ("poetry") intended for King [[Philip II of Spain]].  The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in this case Book IV, lines 663–752,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355-56&lt;/ref&gt; and all featured female nudes.

The painting is in oils on canvas, and measures 175 x 189.5 cm.  It was probably one already described as "damaged" in 1605, and has suffered subsequent damages, as well as apparently being cut down along all the sides. Scientific imaging techniques show an unusually large number of changes as the composition evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the hero [[Perseus]] flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him.  Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.&lt;ref name="I355"&gt;Ingamells, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is well-travelled; painted in [[Venice]], it was delivered in modern [[Belgium]], then went to Spain, Italy, England, and France before returning to England.

==Subject and sources==
[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Andromeda liberata da Perseo.jpg|thumb|''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], c. 1510, one of the few earlier easel paintings of the topic [[Uffizi]]]]
In Greek mythology, the kingdom of [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] was ruled by the beautiful but vain queen, [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiope]]; she maintained that her beauty, and that of her daughter Andromeda, was superior to that of the [[Nereids|sea nymphs]], who were the daughters of [[Poseidon]], the god of the sea. When the nymphs became aware of her claims, they protested to their father, who retaliated by calling up a [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] or sea monster to ravage the coastline of Ethiopia placing Cassiope's kingdom at risk. On the advice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Ammon, the Queen, together with her husband [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]], decided to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to the monster.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus, flying back from his killing of the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], kills the monster and rescues Andromeda, whom he then marries.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;

Titian follows Ovid fairly closely, although it is likely that his Latin was poor, and he mainly relied on somewhat simplified versions in Italian, of which there was a choice. This may explain some of the differences to the Latin original, although Titian may well just have interpreted the story freely.  In Ovid Andromeda's parents are nearby; here they are probably on the shore opposite, by a city. Andromeda stands amid seashells and [[coral]]. Coral is mentioned by Ovid, but as being formed from Medusa's locks at a later stage in the story.  Ovid describes Andromeda as looking like a statue, and having been crying; Titian's depiction matches both.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus had been given his curved sword by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and his shield by [[Minerva]].  Like Mercury, he wears winged boots, and also a winged helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Various visual sources have been suggested, both from the rather crude [[woodcut]] illustrations of various editions of Ovid, and specific classical [[relief]]s, as well as a well-known drawing by [[Michelangelo]] of the ''Risen Christ'' (British Museum).  The book illustrations "all show Perseus wearing a winged helmet like Mercury, for which there is no textual justification, and carrying a small baroque parade shield, features which Titian may later have remembered."&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355; [[:File:BM Wilde 54.jpg|The Michelangelo drawing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Poesie''==
[[File:After van Dyck Titian.jpg|thumb|Copy in the [[British Museum]] of the drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook, now [[Chatsworth House]], perhaps after a drawing by Titian.]]
The first two of the ''poesie'' series were ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' and ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'', delivered in 1553 and late 1554 respectively.  Both of these were repetitions with variations of compositions Titian had already painted in the previous decade for the [[Farnese family]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Venus and Adonis'' composition has an uncertain earlier history, for which see the article, or Penny, 280–284.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter from Titian to Philip accompanying the ''Venus and Adonis'', he noted that the pair offered contrasting poses, and promised "another different view" in both ''Perseus and Andromeda'' and a ''Jason and Medea'' he intended to produce.  These were to be the first original compositions in the series for Philip, but there is no trace of the ''Jason and Medea'', which was presumably abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356, 359 note 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'' is designed as a companion to ''Perseus and Andromeda''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of Perseus and Andromeda developed through several stages, which can be traced through x-rays and [[infra-red reflectography]], and a surviving drawing.  Some of the earlier elements can still be seen to the naked eye on close examination of the painting.  At first Andromeda was on the right, in a fairly similar pose, but leaning from left to right as in the final picture.  The arm to the left was raised above her head in a similar fashion, but the other arm more or less horizontal, and the head presumably looking to the centre.  There is a drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook (now [[Chatsworth House]]) recording such a figure, probably copying a lost drawing by Titian,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349, reproduced 352, 357&lt;/ref&gt; a rarity by this stage in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 204&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Veronese-persée-rennes.jpg|thumb|The painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] now in [[Rennes]], 1576–78, which is similar to the Titian when reversed]]
 
When Andromeda was moved to the left of the painting her pose was different from the final painting, more similar to the original one when she was on the right. There were several different positions, some taken no further than [[underdrawing]], for Perseus' limbs, sword and shield.  The monster originally rose higher out of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 352, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dissident view, Rearick sees the Wallace collection canvas as a second version, the original being the one delivered to Philip in 1556, and now lost, with Andromeda on the right. He sees a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] in [[Rennes]] as a paraphrase of this version.&lt;ref&gt;Rearick, 44–50, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, probably by 1558, Titian painted for Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] a ''[[St Margaret and the Dragon (Titian)|St Margaret and the Dragon]]'' (now Prado) which, with the removal of Perseus, more clothes, and a cross carried by [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], shows much the same situation, with a cliff, the sea, and a city across a bay.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 534-535&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Philip received the painting at [[Ghent]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in September 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356–357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1574 Titian had still not been paid, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and [[favourite]] [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]].  It appears to have left the Spanish royal collection before Philip's death in 1598 (the only ''poesie'' to do so), but was replaced by a careful copy, now in [[Gerona, Spain]].  It may have been given to Pérez, as other important paintings were.  This would have been before his drastic fall from favour in 1579.&lt;ref name="I357" &gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it may have been given to the family of the court sculptors [[Leone Leoni]] and his son Pompeo, also given paintings by Philip.  The Leoni family may have bought it when the collections of Pérez were dispersed.  There are records of paintings of the subject in the collections of Pérez in 1585–86 (described as "grande" or large), of Leon Bautista Leoni on his death in 1605 ("a damaged Andromeda by Titian") and of his father Pompeo Leoni on his death in 1608 (described as large, and by Titian).  All of these may refer to this painting, but this is not certain.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

The painting was certainly in the collection of [[Anthony van Dyck]], who may have acquired it from the Leoni family, who were based in [[Milan]], during his years in Italy from 1621 to 1627.  It was listed among his paintings on his death in London in 1641, and bought in 1646 by one of van Dyck's best customers, [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland]], together with Titian's ''[[Portrait of the Vendramin Family]]'' (now [[National Gallery]]).  Northumberland paid £200 for the pair, and a further £80 in 1656. However, it does not seem to have been owned by Northumberland for long, and was in France by 1654, and possibly by 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 220; Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1654 it was in the Paris house of the politician [[Louis Phélypeaux, seigneur de La Vrillière]], where it remained until 1717, sold with the house in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

It then joined the famous [[Orleans Collection]] of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Regent of France,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 461–468 for a general account of the collection&lt;/ref&gt; to be re-united with four others of Titian's ''poesie'', and two other versions by Titian of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]''.  By this time only Philip's versions of that and ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' remained in the Spanish royal collection, and are now in the [[Prado]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357; in 2013 it emerged that the Prado's ''Danaë'' was not in fact the one sent to Philip, though of very high quality.  See [[Danaë_(Titian_series)#Philip_II.27s_version.2C_and_the_Prado.27s|their article]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most of the rest of the Orleans Italian paintings, it moved to London where the collection was dispersed after the [[French Revolution]] in a complicated series of transactions,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 464–467&lt;/ref&gt; in some of which it was wrongly described as formerly in the collection of [[Charles I of England]].  In 1798 it was valued at 700 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] but failed to sell, selling for 310 gn. in 1800, and £362 in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358; see Penny, 341 for the seller in 1815, the son of Sir [[Gregory Page-Turner]], who was possibly the buyer in 1805.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was much less than the £2,500 gn the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]], one of the syndicate handling the sales, paid for each of [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] and  ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', other ''poesie''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 254&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bertelli Perseus.jpg|thumb|[[Engraving]] by [[Ferrando Bertelli]]]]
The 1815 sale was the last time the painting came to the market. It was bought by the Earl of Yarmouth, from 1822 [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford]], father of the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|4th Marquess]], the main collector forming the Wallace Collection. The 3rd Marquess contributed relatively few pictures to the Wallace Collection, and those were mostly portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 9, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was initially not regarded as one of the stars of the collection.  Between 1842 and about 1854 it was stored in the [[Pantechnicon van|Pantechnicon repository]] in London, before moving to [[Wallace_Collection#Building|Hertford House]], now home of the Wallace Collection, where it has remained. An 1870 inventory records it in the "Lumber Room" there, described as by [[Domenichino]], and Ingamells notes disapprovingly that "between 1876 and 1897 [it] hung unglazed over a bath in [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace's]] dressing room", before being correctly identified and rescued from the steam.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies and prints==
The painting was not copied by Titian or his workshop, as the first two ''poesie'' were, but later copies exist. When Philip II gave the painting away, a copy was made for the Spanish royal collection, which in 1882 was sent to the museum in [[Gerona, Spain]]. The [[Hermitage Museum]] has a copy that probably once belonged to Prince [[Eugene of Savoy]].  The [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]], France has a 17th-century copy once in the [[Palace of Versailles]], where it was recorded in 1683.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

An [[engraving]] by the Venetian [[Ferrando Bertelli]] probably dates to the 1550s and is a close rendering, though extending the composition on all sides except the left, possibly reflecting the original size of the painting, which has been cut down to an unknown extent. [[Giovanni Battista Fontana (painter)|Giovanni Battista Fontana]] (1524–1587) produced two prints, one dated 1564 and not very similar, the other closer to the Titian and undated.  Neither are exactly reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357–358&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations to Ovid from the late 16th century on often adopt aspects, or the general layout of the painting, without being copies.  The many paintings of the subject in later centuries tended to follow Titian's reduction of the subject to the two main figures and the monster, although not copying his composition. The subject became especially popular in the 19th century.

'''Pierrette Bloch''' (June 16, 1928 – July 7, 2017) was a Paris-born Swiss painter and textile artist.

==Early life==
Pierrette Bloch was born on June 16, 1928 in Paris. In 1939, Bloch and her parents left France for Switzerland to escape the war. At the age of 15, she began living on her own in a hotel, which she says helped foster very early on a complete sense of independence and autonomy. She began her professional artistic training at the end of the 1940s, taking courses in the plastic arts in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00020969?rskey=Mn27bF&amp;result=1 Benezit Artist Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bloch began exhibiting her works in Paris and the United States in the 1950s. The ensemble of her works have their roots in the use of  "poor" materials such as ink, paper, mesh, and horsehair. The last of these, horsehair, began appearing in her work in the 1970s, with her first sculpture using horsehair created in 1979, and have become one of the key symbols of her work. The corpus of her work thus spans mediums, including drawings, collages and three-dimensional pieces, and falls into the category of postwar abstraction. Her work has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

A monograph on Pierrette Bloch was published in November 2013 by Musée Jenisch.

==Death==
Bloch died on July 7, 2017 in Paris at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dagen|first1=Philippe|title=Mort de Pierrette Bloch, artiste d’une " inextinguible continuité "|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2017/07/08/mort-de-pierrette-bloch-artiste-d-une-inextinguible-continuite_5157830_1655012.html|accessdate=July 9, 2017|work=Le Monde|date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of the work ceases to exist.")&lt;ref&gt;After a text by [[Marguerite Pilven]] in Paris-art.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48196">'''Radio propaganda''' is [[propaganda]] aimed at influencing attitudes towards a certain cause or position, delivered through radio broadcast. The power of radio propaganda came from its revolutionary nature. The radio, like later technological advances in the media, allowed information to be transmitted quickly and uniformly to vast populations. Internationally, the radio was an early and powerful recruiting tool for propaganda campaigns.

Before [[television]], radio was by far the most effective way to prevent or promote social change. In many areas, it still is. Radio propaganda can be broadcast over great distances to a large audience at a relatively low cost. Through radio, a propagandist can bring his voice and all the persuasive power of his emotions to millions of people.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is used in every war employing radio propaganda: aside from convincing those on the home front of the necessity of war, a different kind of propaganda must be directed towards the enemy. Radio became a powerful [[propaganda]] tool because it ignored national borders and made enemy lines more accessible. One of the most common ways hosts got the civilian and enemy populations to listen to their broadcasts was by dropping leaflets from hot air balloons or airplanes. Most programs were broadcast on selected stations at certain times of the day; the dropped leaflets explained exactly when and where the broadcasts could be heard.

==World War II==
The use of radio as a wartime propaganda tool was made famous during World War II by broadcasting organizations such as [[Voice of America]] and by shows such as [[Tokyo Rose]], [[Axis Sally]], and [[Lord Haw Haw]].

=== Nazi Germany ===
The radio was an important tool of the [[Nazi propaganda]] efforts and it has been argued that it was the Nazis who pioneered the use of what was still a relatively new technology. A few months after the break out of World War II, German propagandists were transmitting no less than eleven hours a day of programs, offering most of them in English as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of Nazi propaganda programming, broadcasters attempted to destroy pro-British feeling rather than arouse pro-German sentiment. These propagandists targeted certain groups, including capitalists, Jews, and selected newspapers/politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 207&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1940, the Nazis had abandoned all attempts to win American sympathy and the tone of German radio broadcasts towards the [[United States]] had become critical.

German propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], was well aware of the necessity to seize every opportunity to benefit and promote the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Goebbels claimed the radio was the "eighth great power" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Propaganda Archive|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb56.htm|work=The Radio as the Eight Great Power|publisher=Joseph Goebbels|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he, along with the Nazi party, recognized the power of the radio in the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany. Recognizing the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message, Goebbels approved a mandate whereby millions of cheap radio sets were subsidized by the government and distributed to German citizens. It was Goebbels' job to propagate the anti-Bolshevik statements of Hitler and aim them directly at neighboring countries with German-speaking minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Goebbels' "Radio as the Eighth Great Power" speech, he proclaimed:

: “It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio...It is no exaggeration to say that the German revolution, at least in the form it took, would have been impossible without the airplane and the radio…[Radio] reached the entire nation, regardless of class, standing, or religion. That was primarily the result of the tight centralization, the strong reporting, and the up-to-date nature of the German radio.”

As well as domestic broadcasts, the Nazi regime used the radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states. One of the main targets was the [[United Kingdom]] to which [[William Joyce]] broadcast regularly, gaining him the nickname “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]” in the process. Broadcasts were also made to the [[United States]], notably through [[Robert Henry Best]] and 'Axis Sally', [[Mildred Gillars]].

===Great Britain===
British propaganda during the [[First World War]] set a new benchmark that inspired the fascist and socialist regimes during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]; Marshal Paul von Hindenburg stated, “This English propaganda was a new weapon, or rather a weapon which had never been employed on such a scale and so ruthlessly in the past.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It was clear that large numbers of civilians could be mobilized for a massive war effort through persuasive techniques derived from the emerging disciplines of behavioral psychology and social sciences.

An example of effective radio propaganda by the [[United States]] for [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] is the news reports of [[Edward R. Murrow]]. When the United Kingdom stood alone to face the German onslaught in the autumn of 1940, Murrow covered the [[Battle of Britain]] and particularly the nightly [[The Blitz|bombing raids]] on [[London]]. His reports described the falling of the bombs, their impact, and the destruction they brought.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Murrow developed his own inimitable style, known for its colourful, vivid imagery. Neither melancholy nor soapy, his reports were so rich in detail and description that listeners could almost smell the fumes from the fires burning in the streets of London and feel the heat emanating from the smoldering ruins. Without question, this was radio reporting at its best, and there was also no doubt about its impact. As he described his approach to a London newspaper in 1941, “The official news is perhaps less important than the more intimate stories of life, work, and sacrifice.”&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Murrow kept his focus squarely on the common man and how to reach him. He wanted to let the world know that the United Kingdom was fighting a “people’s war,” not a war for its colonies, as the American isolationists charged.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted Americans to know that the UK was standing tall, united in its cause and protecting Western liberties and European civilisation. He wanted Americans to see the UK as their natural ally and hurry to extend a helping hand. Because of his reputation and impact, Murrow’s role evolved into much more than that of a broadcaster. Many say he had far greater influence than the American ambassador to London; “He was an ambassador, in a double role, representing Britain in America as well as America in Britain.... He was a diplomat without a portfolio, a spokesman for a cause.” &lt;ref&gt;Horten&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Historians believe the moment when American radio made its debut as the preeminent means of foreign news was the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938. Early that month, Hitler began implementing his plans to dominate Europe by demanding self-determination for Germans living in a region of Czechoslovakia known as the [[Sudetenland]]. He left few doubts that he meant to annex the Sudetenland as part of an enlarged [[German Reich]]. High-level negotiations ensued, during which Britain’s Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], journeyed to Germany three times in less than three weeks in a desperate attempt to save the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful that a European war would once again entangle them, Americans became glued to their radios for daily and sometimes hourly updates and interpretations of the latest developments of the crisis. Within a couple of days, American listeners were bombarded with news programs, special news bulletins, and expert commentary on the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Horten, pg.22&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s first real venture into international broadcasting was in 1940 after Nazi victories in Europe, when the Roosevelt administration was becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of Nazi propaganda, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1940, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order establishing the Office of Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations to promote the use of government/private radio, and the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]]. By 1942, the most famous radio program airing overseas became known as the “[[Voice of America]].” Even before the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information began providing war news and commentary to commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America:Origins and Recollections|year=2009|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular government wartime radio show, performed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was known as "fireside chats". Two of the most famous programs on the radio show were entitled "On National Security" and "On the Declaration of War with Japan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fireside Chats|url=http://www.history.com/topics/fireside-chats|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Arsenal of Democracy” was a slogan coined by President Roosevelt during his national security radio broadcast delivered on December 29, 1940. Roosevelt promised to help [[Great Britain]] fight Nazi Germany by providing them with military supplies in a program known as [[Lend-Lease]], while the United States stayed out of the actual fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Arsenal of Democracy|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrarsenalofdemocracy.html|publisher=American Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement was made a year before the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]], at a time when Germany had occupied much of Europe and threatened Great Britain. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt delivered his famous [[Infamy Speech]] to the [[United States]], which was broadcast to the American people. The President called for a formal declaration of war on the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Infamy Speech was brief, running to just a little over seven minutes, and Roosevelt made a point of emphasizing that the United States and her interests were in grave danger. In so doing, he sought to end the [[isolationist]] stance the United States had previously been advocating concerning involvement in the war. The overall tone of the speech was one of determined [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. Roosevelt made no attempt to glaze over the extensive damage that had been caused to the American armed forces, noting the number of American lives lost in the attack. However, he emphasized his confidence in the strength of the America to face the challenge posed by Japan.

:“Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.”

:“As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.”

:“Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces, with the un-bounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.”

:President Franklin D. Roosevelt - December 8, 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For a Declaration of War|url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/fdr-infamy.htm|publisher=The History Place: Great Speeches Collection|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this declaration of war, radio became part of the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in [[American propaganda]]. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called ''Stimmen aus Amerika'' ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and included the pledge: "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Walter|title=The Voice of America: Origins and Recollations|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html|publisher=American Diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] created a number of radio shows for American GIs stationed overseas.  The most popular of these "mosquito networks" was [[GI Jive]].  In Agra, India, [[Virginia C. Claudon Allen]] broadcast nightly to counter [[Tokyo Rose]].

===Famous radio shows===
During [[World War II]], American [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] in both the Pacific and European theaters of war heard anonymous voices on the radio playing carefully selected American music and extolling the virtues of Japanese and Nazi causes. The [[Disc jockey|DJs]] continuously encouraged GIs to stop fighting and constantly made false claims of American defeats and Japanese or Nazi victories. They frequently referred to specific American units and individuals by name, and in rare cases mentioned the names of loved ones back home. GIs dubbed the voice from Japan "[[Tokyo Rose]]"; two popular voices from Germany were "Axis Sally" and “[[Lord Haw-Haw]]”.

"Tokyo Rose": After being stranded in Japan while visiting her sick aunt after the United States refused to let her reenter the country after the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[Iva Toguri]] wound up at [[Radio Tokyo]] as a typist, preparing English-language scripts drafted by Japanese authorities for broadcast to the Allied troops in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Radio Tokyo, Toguri met captured Australian Major Charles Cousens and his associates, American Captain Wallace Ince and Filipino Lieutenant Normando Reyes. A supporter of the Allies in the war, she was delighted to meet soldiers who had been fighting for her side. Put off by her overt friendliness and pro-Americanism, the POWs initially suspected her of being a [[Kempeitai]] spy, but over the next few months they eventually came to trust her. When Radio Tokyo directed Cousens to include a woman DJ in his Zero Hour program, he asked for Toguri by name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their capture and conscription into Radio Tokyo, the Allied POWs had waged a covert campaign to sabotage the Japanese propaganda effort through the use of on-air innuendos, satire, and sarcastic, rushed or muffled readings. Now they had to bring a fourth party into the conspiracy, and the only person they could trust to support their efforts was Toguri. She was dubbed with the name "Tokyo Rose" and listeners came to know her by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iva Toguri mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|Iva Toguri "Tokyo Rose".]]

After the war, the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the press continued to refer to Toguri by that name as she was taken into custody and brought to trial. Those defending Toguri stated that she was clearly "forced" to broadcast for the Japanese and was always a loyal American, shown by her many attempts to return home, which were continuously rejected. They also pointed to the lack of "tangible" evidence; American investigators never discovered any Japanese documents with the name "[[Tokyo Rose]]" because "[[Tokyo Rose]]" was a name coined by American GIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iva Toguri d’Aquino and "Tokyo Rose"|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/tokyo-rose|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[United States Constitution]], [[treason]] is the act of providing "aid and comfort" to an enemy. It does not say that force, loneliness, trickery, coercion, or fright are mitigating factors in favor of traitors. On October 6, 1949, Toguri was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $10,000. She served less than half that time and was pardoned by President [[Gerald Ford]].

"Axis Sally" was the pseudonym of [[Mildred Gillars]], an American broadcaster employed by the [[Third Reich]] in Nazi Germany to proliferate propaganda during World War II. By 1941, the [[U.S. State Department]] advised American nationals to return home, but Gillars chose to stay in Germany after her fiancé, a German citizen named Paul Karlson, refused to marry her if she returned to the United States. Shortly afterwards, Karlson was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], where he died in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she obtained work as an announcer with the ''Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft'' (RRG), German State Radio. On December 7, 1941, Gillars was working in the studio when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was announced. She broke down in front of her colleagues and announced her allegiance to the East. However, since she decided to stay in Germany, Gillar was faced with the prospect of joblessness or prison, so she produced a written oath of allegiance to Germany and returned to work, her duties being limited to announcing records and participating in chat shows. She soon acquired several names amongst her GI listeners, including Berlin Bitch, Berlin Babe, Olga, and Sally, but the one that became most common was “Axis Sally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally: The American behind the Alluring Voice|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Richard Lucas|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AxisSallyMugshot.jpg|thumb|right|Mildred Gillars "Axis Sally".]]

Her most successful show was known as ''Home Sweet Home''. ''Home Sweet Home'' attempted to exploit the fears of American soldiers about the home front. The broadcasts were designed to make the soldiers cast doubt on their mission, their leaders, and their prospects after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axis Sally, "The Greatest Generation," and Generation Y|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Ann Elizabeth Pfau|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another show was known as ''Midge at the Mike'', broadcast to late fall 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillar played American songs interspersed with defeatist propaganda and anti-Semitic rhetoric, as well as ''G.I.’s Letter box and Medical Reports'' in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Axis Sally|journal=FoIA record|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Gillars used information on wounded and captured U.S. airmen to cause fear and worry in their families. She was convicted of treason by the United States in 1949 following her capture in post-war Berlin. Her arrest came about after the U.S. attorney general specially dispatched prosecutor Victor C. Woerheide to Berlin to find and arrest Gillars. He only had one solid lead: Raymond Kurtz, a B-17 pilot shot down by the Germans, recalled that a woman who had visited his prison camp seeking interviews was the broadcaster. Gillars was indicted on September 10, 1948, and charged with 10 counts of treason, but only eight were presented at her trial, which began on January 25, 1949. The prosecution relied on the large number of her programs recorded by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to demonstrate her active participation in propaganda activities against the United States. It was also shown that she had made an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=True to the Red, White, &amp; Blue|journal=TIME Magazine|date=Mar 7, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

"Lord Haw-Haw" was a pseudonym for [[William Joyce]], German radio's most prominent English-language speaker. He hosted a propaganda show on a radio program called ''Germany Calling'', broadcast by Nazi German radio to audiences in Great Britain on the station
''Reichssender Hamburg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M.|first=Doherty|title=Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War|year=2000|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program started on September 18, 1939 and continued until April 30, 1945, when [[Hamburg]] was overrun by the British Army. Through his broadcasts, the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] attempted to discourage and demoralize British, Canadian, Australian, and American troops and the British population within radio range to suppress the effectiveness of the Allied war effort through propaganda and to motivate the Allies to agree to peace terms leaving the Nazi regime intact and in power. The Nazi broadcasts prominently reported on the shooting down of Allied aircraft and the sinking of Allied ships, presenting discouraging reports of high losses and casualties among Allied forces. Although listening to his broadcasts was highly discouraged, many Britons did indeed tune into them. In 1940, at the height of his influence, Joyce had an estimated 6 million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weider History Group|url=http://www.historynet.com/axis-sally.htm/1|work=Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, Joyce was captured by British forces at [[Flensburg]], near the German border with [[Denmark]]. Spotting a dishevelled figure resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers engaged him in conversation, asked if he was Joyce, and when he reached in his pocket for his false passport, the soldiers, believing he was armed, shot him in the buttocks, leaving four wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Martin|title=Geoffrey Perry|year=2009|publisher=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce was charged on the basis that, even though he had misstated his nationality to gain possession of a British passport, until it expired this entitled him to British diplomatic protection in Germany, and therefore he owed allegiance to the King of England at the time he commenced working for the Germans. Joyce was convicted and sentenced to death on September 19, 1945.

==Cold War==
By 1946, it became clear to the United States that the [[Soviet Union]] did not share the American vision of postwar collaboration for peace in Europe. Soviet authorities began to install Communist regimes in liberated territories of [[Eastern Europe]], a direct violation of the provisions in the [[Teheran Conference|Teheran]] and [[Yalta Conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The radio became crucial in the propaganda war between the two blocs and was the main concern of both participants’ information agencies as the “war of ideas” began. In 1948, the Soviet Union organized the Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]), which was formed to unite the Communist states in forthcoming struggle against “Anglo-American Imperialism.” &lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest responses in Europe was known as [[Radio in the American Sector]] (RIAS). RIAS was established in 1946 to serve the American sector in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The station's importance was magnified during the 1948 Berlin blockade, when it carried the message of Allied determination to resist Soviet intimidation. In East Germany, broadcasts included news, commentary, and cultural programs that were unavailable in the controlled media of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The management of RIAS developed many of the techniques later used to develop [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The RIAS broadcasts concentrated on the idea of democracy and the importance of the breakdown of the international communications barriers erected by the Communists. The programming was generally geared towards “special groups” within the East German population, including youth, women, farmers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast became known as the “bridge” from West to East Germany over the [[Berlin Wall]].

Aside from RIAS, [[Voice of America]] (VOA) began broadcasting in 1947 in the Soviet Union for the first time as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. Initially, there was only one hour per day of news and other features broadcast on the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union responded by initiating aggressive, electronic jamming of Voice of America broadcasts on April 24, 1949. This led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold War Impact of VOA Broadcasts|journal=Hoover Institution and the Cold War International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many acknowledged the importance of propaganda as an instrument of foreign policy, it was primarily the Cold War that institutionalized propaganda as a permanent instrument of U.S. foreign policy. The Soviets suddenly increased the tempo of the war, by taking over Czechoslovakia and attempting to take complete control of Berlin. Realizing there was no further hope of considering the Soviet Union as an ally, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] was formed in April 1949, establishing the policy of containment of Communism as the organization's priority. The escalation of the Cold War intensified America’s interest in broadcasting and information policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The world was entering into a new era of foreign relations; therefore, the [[United States National Security Council]] produced a study in 1949 that concluded that there was a need for the United States to have a major information program to counter Soviet aggression. The council issued document 10/2, approved by President Truman in June 1948, authorizing a comprehensive program of clandestine warfare, including [[black propaganda]], [[psychological warfare]], [[subversion]], assistance to underground resistance movements, paramilitary operations, and [[economic warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous form of anti-Soviet propaganda was the development of Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL), which broadcast to Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The stations' purpose, above all, was fighting a political mission against [[Communism]] and Sovietism, against the representatives of the terrorist regimes. Its job was to mask Communist plans and expose all of those who were propagandist of Communist ideology. While other countries established international broadcasting entities, RFE/RL’s purpose was to change the form of government in foreign nations by airing news not about the country from which the broadcasts originated, but about the countries that were the targets of the broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

President Harry Truman announced in 1950 that the United States would launch an information program known as the “Campaign of Truth.” The name was strategically picked to avoid any connotation of propaganda. The goals of the campaign included:
:1) Establish a “healthy international community” with confidence in American leadership.
:2) Present America fairly and counter “all the misrepresentations.”
:3) Discourage further Soviet encroachment by showing that American is desirous of peace but is prepared for war.
:4) Help “to roll back Soviet influence” by all means short of force, making captive people feel that they can identify with the West, weakening the morale of the Soviet military personnel, and encouraging non-Communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1950, RFE/RL began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a "mouthpiece for exiles."&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Teams of journalists were hired for each language service and an elaborate system of intelligence gathering provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected [[émigrés]] and interviews with travelers and defectors. The Communist regimes devoted considerable resources to countering Western broadcasts. They organized radio jamming on a massive scale, spending more on jamming than the West did on broadcasting. They placed spies in Western radio stations in an attempt to disrupt information sharing and organize [[counterpropaganda]], while also attempting to gain access to top level officials who could provide them with information controlled by [[Western media outlets]] or intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; These countermeasures by foreign regimes significantly drained domestic resources, and failed to neutralize Western broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Parta, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, the practice of propaganda became inextricably tied to the practices of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, psychological warfare was largely seen as an accessory to military operations, but during the Cold War psychological warfare was utilized to influence public opinion and advance foreign policy interests. Psychological warfare became, in essence, a synonym for the Cold War. It reflected the belief that the Cold War was an ideological, psychological, and cultural contest for hearts and minds that would be won or lost on the plain of public opinion. When President John F. Kennedy took office, his administration had a greater interest in the U.S. information effort than any other president up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; With Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]’s address to the Soviet Central Committee in 1961, U.S. leaders believed the Soviet Union would be ready to seek a more limited form of conflict, emphasizing their winning of hearts and minds. The United States saw this as a good sign to use psychological resources to their advantage. However, these components of propaganda were put on hold with the [[Bay of Pigs]] scandal, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the abrupt end of the Kennedy Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam==
The first Vietnamese-language radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the Declaration of Independence. Prior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from [[Hanoi]] the week after declaration of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], stating, "This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.” During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of [[North Vietnam]]. Following reunification, all radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.

"Hanoi Hannah" or Trịnh Thị Ngọ, was a Vietnamese radio personality best known for her work during the Vietnam War, when she made English-language broadcasts for North Vietnam directed at U.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, Ngo became famous among U.S. soldiers for her [[propaganda]] broadcasts on Radio Hanoi. She made three broadcasts a day, reading the list of the newly killed or imprisoned Americans, attempting to persuade U.S. GIs that the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was unjust and immoral and playing popular U.S. anti-war songs in an attempt to incite feelings of nostalgia and homesickness amongst U.S. troops. Although she used the alias Thu Huong, the GIs usually called her "[[Hanoi Hannah]]" or "the Dragon Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few were believed to have been influenced by her propaganda work and the soldiers often mocked her tactics, but they were also impressed by her military intelligence, especially when she mentioned the location of their own unit or listed specific U.S. casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for Hanoi Hannah|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/hannah.html|work=Don North|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, she returned to live in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] with her husband where her voice was better known in the U.S. than in her own country.

==Iraq and Afghanistan==
The United States took the lead in broadcasting [[psychological operations]] due to its superior technology and its ability to use aircraft to broadcast AM, FM and shortwave radio from directly above target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; America had dropped battery or crank-powered radios on third-world nations like [[Haiti]] so that the populace could hear U.S. broadcasts. In the more recent struggles in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the United States distributed various battery and solar-powered satellite radios so that its story could be heard. The U.S. also dropped leaflets to inform Afghans about the attacks of September 11 and the Taliban, and to infiltrate Iraq with information on anti-Saddam radio programs that would be broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSNEWS|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-533414.|work=U.S. Propaganda Push in Iraq|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 [[invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP) tactics were employed to demoralize the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages even before the United States invaded Afghanistan. The primary PSYOP objectives were used to counter adversarial propaganda, to discourage interference with humanitarian affairs activities, to support objectives against state and non-state supporters and sponsors of terrorism, and to disrupt support for and relationships among terrorist organizations. In Afghanistan, the U.S. military has long conducted propaganda campaigns to try to sway public opinion against insurgents. Today (2013), the U.S. is teaching Afghan army units how to counter Taliban propaganda, especially with local radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Current News Early Bird|url=http://214.14.134.30/ebird2/ebfiles/e20121105910138.html|work=U.S. Handoff In Afghanistan Includes Radio Training|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to counter the Taliban-sponsored stations, so called "Mullah Radios," that operate mainly in the tribal areas along the Pakistani border and broadcast propaganda that helps turn public opinion against foreign troops and the pro-Western Afghan government. Radio is key to reaching the majority of Afghans; with only limited access to television, newspapers, and the Internet, most depend on radio programs for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston.com|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/09/17/us_radio_takes_on_taliban_in_afghan_propaganda_war/|work=U.S. Radio takes on Taliban in Afghan Propaganda War|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Iraq War]], the U.S. implemented "[[black propaganda]]" by creating false radio personalities who disseminated pro-American information, but were supposedly supporters of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Radio Tikrit was a radio station in Iraq that broadcast programs that reflected strong support for the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his government. The station's name is also the name of the Iraqi town where Saddam and other members of his government were born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schleifer|first=Ron|title=Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq|year=2005|publisher=Middle East Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tone of Radio Tikrit's programs began to change dramatically; one show reportedly described Iraqis as being so poor that they had to sell their windows and doors. Another broadcast reported to have encouraged Iraqi soldiers to refuse the "orders of the tyrant" and to "be brave before it is too late,” suggesting that the United States may have infiltrated the station. The U.S. was also successful with the Voice of America efforts once the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Sol|title=A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq|year=2008|publisher=Military Review|pages=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice of America==

Voice of America, The Voice, or VOA is the official external broadcast institution of the United States federal government, sponsoring programming for broadcast on the radio, television, and the Internet outside of the U.S. in 43 languages. Currently, VOA produces about 1,500 hours of news and feature programming each week to global audience in order, "to promote freedom and democracy and to enhance understanding through multimedia communication of accurate, objective, and balanced news, information and other programming about America and the world to audiences overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Board of Governors|url=http://www.bbg.gov/about-the-agency/|work=About the Agency: Our Mission|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under § 501 of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]] of 1948, the Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens until July 2013&lt;ref name=chuck_nbc_2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us|title=Taxpayer money at work: US-funded foreign broadcasts finally available in the US|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was repealed in the ''Smith-Mundt Modernization Act'' provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|National Defense Authorization Act for 2013]].&lt;ref name="smma"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=U.S. Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News to Americans|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/12/us_backs_off_propaganda_ban_spreads_government_made_news_to_americans|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the legislation was to protect the American public from [[propaganda]] actions by its own government.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1976, the principles were signed into law by President [[Gerald Ford]]:
:“The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts:
:1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.
:2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.
:3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.”

Today, the VOA operates shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at one site in the [[United States]] close to Greenville, North Carolina. The 44 languages that [[Voice of America]] currently broadcasts in include (TV broadcasts are marked with an asterisk):

From 1942 to 1945, VOA was part of the [[Office of War Information]], from 1945 to 1953, a function of the [[State Department]], and in 1953 it was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency]]. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, the VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), where the control remains today. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference.

In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet in English and 44 other languages, using more than 20,000 servers across 71 countries. Since many listeners in Africa and other areas still receive much of their information via radio and have only limited access to computers, VOA continues to maintain regular shortwave-radio broadcasts.

==Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty==
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a broadcaster funded by the [[United States Congress]] that provides news, information, and analysis to countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and the [[Middle East]]  "where the free flow of information is either banned by government authorities or not fully developed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/section/FAQ/777.html#section5|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RFE/RL is supervised by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], alongside [[Voice of America]].

Founded as an anti-Communist propaganda source during the Cold War, RFE/RL was headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, from 1949 to 1995. In 1995, the headquarters were moved to [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], where operations have been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the headquarters, the service maintains 20 local bureaus in countries throughout their broadcast region, including a corporate office in [[Washington, D.C.]] RFE/RL broadcasts in 28 languages to 21 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://flashvideo.rferl.org/Flashmaps/en-US/coverageOneWin/default.htm|work=Fast Facts|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Iraq]].

RFE/RL was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; American policymakers such as [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]] and [[John Foster Dulles]] acknowledged that the Cold War was essentially a “war of ideas”.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]], acting through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], funded a long list of projects to counter the Communist appeal in Europe and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, Pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The missions of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] were separate from [[Voice of America]] in the sense that VOA was meant to be the voice of America, reflecting American foreign policy and disseminating world news from an official American viewpoint, whereas RFE/RL has the mission of captivating people and stimulating non-cooperation in Communist countries.

The '''Shpilman Institute for Photography''' (SIP) was an Israeli non profit organisation which promoted [[photography]] worldwide.

==History==
SIP was founded in 2010 Shalom Shpilman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/the-engineer-who-put-together-a-startlingly-efficient-photograph-collection.premium-1.433168|title=The engineer who put together a startlingly efficient photograph collection|author=Daniel Rauchwerger|date=29 May 2012|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote [[photography]] as an art in [[Israel]] and worldwide. The institute, located in [[Tel Aviv]], hosts exhibitions, lectures and various artistic activities by people in the field of photography and media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artandeducation.net/client/shpilman_institute_for_pho/|title=Shpilman Institute for Photography|work=Art &amp; Education | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIP also provides ground and holds academic research. It offers grants and scholarships to projects, both locally in [[Israel]] and internationally. 

In addition to hosting temporary exhibitions, the SIP had a permanent collection with over 900 works, including photographs by [[Erwin Blumenfeld]], Frederick Sommer, Berenice Abbott, [[Arthur Siegel]], Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, [[Man Ray]], Cecil Beaton, Elliott Erwitt, [[Bill Brandt]], Andre Breton, [[Claude Cahun]], [[Salvador Dali]], Harry Callahan, Paul Heismann, [[Yasuhiro Ishimoto]], [[Adi Nes]], [[Jeff Wall]], [[Uri Gershuni]], [[Ilit Azulay]], [[Deganit Berest]], [[Eli Lotar]], [[Ohad Matalon]], [[Lee Miller]] and [[Michal Heiman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thesip.org/language/en/artist/millerbio-en/ | title=Miller Lee | access-date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of end 2016, Shpilman Institute of Photography ceased its activities and sold its permanent collection at [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]]. Fifty-five works from the collection were purchased by [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2784326|title=Israel Museum purchased 55 works from Shpilman collection|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation site's latest update was at the end of 2014 and the institute premises were vacated at the beginning of 2015. The [[Shpilman International Prize for Excellence in Photography]] remains active though patronage of Israel Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/en/2015/11/10/article/159877221/christies-collection-shpilman/|title=Christie’s : Shalom Shpilman Collection|work=loeildelaphotographie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.2477679|title=מכון שפילמן לצילום ימכור חלקים גדולים מהאוסף שלו - אמנות - הארץ|trans-title=Shpilman Institute of Photography to sell its permanent collection|language=|work=Haaretz.com | access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2157">The '''Symphony on a French Mountain Air''' ({{lang-fr|'''Symphonie sur un chant montagnard français''' }}), [[opus number|Op.]] 25, written in [[1886 in music|1886]] by [[Vincent d'Indy]], is virtually the only work by the composer that still receives regular performances today. 

As indicated by the title, d'Indy took the principal [[theme (music)|theme]] from a [[French folk music|folk song]] he heard at Périer overlooking the [[Cévennes]] mountains (hence the work's alternative name, '''''Symphonie cévenole''''').  Originally conceived as a [[Fantasia (music)|fantaisie]] for piano and orchestra, the symphony is unusual in that it is scored for a prominent (but never dominant) [[piano]] part together with [[orchestra]], and has acquired the label [[sinfonia concertante]] from some critics.  

It consists of three [[movement (music)|movements]] and lasts just under half an hour:
*''Assez [[Tempo#French_tempo_markings|lent]] - Modérément animé''
*''Assez [[Tempo#French_tempo_markings|modéré]], mais sans lenteur''
*''Animé''
The symphony begins with an evocative melody played first by a [[cor anglais]].  The main themes of subsequent movements are based on this melody, and as the symphony progresses each subsequent variation becomes more and more like the original version.

The work was dedicated to [[Marie-Léontine Bordes-Pène]], who was the soloist at the premiere in Paris on March 20, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Blom]], ed., [[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], 5th ed, 1954, Vol. I, p. 814&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba''''' is an oil painting by [[Claude Lorrain]] (born Claude Gellée, traditionally known as Claude), in the [[National Gallery]], London, signed and dated 1648. The large oil on canvas painting was commissioned by [[Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne]], [[Duc de Bouillon]], general of the [[Papal army]], together with Claude's ''Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca''. It depicts the departure of the [[Queen of Sheba]] to visit to [[King Solomon]] in Jerusalem, described in the tenth chapter of the [[Books of Kings|First Book of Kings]].  A more usual subject would be their meeting; this is one of many harbour scenes painted by Claude. The Queen is departing from a city with classical buildings, with the early morning sun lighting the sea, as vessels are loaded.

The composition draws the eye to a group of people on the steps to the right, at the intersection of a line of perspective (the steps) and a strong vertical (the left column of the building's portico).  The Queen wears a pink tunic, royal blue cloak, and golden crown, and is about to board a waiting launch to take her to her ship – perhaps the ship partially concealed by the pillars to the left, or the one further out to sea, over the picture's [[vanishing point]].  

The painting was one of the first works to be acquired by the National Gallery in 1824, being one of five works by Claude Lorrain bought from the collection of [[John Julius Angerstein]]. It has the catalogue number NG14. This and similar works by Claude inspired [[J. M. W. Turner]] to paint ''[[Dido Building Carthage]]'' and ''[[The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire]]'', which Turner left to the nation as part of the Turner Bequest on the condition that they were to be hung besides Claude's pair of works.

It is numbered 114 in Claude's ''[[Liber Veritatis]]''.

Web. 15 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1850 in London, UK.  De Morgan was a successful Victorian Era children's short story writer. In her writing career, De Morgan developed three individual collections which started with ''On a Pincushion'' (1877), then ''The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde'' (1880), and finally, ''The Windfairies'' (1900). The first two collections were successfully published by 1800 and her career as a Victorian Era writer continued to flourish. De Morgan aimed to create stories that recreated her brother's illustrations. Her focus was reading to young children her written works of short stories in the Victorian fairy-tale genres. Tragically, De Morgan died in Egypt in 1907.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. "'The Golden Harp': Mary de Morgan's Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature ."

==Summary==
The story tells the cycle of three young men, the king's nephews, who attempt to rule the kingdom after the death of their uncle, King Ronald. The eldest nephew, Aldovrand, is first in line to test his abilities as king. Aldovrand proves to be selfish in nature and demands extreme independence from all. The Prime Minister and [[Chancellor]] turns to Aldovrand, asking questions regarding the kingdom. Aldovrand does not like being disturbed by them and decides to run away. While leaving the kingdom Aldovrand runs into a farmer who offers him a job watching his geese. Next in line to test his abilities as king is the second nephew, Aldebert. Aldebert is confronted with conflicts such as increasing the army's wages, repairing the kingdom's city, and also saving money for the kingdom. He grants everyone's wishes but it resulted in great disagreement. Aldebert can not deal with the conflicting decisions and runs away. While leaving the kingdom, Aldebert runs into a tinker, who offeres him a job. Alderete, the last nephew is next to test his abilities as king. Excited to reign, Alderete explores the kingdom and commands that drastic lifestyle changes need to be made. The people in the city starts an uproar and protest against Alderete's demands. The pressure is too much, and Alderete runs away in fear. While he is leaving the kingdom, he runs into a chimney sweeper and becomes his apprentice. In panic, The Prime Minister and Chancellor return  to the three nephews pleading for them to become King. All three nephews decline and proceed happily with their new jobs leaving behind any luxuries and power that could have been theirs as King.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

==Moral==
Wealth, power, and luxuries are not key to one's happiness. Instead, pursue a career that fits one's interests, and happiness will follow.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53588">The '''Theatre of the Absurd''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de l'absurde}} {{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ(ə) də lapsyʁd|}}) is a post–World War II designation for particular [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[absurdist fiction]] written by a number of primarily European [[playwright]]s in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of [[existentialism]] and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theatre of the Absurd |first=Martin |last=Esslin |year=1961 |oclc=329986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD: THE WEST AND THE EAST |first=Jan |last=Culík |date=2000 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of [[Theatrical realism|realism]] and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

While absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the "after life" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In his book ''Absurd Drama'' (1965), Esslin wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely {{em|because}} there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Miguel Mihura]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[N.F. Simpson]], and [[Badal Sarkar]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Origin ==
In the first edition of ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to [[Albert Camus]]'s philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]], and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, [[Harold Pinter]]—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."&lt;ref name=Esslin1961ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esslin2004ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', 3rd ed. (New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Hodgson. ''The plays of Tom Stoppard: for stage, radio, TV and film''.Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|1-84046-241-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84046-241-8}}.pg.181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]],&lt;ref&gt;Joel Agee.

== Significant precursors ==
Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.

=== Elizabethan – tragicomedy ===
The mode of most "absurdist" plays is [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324"&gt;Esslin, pg. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Styan. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, 1983 {{ISBN|0-521-29629-3}}, pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Nell says in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''. Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Esslin cites [[William Shakespeare]] as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's ''[[Macbett]]'' and Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". ''The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi''. Grove Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-394-17198-2}}. pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from [[Commedia dell'arte]] to [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and [[music hall]] artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], the [[Keystone Cops]] and [[Buster Keaton]] as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' in 1965.)&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as [[Lewis Carroll]] or [[Edward Lear]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Polish playwright [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 382–385&lt;/ref&gt; the Russians [[Daniil Kharms]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell. ''The absurd in literature.'' Manchester University Press ND, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}. pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Erdman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Freedman. ''The major plays of Nikolai Erdman: The warrant and The suicide''. Routledge, 1995.{{ISBN|3718655837}}. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Distancing effect|distancing]] techniques in his "[[Epic theatre]]";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; and the "dream plays" of [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref name="Esslin1961ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name = StyanDark&gt;J. L. Styan. ''The dark comedy: the development of modern comic tragedy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-521-09529-8}}. pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs page numbers in citations throughout--&gt;

One commonly cited precursor is [[Luigi Pirandello]], especially ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name = StyanDark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". ''Contemporary American Drama''.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7486-2494-5}}.pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the [[fourth wall]] presupposed by the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;!--Page number references to citations needed throughout.--&gt; According to [[W. B. Worthen]], ''Six Characters'' and other Pirandello plays use "[[Metatheatre]]—[[roleplaying]], [[Play within a play|plays-within-plays]], and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of [[Personal identity|identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential playwright was [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] whose ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' was the first work to be called "[[Surrealism|surreal]]".&lt;ref name = Lewis260&gt;Allan Lewis. "The Theatre of the 'Absurd' – Beckett, Ionesco, Genet". ''The Contemporary Theatre: The Significant Playwrights of Our Time''. Crown Publishers, 1966. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Glasgow&gt;Rupert D. V. Glasgow. ''Madness, Masks, and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8386-3559-8}}. pg. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah B. Gaensbauer. ''The French theater of the absurd''. Twayne Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8057-8270-2}}. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
One of the most significant common precursors is [[Alfred Jarry]] whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious ''Ubu'' plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of [['pataphysics]]—"the science of imaginary solutions"—first presented in Jarry's ''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'' (''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Jill Fell. ''Alfred Jarry, an imagination in revolt''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8386-4007-9}}. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; was inspirational to many later Absurdists,&lt;ref name="Glasgow" /&gt; some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pag. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt; (Ionesco,&lt;ref name = Queneau&gt;Raymond Queneau, Marc Lowenthal.

Artaud's "[[Theatre of Cruelty|The Theatre of Cruelty]]" (presented in ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'') was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Artaud ''The Theatre and Its Double''.  Tr.

Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, [[Dadaism]] (for example, the Dadaist plays by [[Tristan Tzara]] performed at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain.

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''" ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''. Grove Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8021-5056-X}}. pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present Past, Past Present''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Fragments of a Journal''. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont. ''Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture''. University of Michigan Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre criticized ''Rhinoceros'' by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1966 interview, [[Claude Bonnefoy]], comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bonnefoy. ''Conversations with Eugène Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, [[Samuel Beckett]]'s primary focus was on the ''failure'' of man to overcome "absurdity" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in ''Damned to Fame'', Beckett's work focuses, "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said, though he liked ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', he generally found the writing style of Sartre and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a [[Rive Gauche]]) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the [[Quartier Latin]].  Some of the Absurdists, such as [[Jean Genet]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Norrish. ''New tragedy and comedy in France, 1945–1970''.Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-389-20746-2}}. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tardieu]],&lt;ref name = Hardison438&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré, Margot Berthold.

Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-57429-3}}. pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  As the influence of the Absurdists grew, the style spread to other countries—with playwrights either directly influenced by Absurdists in Paris or playwrights labelled Absurdist by critics.

=== Legacy ===
Echoes of elements of "The Theatre of the Absurd" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more [[avant-garde]] or experimental playwrights like [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]—in ''[[The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World]]'' and ''[[The America Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Enoch Brater. "After the Absurd". ''Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama''. Ed. Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn.

In addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in [[Urdu literature]], ''Mazaron Ke Phool'' [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrish, pg. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt; According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Richardson 1154&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in ''[[Les Chaises|The Chairs]]'' "uber-marrionettes").&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&amp;issue=3|title=Open access journal for Film and Television Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are frequently stereotypical, [[archetype|archetypal]], or flat character types as in [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin.

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name ="Esslin402" /&gt;  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand.

Ohio State University Press, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt; – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''). In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''The Visit'' the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alan Crockett. ''Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt''.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57003-213-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-213-4}}. pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'', and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France''. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinocéros]]'', Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom. ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco''. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Heilman. ''The Ghost on the Ramparts''. University of Georgia Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8203-3265-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8203-3265-9}}. pg. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', for example, find themselves in a story (''[[Hamlet]]'') in which the outcome has already been written.&lt;ref name = Bradby59&gt;Bradby, ''Modern'' pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn. ''Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard''. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990
{{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87249-686-6}}. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt; or the two main characters in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' or Hamm and Clov in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's ''[[La Leçon|The Lesson]]''&lt;ref name = Hinden401&gt;Hinden, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; or in many of Albee's plays, ''[[The Zoo Story]]''&lt;ref name = Kane159&gt;Leslie Kane. ''The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8386-3187-8}}. pg. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. ''Edward Albee: A Casebook''. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. ''Conversations with Edward Albee''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87805-342-5}}. pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Tardieu]], for example, in the series of short pieces ''Theatre de Chambre'' arranged the language as one arranges music.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-Garde''. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette R. Malkin. ''Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-521-38335-8}}. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bald Soprano'', for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Segal. ''The Death of Comedy''. Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-01247-X}} pg. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the characters in ''The Bald Soprano''—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. ''Harold Pinter''. Routledge, 1983. {{ISBN|0-416-31710-3}}. pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in ''[[The Caretaker]]'' is typical of Pinter:

:ASTON. More or less exactly what you...
:DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (''Pause''.)
:ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Caretaker''. DPS, 1991.{{ISBN|0822201844}}, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.&lt;ref name="Kane159" /&gt;  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in ''Godot'' when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...&lt;ref&gt;David Bradby. ''Beckett, Waiting for Godot''. Camberidge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and [[non sequitur (humor)|non-sequiturs]]:

:GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas?
:STANLEY.  Nothing.
:GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays''. Grove Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8021-5114-0}}. pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. "''The Birthday Party'': Harold Pinter". ''Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter''. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87754-706-8}}. pg. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby. ''Drama, Metadrama and perception''. Associated University Presse, 1986 {{ISBN|0-8387-5101-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5101-5}}. pg. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionesco's ''The Lesson'', a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian
:PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian?
:PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''The Bald Soprano and Other Plays''. Grove Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8021-3079-8}}. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Schumacher. ''Encyclopedia of Literature &amp; Criticism''. 1990. Routledge. pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in ''Godot'' or ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Homan. ''Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance''. Bucknell University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8387-5064-8}}. pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in ''The Birthday Party'', for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 132, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In later Pinter plays, such as ''The Caretaker''&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 76–89&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Homecoming'',&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993.{{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'': Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen James Bottoms. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee''. Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83455-4}}. pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared.
:EDNA: We … were … terrified.
:HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee. ''A delicate balance: a play in three acts''. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-573-60792-3}}. pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:&lt;ref&gt;Les Essif. ''Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation''. Indiana University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-253-33847-6}}. pg. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in ''The Chairs'' an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Rayner. ''Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre''. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8166-4544-2}}. pg. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the action of ''Godot'' is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in ''[[Footfalls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. ''Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives''.Ohio State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8142-0334-5}}. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, or in ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'' only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}. pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Cohn. ''A Beckett Canon''. University of Michigan Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-472-11190-9}} pg. 298, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's ''[[Amédée ou comment s'en débarrasser|Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It]]'', a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''The Makers of Modern Culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in ''The Maids'', two maids pretend to be their mistress; in ''The Balcony'' brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'': it's a play about two minor characters in ''[[Hamlet]]''; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform ''The Mousetrap'', the play-within-the-play in ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Schlueter. ''Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama''. Columbia University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-231-04752-5}}. pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoppard's ''Travesties'', James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. W. Tan, Tom Stoppard. ''A stylistics of drama: with special focus on Stoppard's Travesties''. NUS Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9971-69-182-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-69-182-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots are frequently cyclical:&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt; for example, ''Endgame'' begins where the play ended&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''Myth and ritual in the plays of Samuel Beckett''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8386-3299-8}}. pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''.Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Karpati Kennedy|Andrew K. Kennedy]]. ''Samuel Beckett''. Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-27488-5}}. pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ticio Escobar''' is a [[Paraguay]]an lawyer, academic, author, museum director, and former Minister of Culture of Paraguay.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He has championed the rights of [[Indigenous peoples of Paraguay]], writing about and curating shows on the topic.

== Early life and education ==
Escobar was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Asunción]]. His father was jurist Jorge H. Escobar, and his mother is María Rosalba Argaña Ferraro.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He graduated in Law at the [[Universidad Católica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] in 1970. Five years later, in 1974, he obtained his [[Master's degree]] (''licencia'') here in [[Philosophy]]. During his study, he was a member of the Comisión de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en el Paraguay, a [[human rights]] group.&lt;ref name="docPCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/TICIO.doc biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/eng/index.htm ''Urban Heroes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Between 1971 and 1989, Escobar was a university professor in the fields of [[philosophy of law]], [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical anthropology]], [[history of art]] and [[art criticism]].&lt;ref name="AQE"&gt;A Quienes Elegimos, [http://www.aquieneselegimos.org.py/dat/679-cv1-1(ul).doc Curriculum Vitae] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1980, he was an art reviewer for the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo. In 1979 he founded the [[Museo del Barro]] (museum of pottery) in Asunción, with the objective to preserve Paraguayan culture. The same year he also founded the Museo de Arte Indígena, Centro de Artes Visuales (museum for indigenous art, center of visual art). To this museum, of which he was also the director until 2008, he donated his own art collection.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AQE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/344 profile]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and activism==
Between 1978 and 1988, Escobar was the curator for Paraguay at the Biennale of [[São Paulo]]. Furthermore, he was curator for several versions of the [[Venice Biennale]] and the biennales of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lima]] and [[Porto Alegre]], and for a number of expositions in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]].

The '''''Vues des ports de France''''' ("Scenes of the harbours of France") are a series of paintings by French painter [[Claude Joseph Vernet|Joseph Vernet]], made between 1754 and 1765 to answer a requirement by King [[Louis XV]]. Representing ten harbours, they were meant to document and promote commerce and naval service.

== History ==
In 1753, [[Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]] suggested to King Louis XV that Vernet realise a series of paintings documenting and exalting the harbours of France. The Crown ordered 24 paintings, each paid 6000 [[Livre tournois|Livres tournois]], with detailed specifications, such as the foreground representing the activities of the local industry.

Between 1753 and 1765, Vernet traveled to ten of the harbours ([[Marseille]], [[Bandol]], [[Toulon]], [[Antibes]], [[Sète]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Bayonne]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]] and [[Dieppe (Seine-Maritime)|Dieppe]]), and eventually completed 15 of the intended 24 views. The paintings were exposed at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon de peinture et de sculpture]], with long descriptions detailing their technical aspects.&lt;ref name="musee_marine" /&gt; From 1758, engraved reproductions of the paintings were made by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and [[Jacques-Philippe Le Bas]] and published; they proved popular and were reprinted several times.&lt;ref name="musee_marine"&gt;[http://www.musee-marine.fr/programmes_multimedia/vernet/Partie1/tableaux/tableaux.html L'Histoire des tableaux], [[Musée national de la Marine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The series consolidated Vernet's status as a marine painter, and from then on his paintings were highly priced, "worth their weigh in gold" according to [[Pierre-Jean Mariette]], with patrons such as [[Catherine II of Russia]].&lt;ref name="guichard"&gt;Charlotte Guichard, Pierre-Yves Beaurepaire (dir.) et Pierrick Pourchasse (dir.), « Les circulations artistiques en Europe (années 1680-années 1780) », dans Les circulations internationales en Europe, années 1680-années 1780, Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2010, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1791,  [[Jean-François Hue]], himself a student of Vernet's, was tasked to complete the series. Between 1792 and 1798, he completed six paintings reprensenting harbours of Bretagne, known as the ''[[Vues des ports de Bretagne]]''. In 1793, the ''Ports de France'' were amongst the first works exposed at the "Central Museum of Arts", which would become the [[Louvre Museum]].

In 1943, the [[Ministère de la Marine|State Secretary of the Navy]] requested that the paintings be attached to the [[Musée national de la Marine]]; thirteen of the paintings ended up transferring, while the last two remained at the Louvre. The paintings were all shown together in 1976.&lt;ref name="musee_marine" /&gt;

== Paintings ==
All of the paintings are oil on canvas, with the same dimensions of 165 by 263&amp;nbsp;cm.

'''''White House at Night''''' is an oil on canvas painting created on 16 June 1890 in the small town of [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]], six weeks before his death. It is displayed at the [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg.

According to the Hermitage Museum, the painting "expresses the great psychological tension under which Van Gogh found himself"; two of the windows, considered the "eyes" of a home, are rendered with "alarming" red splashes, while the star, a sign of fate, is seen as symbolic of van Gogh's anguish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthermitage.org/Vincent-van-Gogh/White-House-at-Night.html|title=White House at Night|publisher=Arthermitage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that van Gogh painted ''White House at Night'' around 8:00 PM due to the position of the "star" in the painting. Astronomers Donald Olson and Russell Doescher from the [[Texas State University-San Marcos]] calculated that the star in the painting must be Venus which was bright in the evening sky in June 1890.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1209614.stm|title= Venus pinpoints Van Gogh painting|date=8 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is the same one depicted in ''[[:File:Van Gogh - Blühende Kastanienbäume1.jpeg|Blossoming Chestnut Tree]]''.&lt;ref name="Heugten2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sjraar|first=|title=Vincent Van Gogh: Drawings : Van Gogh Museum|year=2007|publisher=Van Gogh Museum|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has a turbulent history. It was exhibited in Switzerland several times during the 1920s, but in the late 1920s disappeared into the private collection of German industrialist [[Otto Krebs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4034/fulltext.pdf|work=Sky and Telescope|author=Olson, Donald &amp; Doescher, Russell|title=Identifying the "star" in a long-lost van Gogh|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his acquisitions were of a style which was soon to be labelled "[[degenerate art]]" by the Nazis, which contributed towards the already publicity-shy Krebs keeping his collection secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/arts/hermitage-in-its-manner-displays-its-looted-art.html?pagewanted=all|title=Hermitage, in Its Manner, Displays Its Looted Art|work=New York Times|date=30 March 1995|first=Steven|last=Erlanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought to have been lost after [[World War II]], the painting languished in the Hermitage archives for fifty years before resurfacing in 1995 as part of an exhibition displaying artworks looted by the [[Soviets]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt; Three other van Gogh's from Kreb's collection were also shown: ''[[:File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Landscape_with_House_and_Ploughman.jpg|Landscape with House and Ploughman]]'', ''[[:File:Vincent van Gogh - Morning, going out to Work.jpg|Morning: Going out to Work (After Millet)]]'', and the ''[[:File:Vincent van Gogh - Portrait de Madame Trabuc.jpg|Portrait of Madame Trabuc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-antiques-design.com/art-theft/542-otto-krebs-collection|title=Otto Krebs Collection: Spoils of War or Plunder in Peace?| date= 20 September 2015|publisher=AAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Hooker''' (1779&amp;ndash;1832) was a [[Great Britain|British]] illustrator of [[natural history]].

Hooker studied under [[Franz Bauer]] (1758&amp;ndash;1840), becoming the official artist of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], whose publications he illustrated. He also worked on the "Oriental Memoirs" of [[James Forbes (botanist)|James Forbes]] and ''[[The Paradisus Londinensis]]'' with descriptions by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury]] (1761&amp;ndash;1829).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blunt|first1=Wilfrid|last2=Stearn|first2=William Thomas|authorlink2=William Thomas Stearn|year=1994|title=The Art of Botanical Illustration.

{{quote|William Hooker (no relation to Sir William) served as botanical artist to the Horticultural Society (now the Royal Horticultural Society) from 1812 until he retired in 1820.

The important place of '''women in dance''' can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the [[Middle Ages]], what has become known as [[ballet]] had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera]] produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of [[Romantic ballet]] in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of [[Marius Petipa]], appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's [[La Scala]] to the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of [[modern dance]] including [[flamenco]] and [[expressionist dance]].

==History==
Women have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into [[ballet]].

===Antiquity===
Cave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the [[Grotta dell'Addaura|Addauta Cave]] near [[Palermo]] and in the [[Roca dels Moros]] in [[Catalonia]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/music.htm|title=Egyptia Dance and Music|publisher=Kibbutz Reshafim|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt.

===China and Japan===
In China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as ''xi''.

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at [[folk dance|folk festivals]], particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the ''[[Carol (music)|carole]]'', and the ''tresque'' were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarotte.fr/?page_id=586|title=Danses médiévales et renaissance|publisher=La Marotte|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullally|first=Robert|title=The Carole: A Study of a Medieval Dance|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|publisher=Ashgate|year=2011|pages=41–50|isbn=978-1-4094-1248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the lively [[saltarello]] from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of [[courtesan]]s dressed as men performed the dance at [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s.&lt;ref name="Caroso1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroso|first=Fabritio|title=Courtly Dance of the Renaissance: A New Translation and Edition of the Nobiltà Di Dame (1600)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBwqMyKQvM4C&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28619-8|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of ballet==
In the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was [[Domenico da Piacenza]] (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: ''De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pnd/|title=De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi|publisher=pbm.com|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for [[Henry III of France]] at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for [[Louis XIII]], who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, which developed into today's [[Paris Opera Ballet]].&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer [[Jean Baptiste Lully]] and the French choreographer [[Pierre Beauchamp]], often assisted by [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html|title=History of Ballet|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as [[De Lafontaine|Mademoiselle De Lafontaine]] danced in Lully's ''Le Triomphe de l'amour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326306/La-Fontaine|title=La Fontaine
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100047735|title=Mlle de Lafontaine|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lafontaine was succeeded by [[Marie-Thérèse de Subligny]] who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with [[Claude Ballon]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100539716|title=Marie-Thérèse Subligny|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operabaroque.fr/Cadre_baroque.htm|title=Le Triomphe de l'amour|publisher=Le magazine de l'opéra baroque|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next leading dancer of the Opéra was [[Françoise Prévost]] (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475670/Francoise-Prevost|title=Françoise Prévost|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She persuaded conductor [[Jean-Féry Rebel]] to compose suites specifically for ballet. His ''Caprice'', ''Boutade'', ''Les Caractères de la danse'' and ''La Terpsichore'' brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in ''Caprice'' served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the ''Caractères'' into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, [[Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo|Marie Camargo]] (1710–1770) and [[Marie Sallé]] (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her ''Caractères'', each developing individual styles. They would take her place as [[prima ballerina]]s after she retired from the opera in 1730.&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Lynn|title=Women’s Work: Making Dance in Europe Before 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By5TNdV4dGUC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22530-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greskovic|first=Robert|title=Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2COs6yh_LS0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87910-325-5|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her [[entrechat|entrechat à quatre]]), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90467/Marie-Camargo|title=Marie Camargo|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines.&lt;ref name="Kassing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassing|first=Gayle|title=History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6035-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1700-1750.html|title=

Sallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining [[pantomime]] with dance in what became known as [[ballet d'action]]. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in ''Pygmalion'', a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders.&lt;ref name="Garfunkel2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfunkel|first=Trudy|title=On Wings of Joy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyTwwDm3YT4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2002|publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=978-0-7592-2862-7|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"/&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was [[Marie-Madeleine Guimard]] who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included [[Marie Allard]] (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by [[Gaétan Vestris]], becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1750-1830.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1750 à 1830|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=11 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic ballet==
The most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of [[Romantic ballet]]. The Italian-Swedish [[Marie Taglioni]] (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced ''[[La Sylphide]]'' in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's [[Mariinsky Ballet]] as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's [[en pointe]] (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian [[Fanny Elssler]] (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish [[cachucha]] in ''Le Diable boiteux'', performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Cerrito]], and [[Lucile Grahn]] in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ''[[Pas de Quatre]]''.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/romantic-ballet/|title=Romantic Ballet|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=16 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1830-1848.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1830 à 1848:La danse romantique|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=16 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the ''Pas de Quatre'' caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her ''[[Giselle]]'', while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of [[La Scala]] in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt;

Several notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born [[Virginia Zucchi]] (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in ''[[Coppélia]]'', ''[[La fille mal gardée]]'' and ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'', revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803133549548|title=Virginia Zucchi|publisher=Oxford Index|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierina Legnani]] (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[Raymonda]]'', gaining the title of [[prima ballerina assoluta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100058642|title=Pierina Legnani|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlotta Brianza]] (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at [[La Scala]] with which she toured the United States.

==20th-century ballet==
New, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/ART309940|title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Ballet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born [[Marie Rambert]] (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the [[Ballet Club]] (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as [[Frederick Ashton]]. Even more influential, [[Ninette de Valois]] (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's [[Vic-Wells Ballet]] in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where [[Alicia Markova]] (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later [[Margot Fonteyn]] (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/establishment-of-british-ballet/|title=The Establishment of British Ballet|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with [[Rudolf Nureyev]], first in ''[[Giselle]]'', until she retired in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nureyev.org/rudolf-nureyev-biography-margot-fonteyn/|title=Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, the perfect partnership|publisher=Rudolf Nureyev Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

As ballet developed in the United States, [[Maria Tallchief]] (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer [[Bronislava Nijinska]] (1891–1972) when she joined the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in [[George Balanchine]]'s arrangements for ''[[Song of Norway]]'' in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/dance/maria-tallchief-brilliant-ballerina-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Maria Tallchief, a Dazzling Ballerina and Muse for Balanchine, Dies at 88|author=Jack Anderson|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Chase]] (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/arts/dance-view-lucia-chase-helped-create-the-ballet-world-we-know.html|title=Dance View: Lucia Chase Helped Create the Ballet World we Know|author=Anna Kisselgoff|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 January 1986|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including [[Gelsey Kirkland]] (born 1952), who performed the leading role in ''[[The Firebird]]'' when she was just 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gelsey-kirkland-9365803#controversy-and-comeback&amp;awesm=~oCmUgMJASHMm00|title=Gelsey Kirkland|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suzanne Farrell]] (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/far0bio-1|title=Suzanne Farrell Biography|publisher=Academy of Achievement|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of dance==
[[File:Flamenco dancer 3467.jpg|thumb|200px|Flamenco dancer]]
Women have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular [[flamenco]], [[modern dance]], [[expressionist dance]], [[belly dance]] and [[cabaret]] which led to [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp|title=Dance Forms: An Introduction |publisher=ArtsAlive.ca|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamenco===
Flamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.org/es/flamenco/evolucion-etapa-hermetica-primeros-cantaores/|title=Flamenco: Evolución. Etapa Hermética. Primeros cantaores|publisher=Andalucía.org|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest was [[Juana la Macarrona]] (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer [[Silverio Franconetti]] but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyoflamenco.es/index.php/aula-flamenca/artistas/baile/509-la-macarrona|title=La Macarrona|publisher=Noticias y Ocio|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lola Flores]] (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, [[copla (music)|copla]] and [[chotis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.com/history/people/lolaflores.htm|title=Lola Flores|publisher=Andalucia.com|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelita Vargas]] (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsaraflamenco.fr/Angelita-Vargas.html?lang=fr|title=Angelita Vargas|publisher=Apsâra Flamenco|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dance===
Led by women, various styles of [[modern dance]] began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. [[Loie Fuller]] (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the [[Folies Bergères]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=168|title=Loie Fuller|publisher=Dance: National Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Greek art, [[Isadora Duncan]] (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/ArtsLetters/art_philosophy/Humanities/beginnings/beginnings_of_modern_dance.htm|title=The Beginnings of Modern Dance|publisher=Miami Dade College|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised on a farm in New Jersey, [[Ruth St. Denis]] (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/stdenis_essay_hecht.pdf|title=Ruth St. Denis (1879—1968): America's Divine Dancer |publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Martha Graham]] (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095902861|title=Martha Graham|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include [[Doris Humphrey]] (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and [[Helen Tamiris]] (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals.&lt;ref name="HendersonStacey2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Lol|last2=Stacey|first2=Lee|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8W2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92946-6|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tamiris-helen|title=Helen Tamaris|author=Pauline Tish|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born [[Hanya Holm]] (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/theater/hanya-holm-is-dead-at-99-influential-choreographer.html|title=Hanya Holm Is Dead at 99; Influential Choreographer|author=Jennifer Dunning|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 November 1992|accessdate=20 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Expressionist dance===
The German [[Mary Wigman]] is credited as the creator of [[expressionist dance]]. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre-dance.cahss.ualr.edu/waynesweb/Expressionism/ExpressionisticDance.htm|title=Expressionistic Dance: Mary Wigman|publisher=Twentieth Century Dance|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hertha Feist]] (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=fmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/feist2.htm|title=Feist|author=Frank-Manuel Peter|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also an associate of Wigman, [[Gret Palucca]] (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/archivbestand/darstellende-kunst/kuenstler/Gret_Palucca.htm|title=Gret Palucca|publisher=Akademie der Künste|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her students, [[Dore Hoyer]] (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the [[Second World War]] in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the [[Hamburg State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/hoyer.htm|title=Dore Hoyer (1911-1967)|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Belly dance===
While belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleenah.com/history.html|title=Bellydance Unveiled: A Brief History|publisher=Aleenah.com|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stars included [[Tahia Carioca]] (1919–1999), [[Samia Gamal]] (1924–1994) and [[Nelly Mazloum]] (1929–2003).&lt;ref name="Hammond2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06bOHRW7s8C&amp;pg=PA192|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-054-7|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including [[Dalilah (bellydancer)]] (1936–2001), Dahlena and [[Serena Wilson|Serena]] (1933–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellydance.org/articles/bellydance_history.html|title=Belly Dance History ~ An American Odessey: A History of Modern US Bellydance|author=Helen Waldie|publisher=IAMED|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabaret===
Women started to sing and dance in the cabarets of Paris in the 1890s, emphasizing the female body by introducing seductive movements highlighting their breasts and hips. Most of them had no formal training, the exception being [[Cléo de Mérode]] (1875–1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the [[Folies Bergère]].&lt;ref name=be&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1890-1914.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1890 à 1914: La Belle Epoque|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=21 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major choreographer was Algerian-born [[Mariquita (dancer)|Mariquita]] (1830–1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Bergère and the [[Opéra Comique]]. Stars of the period included the Spanish [[La Belle Otero]] from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] who gained fame at Charles Franconi's [[Cirque d'été]] in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-image.org/site/etude_comp/etude_comp_detail.php?i=1140|title=La Belle Otero, emblème de la Belle Époque|publisher=Histoire par l'image|accessdate=21 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilienne d’Alençon]] (1869–1946) who danced at the Folies Bergère, and Dutch-born [[Mata Hari]] (1876–1917) who from 1905 became famous for her Indonesian-inspired temple dance, first in Paris and then in other European capitals.&lt;ref name=be/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/mata-hari-9402348#exotic-dancer-and-mistress&amp;awesm=~oCbYeBl3Wuhvzz|title=Mata Hari: Spy, Dancer (1876–1917)|publisher=bio.|accessdate=22 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Goulue]] (1866–1929) is remembered for dancing the [[cancan]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1955|title=Weber Louise, dit La Goulue (1866-1929)|publisher=Amis et Passionnés du Père-Lachaise|accessdate=22 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
