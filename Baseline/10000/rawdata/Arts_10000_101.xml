'''''A Perfumed Scorpion'''''&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1978) A Perfumed Scorpion. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-86304-080-2}} (paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-fiction book by the [[Sufism|Sufist]] writer, [[Idries Shah]], that was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1978, the same year that he published two other major works: ''[[Learning How to Learn: Psychology and Spirituality in the Sufi Way]]'' and ''[[The Hundred Tales of Wisdom]]''.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''A Perfumed Scorpion'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref name="IAN"&gt;Shah, T. In Arabian Nights: A Caravan of Moroccan Dreams. New York, NY: Bantam. pp. 215–216. {{ISBN|0-553-80523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The book contains the substance of lectures given by the author at various universities in the United States under the aegis of the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]] and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].  The ‘perfuming of a scorpion’ is a reference to a symbol used by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Bahaudin Naqshband]] of Bukhara when he taught about the ubiquitous problem of hypocrisy and self-deception in both individuals and institutions: “Whoever might perfume a scorpion will not thereby escape its sting”.

The seven sections of the book deal in depth with this issue under headings such as Education, The Nature of Sufi Knowledge, The Path and the Duties and the Techniques, [[Teaching stories|Teaching Stories]], A framework for New Knowledge and Involvement in Sufi Study. Each section contains numerous illustrative anecdotes from contemporary life but is nevertheless rooted in the teaching patterns of [[Rumi]], [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Jami]], and other great Oriental sages who dealt with the need for, and the path to, knowledge and information before real progress can be made.

== Reception ==
''A Perfumed Scorpion'' was described by one reviewer as "... an invigorating and abrasive book, like jumping into icy water - hard to do, but you're glad you have done it." This reviewer also appreciated the way it dissolves in the attentive reader “the maiming effect of unconscious bias.”&lt;ref&gt;Books and Bookmen. May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the book continues and it has remained in print ever since it was published.

Philosopher of [[science]] and physicist [[Henri Bortoft]] used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Bortoft's ''[[The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science]]'' includes stories from ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', ''[[The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin]]'' and ''A Perfumed Scorpion''.

The '''Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles''' is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar]] frontal currently exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guia del Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.pàgina 20. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work dates from the second quarter of the 12th century and comes from a church of the [[Bishop]] of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] and was acquired in 1905. It is one of the masterpieces of the collection of panel painting of the MNAC. The frontal, the item covering the front of the altar, stands out for the quality of its bright colours and because it illustrates some of the characteristics of composition in Romanesque art, such as bilateral symmetry, abstraction of the background, with no reference to space or context, and the unnatural geometrical treatment of form to be observed in the folds of the clothing. It also shows certain conventions of representation, such as so-called hierarchical perspective, which
consists in representing the chief character in a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=9ba1ca9999917353f2a3de632ab4a30a7123d7e5bc3f07940be42bb77e37f6ab?inventoryNumber=015803-000&amp;lang=en The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Inauguració Sales romànic juny 2011 -Frontal Seu d'urgell 2.JPG|thumb|dreta|The Frontal exhibited at the Romanesque rooms of [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], in Barcelona.]]

The composition is presided by the ''[[Maiestas Domini]]'', or ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', represented in a double [[mandorla]], typical of earlier [[Carolingian art]]. According to the [[Bible]] sources inspiring the vision, the Lord's throne is the arc of Heaven and he has the Earth as his footstool. His face is framed by a cruciform halo and his expression is severe. He is holding the [[Book of Revelation]] in his left hand and blessing with his right. The [[Apostles]] figure in the lateral compartments, arranged in tiered pyramids, an original compositional formula, although it was already known in the art of the
Early Empire and also appears in the famous 11th-century Romanesque bibles of [[Rodes]] and [[Ripoll]].

The disciples are all addressing the Saviour, either with their eyes or with the inclination of their heads, and are carrying books or scrolls. [[St Peter]], furthermore, is holding the keys. Opposite him, on the other side, is [[St Paul]], with his characteristic bald head. Both the image of Christ and the quality of the yellow and red used and even the bordering on the frame are very similar to those on the [[Altar frontal from Sant Martí d'Ix|frontal from Sant Martí d’Ix]],&lt;ref&gt;(MNAC/MAC 15802)&lt;/ref&gt; which probably came from the same workshop.

This frontal was painted in [[tempera]] on a [[pine]] panel. It is one of the most characteristic representations of [[Catalan Romanesque]], showing Romanesque stylistic principles, such as bilateral symmetry and hierarchical geometric forms, as seen in the folds of the clothing. It is also noteworthy for the quality of the [[polychromy]]. The work shows similarities, especially with regard to colors and borders, to the frontal of [[Saint Martin of Ix]], indicating that probably they are from the same author or workshop.

The '''''Amaruśataka''''' or '''''Amarukaśataka''''' (अमरुशतक,  "the hundred stanzas of Amaru"), authored by '''Amaru''' (also Amaruka), is a collection of poems dated to about the 7th&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|2005}}, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; or 8th century.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

The ''Amaruśataka'' ranks as one of the finest [[lyrical poetry]] in the annals of [[Sanskrit literature]], ranking with [[Kalidasa]] and  {{IAST|[[Bhartṛhari]]}}'s ''{{IAST|Śṛngâraśataka}}''. The ninth-century literary critic [[Anandavardhana]] declared in his ''Dhvanyaloka'' that "a single stanza of the poet Amaru ... may provide the taste of love equal to what's found in whole volumes." Its verses have been used by poets and critics as examples and standards to judge other poems by. [[Andrew Schelling]] describes it as "love poetry original and vivid as that produced anywhere on the planet".&lt;ref name=schelling&gt;{{Harvnb|Schelling|2004}}, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Its subject is mostly [[Sringara]] (erotic love, romantic love) including aspects such as love, passion, estrangement, longing, rapprochement, joy and sorrow, etc. Greg Bailey notes that it is "as much about the social aspects of courting, betrayal, feminine indignance and masculine self-pity as it is about sensuality".&lt;ref name=bailey/&gt; Similarly, Schelling notes: "All the flavours or nuances of love are said to lie within the book, though you'll notice that the emphasis falls more on the bitter taste of separation or betrayal than on the sweetness of consummation."&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

==Authorship==
Not much is known about the life of Amaru. Traditional accounts attribute the work to King Amaru of Kashmir. The collection in its present form may well represent the work of more than one author—the poems that form part of the collection differ quite significantly across its different regional recensions.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Siegfried Lienhard]], only around half the verses in the Amarusataka are common across its various regional versions.  {{Harvnb|Lienhard|1984|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of legends associating the collection with the philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. One version occurs in his 14th century biography written by a follower, the ''Shankara-digvijaya''. According to this version, during [[Adi Shankara#Meeting with Mandana Mishra|his debate]] with [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], he was asked philosophical questions phrased in metaphors of love by the latter's wife, Ubhaya Bharati. Being celibate and therefore ignorant of the ''kama shastras'', Shankara requested an adjournment. He then entered the recently dead body of Amaru and spent a hundred days mastering the art of erotic love, before returning to defeat his opponent. He wrote the Amarushataka to memorialise his learning.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

Another version, given in Ravichandra's commentary on the Amarushataka, states that Shankara composed these poems to impart spiritual insight to the epicurean king Amaru, in metaphors he might understand. When this was misunderstood and mocked by the advisers at the court, Shankara entered the body of Amaru and provided a spiritual exegesis of the poems.&lt;ref name=schelling/&gt;

Accordingly, several manuscripts add [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s naming Shankara as the true author of the work, and Ravichandra, a mediaeval commentator on the Bengal recension of the Amarusataka, read metaphysical meanings into the verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lienhard|1984|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legends also state that  Amaru was the 101st reincarnation of a soul that had previously occupied 100 women.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14662">&lt;!--This article deals with the biga as an aspect of Roman culture and cultures that are closely related; it is not about all "two-horse chariots", which is why it's named the Latin "Biga" and not "two-horse chariot"--&gt;
[[File:Bige Musée de Laon 050208.jpg|thumb|Bronze figurine of a ''biga'' from [[Roman Gaul]]; the chariot itself is missing the breastwork]]
The '''''biga''''' ([[Latin]], plural ''bigae'') is the two-horse [[chariot]] as used in [[ancient Rome]] for sport, transportation, and ceremonies. Other animals may replace horses in art and occasionally for actual ceremonies. The term ''biga'' is also used by modern scholars for the similar chariots of other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures, particularly the two-horse chariot of the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Celts]]. The driver of a ''biga'' is a ''bigarius''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.10078 and 6.37836. The general term for chariot driver is ''auriga''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Latin words that distinguish chariots by the number of animals yoked as a team are ''[[quadriga]]'', a four-horse chariot used for racing and associated with the [[Roman triumph]]; ''triga'', or three-horse chariot, probably driven for ceremonies more often than racing (see [[Trigarium]]); and ''seiugis'' or ''seiuga'', the six-horse chariot, more rarely raced and requiring a high degree of skill from the driver. The ''biga'' and ''quadriga'' are the most common types.

Two-horse chariots are a common [[Roman currency|icon on Roman coins]]; see ''[[bigatus]]'', a type of [[denarius]] so called because it depicted a ''biga''.&lt;ref&gt;This is disputed.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[iconography]] of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion]] and [[cosmology]], the ''biga'' represents the moon, as the ''quadriga'' does the sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doro Levi]], "Aion," ''Hesperia'' 13.4 (1944), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek and Indo-European background==
{{See also|Chariot|Chariot racing}}
[[File:Loutrophoros Analatos Louvre CA2985.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of two-horses chariots on a ''[[loutrophoros]]'', c. 690 BC]]

The earliest reference to a chariot race in [[Western literature]] is an event in the [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] of [[Patroclus]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In Homeric warfare, elite warriors were transported to the battlefield in two-horse chariots, but fought on foot; the chariot was then used for pursuit or flight.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Kyle, ''Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient World'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Bronze Age]] chariots uncovered by archaeology in [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesian Greece]] are ''bigae''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Aiken Littauer, "The Military Use of the Chariot in the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age," in ''Selected Writings on Chariots, Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness'' (Brill, 2002), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date at which chariot races were introduced at the [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympian Games]] is recorded by later sources as 680 BC, when ''quadrigae'' competed. Races on horseback were added in 648. At Athens, two-horse chariot races were a part of athletic competitions from the 560s onward, but were still not a part of the Olympian Games.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, ''Sport and Spectacle in the Ancient World'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bigae'' drawn by mules competed in the 70th Olympiad (500 BC), but they were no longer part of the games after the 84th Olympiad (444 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Plummer, ''Athletics and Games of the Ancient Greeks'' (Cambridge, Mass., 1898), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 408 BC did ''bigae'' races begin to be featured at Olympia.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In myth, the ''biga'' often functions [[structuralism|structurally]] to create a complementary pair or to link opposites. The chariot of [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (16.152) was drawn by two immortal horses and a third who was mortal; at 23.295, a mare is yoked with a stallion. The team of [[Adrastos]] included the immortal "superhorse" [[Arion (mythology)|Areion]] and the mortal Kairos.&lt;ref&gt;Antimachus apud Pausanias 8.25.9. A psychoanalytic discussion of this yoking is given by [[George Devereux]], ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy: An Ethno-Psycho-Analytical Study'' (University of California Press, 1976), p. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SD8AaffTDlUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22October+equus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22October%20equus%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; A yoke of two horses is associated with the Indo-European concept of the Heavenly Twins, one of whom is mortal, represented among the Greeks by [[Castor and Pollux]], the Dioscuri, who were known for horsemanship.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Drews]], ''The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East'' (Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Bigae'' at the races==
[[File:Pannelli di giunio basso 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman consul|consul]] advances in his ''biga'' at the ''[[pompa circensis]]''&lt;ref&gt;As identified by Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, "The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 86.1 (1982), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(4th century, [[opus sectile]] from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]])'']]

Horse- and [[chariot racing|chariot-races]] were part of the ''[[ludi]]'', sacred games held during [[Roman festivals|Roman religious festivals]], from [[Kingdom of Rome|Archaic times]]. A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] who presented games was entitled to ride in a ''biga''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bernstein, "Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 224. For an example as recorded in an inscription, see ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 10.7295 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 5055.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacral meaning of the races, though diminished over time,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 262. The [[Church Fathers]] recognized the religious significance of ''ludi'', including both sporting events and theater, and therefore instructed Christians not to participate; see, for instance, [[Tertullian]], ''De spectaculis''.&lt;/ref&gt; was preserved by iconography in the [[Circus Maximus]], Rome's main racetrack.

Inscriptions referring to the ''bigarius'' as young&lt;ref&gt;''Puerilis'' in ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.100078 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 9348; ''infans'' in ''ILS'' 5300.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that a racing driver had to gain experience with a two-horse team before graduating to a ''quadriga''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Thuillier, "Le cirrus et la barbe. Questions d'iconographie athlétique romaine," ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]], Antiquité'' 110.1 (1998), p. 377, noting that the "major and minor" races held for the [[Robigalia]] may be junior and senior divisions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

A main source for the construction of racing ''bigae'' is a number of bronze figurines found throughout the Roman Empire, a particularly detailed example of which is held by the [[British Museum]]. Other sources are [[relief]]s and [[mosaic]]s. These show a lightweight frame, to which a minimal shell of fabric or leather was lashed. The [[center of gravity]] was low, and the wheels were relatively small, around 65&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter in proportion to a body 60&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 55&amp;nbsp;cm deep, with a breastwork of about 70&amp;nbsp;cm in height. The wheels may have been rimmed with iron, but otherwise metal fittings are kept to a minimum. The design facilitated speed, maneuverability and stability.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Junkelmann, "On the Starting Line with Ben Hur: Chariot-Racing in the Circus Maximus," in ''Gladiators and Caesars'' (University of California Press, 2000), pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Picswiss JU-17-31.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reenactment of a ''biga'' race]]

The weight of the vehicle has been estimated at 25–30&amp;nbsp;kg, with a maximum manned weight of 100&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Junkelmann, "On the Starting Line with Ben Hur," pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''biga'' is typically built with a single draught pole for a double yoke, while two poles are used for a ''quadriga''.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Crouwell, "Chariots in Iron Age Cyprus," in ''Selected Writings on Chariots, Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness'' (Brill, 2002), p. 153ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot for a two-horse racing team is not thought to differ otherwise from that drawn by a four-horse team, and so the horses of a ''biga'' pulled 50&amp;nbsp;kg each, while those of the ''quadriga'' pulled 25&amp;nbsp;kg each.&lt;ref&gt;Junkelmann, "On the Starting Line with Ben Hur,", pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The models or statuettes of ''bigae'' were [[art object]]s, [[toy]]s, or [[Collectable|collector's items]]. They are perhaps comparable to the modern [[hobby]] of [[Rail transport modelling|model trains]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Suetonius]] records that "At the beginning of his reign [Nero] used to play every day with ivory chariots on a board" ''(Sed cum inter initia imperii eburneis quadrigis cotidie in abaco luderet)''. Play ''in abaco'' ("on a gameboard") may imply a strategic game with rules; for other Roman board games see ''[[ludus duodecim scriptorum]]'' and ''[[ludus latrunculorum]]''. The ivory ''quadrigae'' may have been actual miniatures, or game pieces that represented the chariots. See Junkelmann, "On the Starting Line," p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological and ceremonial use==
[[File:Greek - Hydria with the Fight of Achilles and Memnon - Walters 482230.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''bigae'' of [[Achilles]] and [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], each drawn by one white horse and one black horse (''[[hydria]]'', 575–550 BC)]]

In his ''[[Etymologies]]'', [[Isidore of Seville]] explains the cosmic symbolism of chariot racing, and notes that while the ''[[quadriga]]'', or four-horse chariot, represents the sun and its course through the four seasons, the ''biga'' represents the moon, "because it travels on a twin course with the sun, or because it is visible both by day and by night — for they yoke together one black horse and one white."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologies'' 18.26, as translated by Stephen A. Barney ''et al.'', ''The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 368 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=biga+chariot+isidore+OR+isidorus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ptkoTILdBZH7nAfw8tGoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Chariots frequently appear in Roman art as allegories of the Sun and Moon, particularly in [[relief]]s and [[mosaic]]s, in contexts that are readily distinguishable from depictions of real-world charioteers in the circus.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, "The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments," p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luna in her ''biga'' drawn by horses or oxen was an element of [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraic]] iconography, usually in the context of the [[tauroctony]]. In the [[mithraeum]] of S. Maria Capua Vetere, a wall painting that uniquely focuses on Luna alone shows one of the horses of the team as light in color, with the other a dark brown. It has been suggested that the duality of the horses drawing a ''biga'' can also represent [[Plato]]'s [[metaphor]] of the charioteer who must control a soul divided by ''genesis'' and ''apogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Vermaseren, ''Mithraica I: The Mithraeum at S. Maria Capua Vetere'' (Brill, 1971), pp–15. 14; Plato, ''Phaedrus'' 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek art|Greek]] and [[Roman art]] depicts deities driving two-yoke chariots drawn by a number of animals. A ''biga'' of oxen was driven by [[Hecate]], the [[chthonic]] aspect of the Triple Goddess in complement with the "horned" or crescent-crowned [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Luna (Roman goddess)|Luna]], to whom the ''biga'' was sacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prudentius]], ''Contra Symmachum'' 733 (Migne); [[Friedrich Solmsen]], "The Powers of Darkness in Prudentius' ''Contra Symmachum'': A Study of His Poetic Imagination," ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 19.4 (1965), p. 248. See [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.118 on the identification of Hecate ''trimorphos'' with Luna, Diana, and [[Proserpina]]. According to [[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' 413f., Hecate originally had power over the heavens, land, and sea, not heaven, earth, and underworld.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Triptolemus]] is depicted on Roman coins as driving a serpent-drawn biga as he sows grain in response to [[Demeter|Demeter's]] appeal to him to teach mankind the skill of agriculture, such as on an Alexandrine [[drachma]], [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=3201&amp;pos=39 see ] .

The Birmingham engravers enabled the expansion of the scope of illustrated books and magazines to include the works of artists such as [[J. M. W. Turner]], greatly increasing the exposure of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Hartnell" /&gt;

==Members==
The existence of the Birmingham School as a distinctive group within the wider field of engraving was first recognised with the ''Exhibition of Engravings by Birmingham Men'' held at the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]] in 1877. This exhibition featured work by the following engravers:&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hill|first=Joseph|year=1907|title=The book makers of old Birmingham; authors, printers, and book sellers|publication-place=Birmingham|publisher=Printed at the Shakespeare Press for Cornish Bros.|pages=6–7|oclc=3773421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

=== (2008–2010) ===
Electrowavez is a [[Duet|duo]] of [[music]] producers, consisting of brothers Charlie Shaabi and Richard Savo from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. They began their [[electronic music]] career in 2008. Electrowavez' first appearance was on February 2009 with the release of "Kano Ya Habibi", an electro remix of the [[wikt:Lebanese|Lebanese]] singer [[Fairuz]]. The release reached the top chart position on Arabil, a local radio station. Electrowavez's  [[electro house]] second single, "Give Me My Freedom", was officially released by Soul Shift Music in September 2009. The duo used a short sample of [[Oum Kalthoum]]- "[[:fr:Al Atlal|Al Atlal]]", an Arabic [[poem]] that reflects one of the major themes of Arabic [[poetry]].

=== ''Brainstorm'' (2010–2012) ===
In May 2010, Electrowavez released their debut album, "''Brainstorm''". Eleven tracks were composed and written over the course of two years, combining [[electro (music)|electro]] [[house music]] genre with Arabic instrumentation and melodies. A collaboration between Richard Savo &amp; Angelina Zbedat, "''Sababa''" was the first single released on May 2010, and it peaked at the number 1 position on the chart on the Israeli radio station Arbil-an. "''Sababa''"’s first TV appearance was on the Israeli [[TV]] show "Haravak", an adaptation of ([[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)|The Bachelor]])&lt;ref&gt;[[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)|The Bachelor]], [http://haravak2.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=695245 ElectrowaveZ's on Israeli TV Show],  retrieved 03-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; on July 2013. In September 2010, Electrowavez released "''[http://www.almadar.co.il/news.aspx?cid=58&amp;aid=14968 Barcode]''" with featured guest vocalist Walid el Hilou. The release was a number one hit for three weeks in a row. Angelina Zbedat performed solo vocals on the single "''My Life''", released on January 2011.

=== ''Dubooster'' (2012) ===

Electrowavez released their "Dubooster" EP on March 2012, intended as a five track [[dubstep]] [[side project]]. All five tracks are listed in [http://www.milesofmusik.com/music-catalog Miles of Musik catalogue].&lt;ref&gt;MOM (Music catalogue), [http://www.milesofmusik.com/search-results?keywords=electrowavez&amp;op=Search Electrowavez on Miles of Musik catalogue], retrieved 25-03-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Za3tar'' (2013) ===

The band's 2013 album, "''Za3tar''", was released on 3 July 2013. It features tracks influenced by [[psychedelic trance]], [[Goa trance]] and [[dubstep]] genres. Notably, this album contains heavily influences from the psytrance subgenre and has different [[rhythm]] combinations. The success of the album conceded with the growing popularity of the psychedelic music scene among the [[Arab]] [[community]] in [[Israel]]. The album was entitled "''Za3tar''" or "[[Za'atar]]" after a popular Middle Eastern herb that carries many benefits.

[[Yasushi Akutagawa]]'s '''''Ellora Symphony''''' was composed in 1958 after a visit to the [[Ellora Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[India]]. One of several [[Japan]]ese [[Primitivism|primitivistic]] [[Symphony|symphonies]] composed in the 1950s, including [[Akira Ifukube]]'s [[Sinfonia Tapkaara]] and [[Kan Ishii]]'s [[Sinfonia Ainu]], it is representative of Akutagawa's most adventurous period, when he associated [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] and embraced [[avant-garde music]].

Instead of the traditional multi-movement layout, which Akutagawa had used in his [[Shostakovich]]ian [[Symphony No. 1 (Akutagawa)|Prima Sinfonia]] three years earlier, the Ellora Symphony is structured in fifteen sequences: eight caressing "feminine" fragments marked [[Tempo|Adagio]] or [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] and seven aggressive "masculine" ones marked [[Tempo|Allegro]]. The later assemble mainly in the last half of the work, translating in an Introduction and Allegro-like form.

The '''European Prize for Architecture''' is an architecture prize awarded annually by the [[European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies]] and [[Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture]]. It was established by [[Christian Narkiewicz-Laine]], the Finnish-Lithuanian-American architect, design critic, artist, poet, and museum chief of The [[Chicago Athenaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanarch.eu/european-prize-for-architecture-nominations/|title=The European Centre|website=Europeanarch.eu|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
“The Prize, according to Narkiewicz-Laine, “was established to continue and celebrate Europe’s ongoing contribution to world history and culture and to encourage our present generation of practitioners to embrace the true art of architecture together with its humanistic and social pursuits in order to make our European cities and nations true centers of advanced culture and civilization."
“Throughout the centuries, Mr. Narkiewicz-Laine adds, “Europe has given the world its most important practitioners from Phidias, Vitriuvius, Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Palladio to the early modern masters, Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Walter Gropius, and Eliel and Eero Saarinen. Those architects have developed numerous philosophies and visionary approaches to building, engineering, and planning that have grown from the need to invent or express a time and place in Europe’s rich history. Classicism, Byzantine, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Beaux-Arts, Constructivism, Art Deco, DeStijl, and Modernism have all resulted as an expression of clearly stated European values and ideals and have given form and shape to the most famous cities in the world.”

'''Frances Anne Edgeworth''' (née Beaufort) (1769–1865), known as '''Fanny''', was an Irish botanical artist and memoirist. She was the stepmother and confidant of the author [[Maria Edgeworth]].&lt;ref name=Loeber&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loeber|first1=Rolf|last2=Loeber|first2=Magda|last3=Mullin Burnham|first3=Anne|title=EDGEWORTH, Mrs Frances (Fanny) Anne|url=http://www.lgif.ie/authorDetails.action;jsessionid=913A146D655DFC45135A038A6F87AF0E?authorId=702|website=An Electronic Version of A Guide to Irish Fiction 1650 – 1900|publisher=An Foras Feasa, NUI Maynooth|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Ray|title=Dictionary of British And Irish Botantists And Horticulturalists Including plant collectors, flower painters and garden designers|date=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=9780850668438|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Frances Anne Beaufort was born at ''Flower Hill'' in Navan, County Meath, in 1769.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of four children of [[Daniel Augustus Beaufort]] and Mary Beaufort (née Waller). Her brother was Admiral [[Francis Beaufort]], and her sisters were the writers [[Harriet Henrietta Beaufort|Harriet]] and Louisa. She was educated at Mrs Terson's School at [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]], learning writing, drawing, dancing and French. She studied art further under the English artist Bowring, Dublin-based Francis Robert West, and Raymond Deshouilleres of London.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; In 1788, she accompanied her father on a tour of Ireland, recording archaeological sites and objects. The family lived in London from 1789 to 1790.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt;

==Later life==
On 31 May 1798, she married [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], becoming his fourth wife and stepmother of Maria Edgeworth and her 11 siblings. Edgeworth and Maria, who was a year older than her stepmother, would become close to Maria, describing her as "her beloved friend and mother".&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; There is evidence that Edgeworth was a writer like her sisters and stepdaughter, but her work was largely overlooked. A visitor to [[Edgeworthstown]] in 1813, James Hall, makes reference to her as a "successful" author, with a published novel, ''What You Choose to Call it'' or ''The Good Wife''. This attribution was repeated in 1884, but is not mentioned by the family or their papers. It is known that Edgeworth wrote a memoir of Maria Edgeworth, containing selected letters. Some of Edgeworth's letters are held by the [[National Library of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt; and in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue of the papers of Maria Edgeworth (1768–1849), and the Edgeworth family, 17th–19th century|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/edgeworth/edgeworth.html#edgeworth.A.1|website=University of Oxford, Bodleian Library|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edgeworths went on to have six children together: Frances Maria Edgeworth (1799 – 4 February 1848), Harriet Edgeworth (1801–1889), Sophia Edgeworth (1803–1836), Lucy Jane Edgeworth (1805–1897), Francis Beaufort Edgeworth (1809–1846), and [[Michael Pakenham Edgeworth]] (24 May 1812 – 1881).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frances Ann Beaufort|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p17345.htm#i173444|website=The Peerage|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Jean E.|last2=Schroeder-Lein|first2=Glenna R.|title=Ways of Wisdom: Moral Education in the Early National Period|date=2001|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Georgia|isbn=9780820322520|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWilliams|first1=Brendan|title=Illustrious family came from a faulty line|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/illustrious-family-came-from-a-faulty-line-1.1118696|accessdate=10 July 2015|agency=The Irish Times|date=30 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edgeworth died on 10 February 1865 at Edgeworthstown, County Longford.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; Amongst her grandchildren is the philosopher and political economist, [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbe|first1=Lluis|title=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth: A Portrait with Family and Friends|date=2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham|isbn=9781849803229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work==
Edgeworth was a contemporary of other botanical women artists of the time, such as [[Mary Delaney]].&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Theresa M.|title=Clandestine Marriage: Botany and Romantic Culture|date=2012|publisher=JHU Press|location=Maryland|isbn=9781421405179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's biographer, Ellison, describes her as "an exceptionally talented artist in oils and crayons", though Edgeworth also worked in watercolour. She illustrated her father's 1792 ''A New Map of Ireland''.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt;

After her marriage, Edgeworth helped in the illustration of her husband's engineering projects. She produced illustrations for Maria Edgeworth's ''The Parent's Assistant'', which were used in the third edition. It was the production of these drawings that led to Richard Lovell Edgeworth and Frances meeting and subsequently marrying.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The private collection at Edgeworthstown House holds an album containing some of these drawings. The [[Huntington Library]] in California has a volume of her botanical watercolours of plants from her home and around Ireland, dating from 1798 to 1807.&lt;ref name=Loeber /&gt; These botanical paintings are of well-known plants from her home and surroundings and consist of 101 drawings. The drawings are very detailed and show a keen interest in botany. Edgeworth includes the Linnaean names, with her primary interest being in a complex group of plants, the [[Cryptogam]]s.&lt;ref name=Kelley /&gt;

A '''Gesamtkunstwerk''' ({{IPA-de|gəˈzamtˌkʊnstvɛʁk|lang}}, translated as "total work of  art",&lt;ref&gt;Millington ([[Wikt:n.d.|n.d.]]), Warrack (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; "ideal work of art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Gesamtkunstwerk''&lt;/ref&gt; "universal artwork",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html#anchor1538384 ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814172155/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html |date=2016-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "synthesis of the arts", "comprehensive artwork", "all-embracing art form" or "total artwork") is a work of art that makes use of all or many [[The arts|art forms]] or strives to do so. The term is a [[German language|German]] word which has come to be accepted in [[English language|English]] as a term in [[aesthetics]].

The term was first used by the German writer and [[philosopher]] [[Karl Friedrich Eusebius Trahndorff|K. F. E. Trahndorff]] in an essay in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Trahndorff (1827), ''Ästhetik oder Lehre von Weltanschauung und Kunst''&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[opera]] composer [[Richard Wagner]] used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/richard-wagners-concept-of-the-gesamtkunstwerk/|title=Richard Wagner's Concept of the ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’|website=Interlude.hk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.

In the twentieth century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others have applied it to film and mass media.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;For discussions of architecture as Gesamtkunstwerk, see the relevant section of this article. For discussions of film and mass media, see for instance Matthew Wilson Smith, ''The Total Work of Art: From Bayreuth to Cyberspace.'' New York: Routledge, 2007; Carolyn Birdsall, ''Nazi Soundscapes: Sound, Technology, and Urban Space in Germany, 1933–1945.'' Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2012. pp. 141–72; and Jeongwon Joe, "Introduction: Why Wagner and Cinema? Tolkien Was Wrong." In ''Wagner and Cinema,'' edited by Jeongwon Joe and Sander L. Gilman, 1–26. Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before Wagner==
Some elements of opera reform, seeking a more "classical" formula, had begun at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of [[opera seria]], and the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a movement began to advance the [[Libretto|librettist]] and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, "reform opera" is primarily associated with [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]]. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck's collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of [[Carl Maria von Weber]], until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian ''[[bel canto]]'' tradition and the [[French opera|French]] "spectacle opera", developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.

However these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art; Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, wished to consolidate his view, originally, as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others who had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German [[Romanticism|Romantics]], as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff's essay, in which the word first occurred, "Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art". Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included [[Gottfried Lessing]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s enthusiastic review of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]'s opera ''[[Undine (Hoffmann)|Undine]]'' (1816) admired it  as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=Oliver|title=Source Readings in Music History: The Romantic Era|year=1965|place=New York|pages=63|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502044016/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|archivedate=2005-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagner's ideas==
Wagner used the exact term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (which he spelt 'Gesammtkunstwerk') on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays "[[Art and Revolution]]" and "[[The Artwork of the Future]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), p. 35, where the word is translated as 'great united work'; p. 52 where it is translated as 'great unitarian Art-work'; and p. 88 (twice) where it is translated as 'great united Art-work'.&lt;/ref&gt; where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack (n.d.), ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' is incorrect in saying that Wagner used the word only in "The Artwork of the Future"&lt;/ref&gt; He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as 'the consummate artwork of the future' and 'the integrated drama', and frequently referred to 'Gesamtkunst'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend, though abstracted from its nationalist particulars to a universal humanist fable.

Wagner felt that the Greek tragedies of [[Aeschylus]] had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by [[Euripides]]. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such "monstrosities" as [[Grand Opera]]. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In "Art and Revolution" Wagner applies the term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in the context of Greek tragedy. In "The Art-Work of the Future" he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealised, ideal.

In his extensive book ''[[Opera and Drama]]'' (completed in 1851) he takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called ''music drama'' despite Wagner's disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.

Wagner's own opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and specifically its components ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realising these ideals;&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 86&lt;/ref&gt; he was himself after this stage to relax his own [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] and write more 'operatically'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==In architecture==
Some architectural writers have used the term ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building's totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Vidalis, "Gesamtkunstwerk – 'total work of art'", ''Architectural Review'', June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make a claim for when the notion of the ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' was first employed from the point of view of a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as [[Michelangelo]] saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering. 
It has been argued by historian  Robert L. Delevoy that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk''. But it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Delevoy, 'Art Nouveau', in ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb| [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: Interior of the Robie House, Chicago, 1909.]]

However evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' can be seen some time before the 1890s. There was an increasing trend amongst architects in the 18th and 19th centuries to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure they tried to extend their role to include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work as well. This included not only the interior architectural features but was extended to the design&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwerk.westbankcorp.com/|title=Home - GESAMTKUNSTWERK|website=GESAMTKUNSTWERK|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures and door-handles. [[Robert Adam]] and [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] are examples of this trend to create an over-all harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china and glassware.
 
A distinctly modern approach to the concept of architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' emerged with the [[Bauhaus]] school, first established in [[Weimar]] in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]]. The school specialised in design, art and craftsmanship (architecture was not introduced as a separate course until 1927 after it had transferred to [[Dessau]]). Gropius contended that artists and architects should also be craftsmen, that they should have experience working with different materials and artistic mediums, including industrial design, clothes design and theatre and music. However, Gropius did not necessarily see a building and every aspect of its design as being the work of a single hand.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wittick, ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sadi in a Rose garden.jpg|thumb|Saadi in a Rose garden, from a [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] manuscript of the Gulistan, ca. 1645.]]
The '''''Gulistan''''' ({{lang-fa|گلستان}}, also transliterated as ''Golestan''&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; "The Rose Garden") is a landmark of [[Persian literature]], perhaps its single most influential work of prose.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Franklin |title=GOLESTĀN-E SAʿDI|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/golestan-e-sadi|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=15 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1258 [[Common Era|CE]], it is one of two major works of the Persian poet [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], considered one of the greatest medieval Persian   poets.  It is also one of his most popular books, and has proved deeply influential in the West as well as the East.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/gulistan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulistan is a collection of poems and stories, just as a rose-garden is a collection of roses.  It is widely quoted as a source of wisdom. The well-known aphorism still frequently repeated in the western world, about being sad because one has no shoes until one meets the man who has no feet "whereupon I thanked Providence for its bounty to myself" is from the Gulistan.&lt;ref&gt;[Durant, The Age of Faith, 326]&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimalist plots of the Gulistan's stories are expressed with precise language and psychological insight, creating a "poetry of ideas" with the concision of mathematical formulas.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; The book explores virtually every major issue faced by humankind, with both an optimistic and a subtly satirical tone.&lt;ref name=katouzian&gt;{{cite book|last=Katouzian|first=Homa|title=Sa‘di, The Poet of Life, Love and Compassion|year=2006|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-85168-473-1|url=http://sufibooks.info/Sufism/Sadi-The-Poet-of-Life-Love-and-Compassion-Homa-Katouzian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much advice for rulers, in this way coming within the [[mirror for princes]] genre. But as Eastwick comments in his introduction to the work,&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; there is a common saying in Persian, "Each word of Sa'di has seventy-two meanings", and the stories, alongside their entertainment value and practical and moral dimension, frequently focus on the conduct of [[dervishes]] and are said to contain [[sufi]] teachings.

==Reasons for composition==
[[File:The poet Sa'di converses by night with a young friend in a garden. Miniature from Gulistan Sa'di. Herat, 1427. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. f.3r.jpg|thumb|The poet Sa'di converses by night with a young friend in a garden. Miniature from Gulistan. Herat, 1427. [[Chester Beatty Library]], Dublin; workshops of [[Baysonqor]].]]
In his introduction Sa'di describes how a friend persuaded him to go out to a garden on 21&amp;nbsp;April 1258. There the friend gathered up flowers to take back to town. Sa'di remarked on how quickly the flowers would die, and proposed a flower garden that would last much longer:

:::''Of what use will be a dish of roses to thee?''
:::''Take a leaf from my rose-garden.''
:::''A flower endures but five or six days''
:::''But this rose-garden is always delightful.''

Sa'di continues, "On the same day I happened to write two chapters, namely on polite society and the rules of conversation, in a style acceptable to orators and instructive to letter-writers.".&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt&lt;/ref&gt; In finishing the book, Sa'di writes that, though his speech is entertaining and amusing, "it is not hidden from the enlightened minds of ''sahibdils'' (possessors of heart), who are primarily addressed here, that pearls of healing counsel have been drawn onto strings of expression, and the bitter medicine of advice has been mixed with the honey of wit".&lt;ref name=thackston&gt;{{cite book|last=Thackston|first=Shaykh Mushrifuddin Sa'di of Shiraz ; new English translation by Wheeler M.|title=The Gulistan, rose garden of Sa'di: Bilingual English and Persian edition with vocabulary|year=2008|publisher=Ibex Publishers|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=978-1-58814-058-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:The Rose Garden - WDL.tiff|thumb|A page from the introduction]]

After the introduction, the Gulistan is divided into eight chapters, each consisting of a number of stories and poetry:&lt;ref&gt;Chapter titles given in the 1899 translation by Sir Edwin Arnold, http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. The Manners of Kings
:2. On the Morals of Dervishes
:3. On the Excellence of Contentment
:4. On the Advantages of Silence
:5. On Love and Youth
:6. On Weakness and Old Age
:7. On the Effects of Education
:8. On Rules for Conduct in Life

&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/TheGulistanOrRoseGardenOfSadi-EdwardRehatsek&lt;/ref&gt;
Some stories are very brief. They are accompanied by short verses sometimes representing the words of the protagonists, sometimes representing the author's  perspective and sometimes, as in the following case, not clearly attributed:

===Chapter 1, story 34===
One of the sons of Harunu'r-rashid came to his father in a passion, saying, "Such an officer's son has insulted me, by speaking abusively of my mother." Harun said to his nobles, "What should be the punishment of such a person?" One gave his voice for death, and another for the excision of his tongue, and another for the confiscation of his goods and banishment. Harun said, "O my son! the generous part would be to pardon him, and if thou canst not, then do thou abuse his mother, but not so as to exceed the just limits of retaliation, for in that case we should become the aggressors."

:::''They that with raging elephants make war''
:::''Are not, so deem the wise, the truly brave;''
:::''But in real verity, the valiant are''
:::''Those who, when angered, are not passion's slave. ''

:::''An ill-bred fellow once a man reviled,''
:::''Who patient bore it, and replied, "Good friend!''
:::''Worse am I than by thee I could be styled,''
:::''And better know how often I offend."''&lt;ref name=Eastwick&gt;{{cite book|last=Edward B.|first=Eastwick|title=Sadi: The Rose Garden|year=1852|url=https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The king referred to is [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is little biographical information about Sa'di outside of his writings, his short, apparently autobiographical tales, such as the following have been used by commentators to build up an account of his life.

===Chapter 2, story 7===
I remember that, in the time of my childhood, I was devout, and in the habit of keeping vigils, and eager to practise mortification and austerities. One night I sate up in attendance on my father, and did not close my eyes the whole night, and held the precious qur'an in my lap while the people around me slept. I said to my father, "Not one of these lifts up his head to perform a prayer. They are so profoundly asleep that you would say they were dead." He replied, "Life of thy father! it were better if thou, too, wert asleep; rather than thou shouldst be backbiting people."

:::''Naught but themselves can vain pretenders mark,''
:::''For conceit's curtain intercepts their view.''
:::''Did God illume that which in them is dark,''
:::''Naught than themselves would wear a darker hue.''&lt;ref name=Eastwick /&gt;
[[File:Копия Amir Khalil. A youth is marooned by an angry boatman. Sa'di, Gulistan. f.29v. Chester Beatty Library, Dublin..jpg|thumb|The young athlete is marooned on a pillar. [[Chester Beatty Library]], Dublin.]]
Most of the tales within the Gulistan are longer, some running on for a number of pages. In one of the longest, in Chapter 3, Sa'di explores aspects of undertaking a journey for which one is ill-equipped:

===Chapter 3, story 28===
An athlete, down on his luck at home, tells his father how he believes he should set off on his travels, quoting the words:

:::'''As long as thou walkest about the shop or the house''
:::''Thou wilt never become a man, O raw fellow.''
:::''Go and travel in the world''
:::''Before that day when thou goest from the world.'''

His father warns him that his physical strength alone will not be sufficient to ensure the success of his travels, describing five kinds of men who can profit from travel: the rich merchant, the eloquent scholar, the beautiful person, the sweet singer and the artisan. The son nevertheless sets off and, arriving penniless at a broad river, tries to get a crossing on a ferry by using physical force. He gets aboard, but is left stranded on a pillar in the middle of the river. This is the first of a series of misfortunes that he is subjected to, and it is only the charity of a wealthy man that finally delivers him, allowing him to return home safe, though not much humbled by his tribulations. The story ends with the father warning him that if he tries it again he may not escape so luckily:

:::'''The hunter does not catch every time a jackal.''
:::''It may happen that some day a tiger devours him.'''

===Chapter 5, story 5===
In the fifth chapter of The Gulistan of Saadi, on Love and Youth, Saadi includes explicit moral and sociological points about the real life of people from his time period (1203-1291). One story about a schoolboy sheds light on the issues of sexual abuse and pedophilia, problems that have plagued all cultures. This story by Saadi, like so much of his work, conveys meaning on many levels and broadly on many topics. In this story, Saadi communicates the importance of teachers educating the “whole child”—cognitively, morally, emotionally, socially, and ethically. Even though adults and teachers have been accorded great status and respect in Iranian culture and history, in Saadi’s story, he shows that a young boy has great wisdom in understanding his educational needs.

:::''A schoolboy was so perfectly beautiful and sweet-voiced that the teacher, in accordance with human nature, conceived such an affection towards him that he often recited the following verses:''

:::::''I am not so little occupied with you, O heavenly face,''

:::::''That remembrance of myself occurs to my mind.''

:::::''From your sight I am unable to withdraw my eyes''

:::::''Although when I am opposite I may see that an arrow comes.''

:::''Once the boy said to him: “As you strive to direct my studies, direct also my behavior. If you perceive anything reprovable in my conduct, although it may seem approvable to me, inform me thereof that I may endeavor to change it.” He replied: “O boy, make that request to someone else because the eyes with which I look upon you behold nothing but virtues.”''

:::::''The ill-wishing eye, be it torn out''

:::::''Sees only defects in his virtue.''

:::::''But if you possess one virtue and seventy faults''

:::::''A friend sees nothing except that virtue.''&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/TheGulistanOrRoseGardenOfSadi-EdwardRehatsek&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Sa'di's Gulistan is said to be one of the most widely read books ever produced.&lt;ref name=thackston /&gt; From the time of its composition to the present day it has been admired for its "inimitable simplicity",&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; seen as the essence of simple elegant Persian prose. Persian for a long time was the language of literature from Bengal to Constantinople, and the Gulistan was known and studied in much of Asia. In Persian-speaking countries today, proverbs and aphorisms from the Gulistan appear in every kind of literature and continue to be current in conversation, much as [[Shakespeare]] is in English.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibex Publishers' description of Gulistan, http://ibexpub.com/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&amp;products_id=105&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Sir John Malcolm]] wrote in his ''Sketches of Persia'' in 1828, the stories and maxims of Sa'di were "known to all, from the king to the peasant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcom|first=John|title=Sketches of Persia|year=1828|pages=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeIvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
The Gulistan has been significant in the influence of [[Persian literature in Western culture|Persian literature on Western culture]]. [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]] based his "Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol"&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Songe_d%E2%80%99un_Habitant_du_Mogol&lt;/ref&gt; on a story from Gulistan chapter 2 story 16:
A certain pious man in a dream beheld a king in paradise and a devotee in hell. He inquired, "What is the reason of the exaltation of the one, and the cause of the degradation of the other? for I had imagined just the reverse." They said, "That king is now in paradise owing to his friendship for darweshes, and this recluse is in hell through frequenting the presence of kings."

:::''Of what avail is frock, or rosary,''
:::''Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free''
:::''From evil deeds, it will not need for thee''
:::''To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be''
:::''In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.''&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

[[Voltaire]] was familiar with works of Sa'di, and wrote the preface of ''[[Zadig]]'' in his name. He mentions a French translation of the Gulistan, and himself translated a score of verses, either from the original or from some Latin or Dutch translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=William Raleigh|title=The symbolism of Voltaire's novels, with special reference to Zadig|year=1911|publisher=New York Columbia University Press|pages=79|url=https://archive.org/stream/symbolismofvolta00pricuoft/symbolismofvolta00pricuoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Jones]] advised students of Persian to pick an easy chapter of the Gulistan to translate as their first exercise in the language. Thus, selections of the book became the primer for officials of [[Company rule in India|British India]] at [[Fort William College]] and at [[East India Company College|Haileybury College]] in England.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

In the United States [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who addressed a poem of his own to Sa'di, provided the preface for Gladwin's translation, writing, "Saadi exhibits perpetual variety of situation and incident&amp;nbsp;... he finds room on his narrow canvas for the extremes of lot, the play of motives, the rule of destiny, the lessons of morals, and the portraits of great men. He has furnished the originals of a multitude of tales and proverbs which are current in our mouths, and attributed by us to recent writers." [[Henry David Thoreau]] quoted from the book in ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'' and in his remarks on philanthropy in ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

==Translations==
[[File:Gulistan du ryer.JPG|thumb|Frontispiece of André du Ryer's translation]]
Saʿdi was first introduced to the West in a partial French translation by [[André du Ryer]] (1634). Friedrich Ochsenbach based a German translation (1636) on this. Georgius Gentius produced a [[Latin]] version accompanied by the Persian text in 1651.&lt;ref&gt;''Iranian Studies in the Netherlands'', J. T. P. de Bruijn, '''Iranian Studies''', Vol. 20, No. 2/4, Iranian Studies in Europe and Japan (1987), 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Olearius]] made the first direct German translation.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

The Gulistan has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English a number of times: Stephen Sullivan (London, 1774, selections), James Dumoulin (Calcutta, 1807), Francis Gladwin (Calcutta, 1808, preface by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012849298&lt;/ref&gt; James Ross (London, 1823),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/sadi-gulistan2.html&lt;/ref&gt; S. Lee (London, 1827), [[Edward Backhouse Eastwick]] (Hartford, 1852; republished by [[Octagon Press]], 1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eastwick|first=translated by Edward B.|title=The Gulistan of Sadi / The Rose garden of Shekh Muslihu'd-din Sadi of Shiraz ; with a preface, and a life of the author, from the Atish Kadah ; introduction by Idries Shah.|year=1996|publisher=Octagon Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-86304-069-6|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Index:Gulistan or rose garden 1852.djvu|in wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (London, 1863), John T.

Hampton (New York, 1913), and [[Arthur John Arberry]] (London, 1945, the first two chapters).  More recent English translations have been published by [[Omar Ali-Shah]] (1997) and by [[Wheeler M. Thackston]] (2008).

The [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] poet and writer [[Gafur Gulom]] translated The Gulistan into the [[Uzbek language]].

==United Nations quotation==
This well-known verse, part of chapter 1, story 10 of the ''Gulistan'', is woven into a carpet which is hung on a wall in the [[United Nations]] building in New York:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/aug/1234.html Payvand News 24 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;
::::&lt;big&gt;بنی آدم اعضای یک پیکرند &lt;br/&gt; که در آفرينش ز یک گوهرند&lt;/big&gt;
::::&lt;big&gt;چو عضوى به درد آورد روزگار &lt;br/&gt; دگر عضوها را نماند قرار&lt;/big&gt;
::::&lt;big&gt;تو کز محنت دیگران بی غمی &lt;br/&gt; نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی&lt;/big&gt;

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] quoted this in his videotaped [[Nowruz]] (New Year's) greeting to the [[Iran]]ian people in March 2009: "There are those who insist that we be defined by our differences. But let us remember the words that were written by the poet Saadi, so many years ago: 'The children of Adam are limbs to each other, having been created of one essence.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Obama"&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2009-03-20|title=Obama and Israeli Leader Make Taped Appeals to Iran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html|first=Alan|last=Cowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2010-2011 he held an International [[Francqui Foundation|Francqui]] Chair &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080920022543/http://www.francquifoundation.be/ang/chaires%20Internationales%20Historique.htm  Fondation Francqui]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (Belgium), and in 2011 received the Premio Internazionale of the Società Italiana d'Estetica.

In 2003, Levinson co-directed a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Summer Institute, ''Art, Mind, and Cognitive Science'', and during 2001-2003 was President of the American Society for Aesthetics.

==Philosophical work==
Levinson's interest in the aesthetics of music has led to an examination of musical ontology from a historical-contextual perspective, and of performance with an emphasis on performing means. He has posited theories of evaluating music and has considered the legitimacy of emotional response in musical appreciation. Within his study of performance he has also examined the distinctness of performing and critical interpretation.&lt;ref name = NG&gt;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by S. Sadie &amp; J. Tyrell, 2nd ed., London, 2001, [https://stuiterproxy.kuleuven.be/subscriber/article/grove/music/,DanaInfo=www.oxfordmusiconline.com+52016?source=omo_gmo&amp;type=biography&amp;search=quick&amp;q=Jerrold+Levinson&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson advocates the position that music has the same relation to thought as does language; 
i.e., if language is an expression of thought, so is music.  This is particularly revealed in his analysis of [[Wittgenstein]]'s ideas on the meaning in music:
:''What Wittgenstein is underscoring here about the appreciation of music is this. Music is not understood in a vacuum, as a pure structure of sounds fallen from the stars, one which we receive via some pure faculty of musical perception. Music is rather inextricably embedded in our form of life, a form of life that is, as it happens, essentially linguistic. Thus music is necessarily apprehended, at least in part, in terms of the language and linguistic practices that define us and our world.''&lt;ref&gt;

This raises interesting points in the debate on [[absolute music]].

Based in [[Chennai]], [[India]], the academy was founded in January 1936 by [[Rukmini Devi Neelakanta Sastri]] and her husband Arundale. Under Arundale's guidance, the institution achieved national and international recognition for its unique style and perfectionism. In 1962, Kalakshetra moved to a new campus in [[Besant Nagar]], Chennai, occupying {{convert|40|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Kalakshetra, later known as the Kalakshetra Foundation, was established by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]], along with her husband, [[George Arundale]], a well-known [[theosophist]], in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], Chennai, in 1936. She invited not only the best students but also noted teachers, musicians and artists to be a part of this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/arundale.htm |title=Early years of Kalakshetra |website=www.tamilnation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year-long celebrations, including lectures, seminars and festivals marked her 100th birth anniversary, on 29 February 2004, at Kalakshetra and elsewhere in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another centenary celebration |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/27/stories/2003012700070300.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 January 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 29 February, a photo exhibition on her life opened at the Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi, and President [[A.

==Kalakshetra style==
Having studied the [[Pandanallur style]] for three years, in 1936 [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] started working on developing her own, Kalakshetra, style of [[Bharatanatyam]]. She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets.
[[File:Secretary Clinton, Leela Samson, and Ambassador Burleigh Enjoy a Bharat Natyam Performance (2).jpg|thumb|left|Bharatanatyam performance at Kalakshetra, during visit of Hillary Clinton, 2011]]
The Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinesthetics, and its avoidance of [[Recaka]]s and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

According to Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra’s beginnings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guru who inspired love (Sankara Menon’s centenary at Kalakshetra) |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/28/stories/2007092850930100.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by "removing objectionable elements" (mostly, the ''[[Sringara]]'', certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the [[Pandanallur style]], which was publicly criticized by Indian dancer [[Balasaraswati|Tanjore Balasaraswati]] (1918–1984)  and other representatives of [[Tamil Nadu]]'s traditional Isai Velalar culture. Love outside parameters considered "chaste" was not to be portrayed. Balasaraswati said that "the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus". Lawyer and classical artist [[E. Krishna Iyer]] (1897–1968) said about Rukmini Devi, "There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before".

==Gaming Compendiums==

; ''Collecting Cartridges: The Price Guide for Classic Video Game Collectors'': ({{ISBN|9-781545-196113}}) By Michael S. Richardson.  The Atari VCS (2600), 5200, 7800, Mattel Intellivision, Coleco Colecovision and Milton Bradley Microvision. Collecting Cartridges is much more than a book, for many it’s a passion – likely the closest thing to a time machine to our childhoods and a period of time where video game consoles were a completely new concept. It’s technology that demands a fascination, not just by those of us that lived it, but by future generations who wish to enjoy part of this very unique period of time. This guide is a work of love. It came about through the lack of any other detailed price guide that was really reflective of what classic video games, in similar conditions, were selling for. The information took years to compile, but became a personal resource being referenced regularly. There was no reason that if one person found it helpful, many others might as well. The layout of this guide is extremely simple to reference. It explains, through words and pictures, how to categorize any particular game title by its condition. The game titles are then broken down by console, publisher and name. Each title generally has multiple conditions reflective of what the same game would be bought and sold for. Most important is the fact that these prices are, in no way, arbitrary. The prices are an average of each title’s actual selling price. Formulas are used to fill in the value of each game under varying conditions. Great care has also been provided to reference the author(s) of each game. These designers were the proverbial ‘rock stars’ of the day. Part of the enjoyment of collecting is getting to know each programmer and their library of work. This guide contains an appendix which provides a very thorough cross reference. Along with historical information on each console and adding a few fond memories, this guide should be a part of any classic gamer’s library. “Don’t pay too much or accept too little. If you have anything to do with classic video game systems, you need this guide. This is the most accurate way of determining a game’s value.”  Published April 24, 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">'''Liu Xiaofeng''' ({{zh|s=刘小枫}}, b. 1956) is a contemporary Chinese scholar and a professor at [[Renmin University of China]].  He has been considered the prototypical example of what is called a [[cultural Christian]] ({{zh|s=文化基督徒|p=wénhuà jīdūtú}}), meaning a believer who may lack a specific church identification or affiliation, and was, along with [[He Guanghu]], one of the main forerunners of the academic field of [[Sino-Christian Theology]] ({{zh|s=汉语神学|t=漢語神學|p=hànyǔ shénxué}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fällman|first=Fredrik|title=Salvation and Modernity: Intellectuals and Faith in Contemporary China|year=2008|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MA|isbn=9780761840909|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years, his interest has shifted from studies in [[Christian theology]] to the political theories of [[Leo Strauss]].

== Biography ==
Liu Xiaofeng was born in [[Chongqing]], [[China]], in April 1956.

He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in German language and literature at [[Sichuan International Studies University]] before beginning his [[Master of Arts]] in [[aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]] in 1982, completing it in 1985. He later received a scholarship to study at the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] in April 1989, where he completed his [[Ph.D]] in [[Christian theology]] in 1993 on a theological investigation into [[Max Scheler|Max Scheler's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and critique of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Fällman, ''Salvation and Modernity'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also undertook an extensive translation effort of historical and contemporary Christian texts.  A modern writer commented, "Liu's writings have had a major impact in China not only on those Chinese who think of themselves as Christian, but on those who are interested in broad analysis of China in the context of the world's current cultural and philosophical era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aikman|first=David|title=Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power|year=2003|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Inc.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-59698-025-9|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his interpretation of Strauss and other modern Western thinkers has been criticized as one-sided and even deeply flawed; his defense of the Chinese Communist Party, and Mao Zedong in particular, does not go well together with Christianity, nor with Classical Western civilization as described by Strauss and his disciples &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchal|first=Kai,|title=Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss in the Chinese-speaking World: Reorienting the Political|year=2017|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1498536264|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a faculty member of Renmin University of China in the [[School of Liberal Arts]].

The '''''Madonna of Loreto''''' is a c.1507 oil on panel painting by [[Perugino]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]], which bought it in 1879. It shows the Madonna and Child flanked by [[Jerome]] (left) and [[Francis of Assisi]] (right). Two angels hover over Mary's head holding a crown. It reuses the low parapet from ''[[Madonna and Child with St Rose and St Catherine]]'' (1492) and probably also involved the master's studio assistants.  

The painting was commissioned by Giovanni di Matteo Schiavone (died 7 June 1507) for a planned chapel at Santa Maria dei Servi church in Perugia. It was delivered in September 1507. It probably originally had a [[predella]] of three small panels (''Annunciation'', ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' and ''Baptism of Christ''), now in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].

[[File:Meyer-lutz-1894.jpg|right|thumb|Lutz in 1894]]

'''Wilhelm Meyer Lutz''' (19 May 1829 – 31 January 1903) was a German-born British composer and conductor who is best known for light music, musical theatre and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s of well-known works.

Emigrating to the UK at the age of 19, Lutz started as an organist and soon became a theatrical conductor in London. After serving from 1850 to 1855 as music director of the [[Surrey Theatre]], Lutz conducted touring opera companies and composed some serious music and music for the [[Christy Minstrels]].  In 1869, he was engaged as the music director of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], arranging and later composing a series of popular burlesques over the next 25 years. Lutz continued to compose songs into the 20th century.

==Life and career==
Lutz was born in [[Münnerstadt]], Bavaria, Germany.  His parents were Joseph Lutz (1801–1879), a music professor, and Magdalena (1809–1862).  His older brother, Baron Johann Lutz, became the prime minister of Bavaria under King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]].  Lutz studied music first with his father, then in Würzburg at the University.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34639 "Lutz, (Wilhelm) Meyer (1829–1903)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, Retrieved on 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Britain, as a pianist, in 1846, and then moved to England in 1848 at the age of 19.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb.uk.net/garlands/22nd.htm "A Twenty-Second Garland of British Light Music Composers"], Music Web International, Retrieved on 8 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Meyer-lutz-1868.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lutz in 1868]]
Lutz began as an organist in churches at [[Birmingham]] and [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', 2 February 1903, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Then, for many years, he played the organ at [[St George's Cathedral, Southwark|St. George's Roman Catholic Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 August 1854, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz was also a Grand Organist in Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 44, No. 721, 1 March 1903, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz soon became a theatrical conductor.  From 1850 to 1855, he conducted at the [[Surrey Theatre]] and later the [[Royalty Theatre]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; For that theatre, he composed two operas, the one-act ''The Charmed Harp'' (1852) and a [[grand opera]], ''[[Faust and Marguerite (opera)|Faust and Marguerite]]'' (1855).&lt;ref name=Italian&gt;[http://www.italianopera.org/compositori/L/c219326E.htm "Wilhelm Meyer Lutz"], ItalianOpera.org&lt;/ref&gt; After this, for many years, Lutz conducted concerts in the British provinces and touring opera troupes for [[Giulia Grisi]], the [[tenor]] [[Mario (tenor)|Mario]] and others.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;''Musical Times'', November 1859&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were led by the [[tenor]] Elliot Galer (the founder, in 1877, of the Royal Opera House in [[Leicester]]),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tjwOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA558&amp;lpg=RA1-PA558&amp;dq=galer+tenor+%22opera+house%22+Leicester&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JflH0AF-o6&amp;sig=AKbpMN37TzubbbnVik9p9UtVPio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result ''A Dictionary of the Drama''], p. 558, Burt Franklin, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; who produced Lutz's opera ''Zaida, or, The Pearl of Granada'' (with a libretto by Oliver Summers) in 1859 in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In the 1850s and 1860s he shared the concert podium at classical concerts with [[Julius Benedict]] both in the provinces and at [[St. James's Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 6 November 1853, p. 1, and 29 April 1866&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, in [[Derby, England|Derby]], England, Lutz played the piano for a series of ten "Concerts for the People" at the Temperance Hall.&lt;ref name=MT/&gt; Galer also mounted three other Lutz operas at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in London: ''Blonde or Brunette'' (1862), ''Cousin Kate'' (1863), and ''Felix, or The Festival of the Roses'' (1865).&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt;  During these years, Lutz also composed the [[cantata]]s ''Herne the Hunter'' ([[The Crystal Palace]], 1862) and ''King Christmas'' ([[Oxford Music Hall]], 1863), and music for the [[Christy Minstrels]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Gaiety Theatre years===
In 1869, manager [[John Hollingshead]] hired Lutz as the resident musical director and conductor at the recently opened [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], composing dances and songs for productions at that theatre, as well as conducting the orchestra for the operas, [[operetta]]s, plays and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] mounted at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In this capacity, he conducted ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]], in 1871.

[[Image:Ruyblasbrochure.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Souvenir programme]] from ''Ruy Blas'']]
Lutz's early compositions for the Gaiety theatre included [[incidental music]] for ''Dreams'' (1869), a play by [[Thomas W. Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1898), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Miller of Milburg'' (1872).&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; At the same time, [[Christine Nilsson]] performed his scena ''Xenia the Sclavonian Maiden'' (1869), and at the [[Covent Garden]] [[Promenade Concerts]] in 1873, his cantata, ''Legend of the Lys'', was performed.&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; He also composed music for such shows as ''On Condition'' (1882) and ''Posterity'' (1884) for Lila Clay's all-ladies troupe.  He also composed the popular song, "Eyes of English Blue" for Alice Atherton.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

At the Gaiety, Lutz compiled the scores, and later often composed original music, for a series of popular pasticcio entertainments, opera-bouffes and burlesques,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; including ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877); ''Robbing Roy'' (1879 by [[F. C. Burnand]]); a version of ''The Forty Thieves'' (1880, libretto by [[Robert Reece]]; Lutz had conducted [[The Forty Thieves|an 1878 version]] of the same story); ''All in the Downs; or, Black-Eyed Susan'' (1881); ''Aladdin'' (1881); ''Oh! Those Girls'' (1882);&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1898), pp. 462–75&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Beard'' (1882); ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883, with a libretto by [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]]); ''Ariel'' (1883, libretto by Burnand); and ''Mazeppa'' (1884).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

[[George Edwardes]] took over management of the Gaiety in 1885 and expanded the format of the burlesques, commissioning Lutz to write original scores for the "new burlesques" at the theatre: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885, libretto by Stephens); ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886); ''[[Miss Esmeralda]], or The Maid and the Monkey'' (1887); ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887); ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888, libretto by G. R. Sims and Henry Pettitt); ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889, libretto by [[Frederick Hobson Leslie]] and Herbert F. Clark); ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890, libretto by Sims and Pettitt);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm Programme for ''Carmen up to Data''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |date=10 December 2008 }}, ArthurLloyd website&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891, libretto by Leslie);&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; and ''Don Juan'' (1892, book by Leslie, lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).  The "Pas de quatre", a sprightly barn-dance written for ''Faust up to Date'', remained popular for more than fifty years and has had at least two modern recordings.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recordings on CD include those by the London Concert Orchestra, Ronald Corp conductor (Hyperion CDA66868), and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Barry Wordsworth conductor (Warner Classics 2564620202).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, with [[Albert O'Donnell Bartholeyns]], he wrote ''A la Française''.&lt;ref&gt;"Slashes and Puffs", ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', 19 July 1893, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music to a dance from ''[[Faust up to date]]'']]
During these years, Lutz continued in demand as a conductor throughout Britain&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''The Times'', 20 July 1880, p. 10, describing a large-scale "Mozart-Beethoven Festival Concert" directed by Lutz and noting that his services were "always enlisted on such... occasions".&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to compose religious and secular music.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; On 3 May 1886, the Gaiety Theatre hosted a selection of scenes played for Lutz's benefit, including scenes from Lutz's grand opera ''Faust and Marguerite'', his burlesque ''Little Jack Sheppard'' and the operetta ''Karl'' and several recitations and solo pieces.  The performers included [[Nellie Farren]] (who had sung under him in nearly all of his Gaiety pieces), [[Marion Hood]], [[Durward Lely]], [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon.  [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchive.htm Information about Lutz's benefit performance] Gilbert and Sullivan memorabilia archive site&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Lutz left the Gaiety in 1894 and was replaced by [[Ivan Caryll]].  For the [[Opera Comique]] in 1895, Lutz composed ''A Model Trilby, or A Day or Two after du Maurier''.&lt;ref name=Italian/&gt; He also wrote additional songs for ''[[Baron Golosh]]'' for the [[Trafalgar Theatre]] (1895).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Baron+Golosh%22+Lutz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mPlA0Cj8Pq&amp;sig=yi470SyutQRrTBlgHJWqE5dJCU4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TL2rSvvKCouXlAeK5OjOBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1# ''A dictionary of the drama''], p. 113, Chatto &amp; Windus, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz wrote a string quartet and ballads such as "Thy Silv'ry Tones", "Enchant Mine Ear" and "Sail on Silver Cloud."  In the last years of the 19th century, Lutz conducted a band playing Summer seasons at the spa in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]].&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; He continued to compose songs into the 20th century, including music for ''Hidenseek'' (1901) and a few numbers for [[Ivan Caryll]] and Cecil Cook's ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1902).  However, Lutz seems to have run low on funds, as another benefit was held for him on 28 November 1901 at the Gaiety Theatre, organised by George Edwardes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 October 1901, announcing the benefit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz was married in 1856 to Elizabeth Cook (b. 1835) and later to her sister Emily Cook (b. 1847).&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Comic Opera Goes Latin-American, 1890–92: Part 2" in ''The Gaiety'', Winter 2006, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Their brothers were the [[basso|bass]] Thomas Aynsley Cook (1833–1894) and the [[baritone]] [[John Furneaux Cook]], and their sister, Alice Aynsley Cook (c. 1850–1938), was also an opera singer and musical comedy actress.  His niece, Annie, married [[Eugène Goossens, fils|Eugene Goossens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Lutz
also had a son, Caspar, who became a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 17 December 1908, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In printed works, such as scores and theatre programmes, Lutz was usually credited simply as Meyer Lutz.  Some of Lutz's music was arranged for military band by J. A. Kappey.&lt;ref&gt;Kappey, J. A. ''Reminiscences of The Gaiety'' (Boosey's military Journal, 1891) ASIN: B0000CZ6RL.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutz is mentioned in a [[P. G. Wodehouse]] novel, ''[[A Damsel in Distress (novel)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Wodehouse, P. G. [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dmsnd11.txt ''A Damsel in Distress''], chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a character called Herr Toots in the 1912 novel ''Bella'' by Edward Booth is based on Lutz,&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; as is the character Meyer Klootz in the 1940 novel ''Town and Haven'' by Oswald Harland, both novels being set in late Victorian Scarborough (named "Spathorpe" in ''Bella'', and "Whitcliff" in ''Town and Haven'').

Lutz died of bronchitis at his home in [[Kensington]], London at the age of 73.  He was buried in St Mary's, Kensal Green.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

'''MozartNu (1986–2008)''' is a contemporary dance performance conceived by the Spanish director, [[Iago Pericot]]. It is derived from Pericot's ''MozartNu'', which premiered in 1986. The original 1986 version of ''MozartNu'', inspired by the [[Coronation Mass (Mozart)|Coronation Mass]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], showed the beauty of human relationships through the naked bodies of two dancers.

In ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'', the original version is performed by one couple on one platform, while another couple dances simultaneously on a separate platform on the same stage. These parallel performances reflect the changes that have been the result of these human relationships over time.

The premiere production of ''MozartNu (1986–2008)'' was April 15–20, 2008 at ''El Mercat de les Flors'' in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name = "lugaresnaturistas.org"&gt;{{Cite web | title = MozartNu (1986-2008) - The human beauty and musical | publisher = lugaresnaturistas.org | url = http://www.lugaresnaturistas.org/mozartnu.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older dancers were the dancers who performed in the original ''MozartNu'' of 1986.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10645">The '''National Theatre of the Deaf''' ('''NTD''') was founded in 1967 and is the oldest [[theatre company]] in the [[United States]] with a continuous history of domestic and international touring and producing original works.&lt;ref name="NTD History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ntd_history.html|title=National Theatre of the Deaf - HISTORY|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTD productions combine [[American Sign Language]] with [[spoken language]] to fulfill the theatre's [[mission statement]] of linking [[Hearing loss|deaf]] and [[hearing]] communities and educating the public about [[Deaf culture|Deaf art]]. The NTD is affiliated with a [[Acting School|drama school]], also founded in 1967, and with the Little Theatre of the Deaf (LTD), established in 1968 to produce shows for a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ltd_about.html|title=ABOUT the Little Theatre of the Deaf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first official performance of the NTD was at [[Wesleyan University]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Theatre-of-the-Deaf|title=National Theatre of the Deaf American Theatre Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTD members participated in the first National and Worldwide Deaf Theatre Conference in 1994. Many deaf actors have earned acclaim through their work with the NTD in performances, conferences, and community outreach. The NTD has been fundamental in the creation of an international Deaf theatre community, and has received several awards, including the [[Tony Award]] for Theatrical Excellence. The company has visited each of the [[Fifty States|50 states]] during over 150 national tours, as well as over 30 countries.

== Founding ==
In 1946, [[Robert Panara]], a [[Gallaudet University]] graduate and newly hired teacher at the [[New York School for the Deaf]], produced a play with [[Bernard Bragg]], a 17-year-old student in Panara's English class.&lt;ref name="Powers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf|last=Powers|first=Helen|date=1972|publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=|isbn=|location=New York|page=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1940s, when Bragg was a student at Gallaudet, Panara left New York School for the Deaf to teach at Gallaudet. While both at Gallaudet, Panara and Bragg conceived of the idea of a theater for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Dr. Edna Levine, a professor of [[Deaf studies]] at [[New York University]], saw Bragg perform a [[one-man show]] in [[New York City]]. She asked him for a meeting and shared her own vision for a national theater for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, they obtained a federal grant from the [[U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] to establish the NTD. Additional grant money was given by the [[Office of Education]].&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company" /&gt; [[Mary E. Switzer]] of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and Boyce R. Williams and Malcolm Norwood of the [[Rehabilitation Services Administration]] were important advocates of funding the NTD.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;

Levine and Bragg worked with [[set designer]] David Hays to establish a mission statement, locate funding, select a location, and assemble a company. The founders also included [[Ann Bancroft]], who played [[Annie Sullivan]] in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]'', and [[Arthur Penn]] and Gene Lasko, directors of ''The Miracle Worker''.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pictures in the Air: The Story of the National Theatre of the Deaf|last=Baldwin|first=Stephen C.|date=1993|publisher=[[Gallaudet University Press]]|year=|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and location==

The founders' mission was to feature sign language in the theater for both deaf and hearing audiences. The founders believed that audience members need to “hear every word and see every word” in all NTD productions.&lt;ref name="NTD Mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntd.org/ntd_mission.html|title=National Theatre of the Deaf MISSION|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NTD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill this mission, productions included both deaf and hearing actors. The language used by the deaf performers included sign language, [[Mime artist|mime]], and [[gesture]], and the hearing actors provided spoken language. Bragg had studied under the French mime [[Marcel Marceau]], and his acting style influenced the early NTD productions.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Helen (1972). ''Signs of Silence: Bernard Bragg and the National Theatre of the Deaf''. New York: Dodd, Mead. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardbragg.com/biography/|title=Act One: It All Began on Metropolitan Street|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BernardBragg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardbragg.com/|title=Honored With NTD Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BernardBragg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the NTD was located on the campus of the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center]] in [[Waterford, Connecticut]]. In 1983, the NTD moved to [[Chester, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|63-64}} In 2000, the NTD moved to [[Hartford, CT|Hartford, Connecticut]], and in 2004 moved onto the campus of the [[American School for the Deaf]] in [[West Hartford, CT|West Hartford]]. Since 2012, the NTD has again been based at the O'Neill Theatre Center while maintaining a satellite office on the campus of the American School for the Deaf.&lt;ref name="NTD American Theatre Company" /&gt;

[[Linda Bove]] appeared regularly on the television series ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

Other actors who have worked with NTD include [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Sir Michael Redgrave]], [[Chita Rivera]], [[Jason Robards]], and [[Meryl Streep]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Helen C. "National theater troupe breathes life into words," ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', January 29, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; While some NTD actors have achieved recognition in hearing theatre, a greater number of Deaf actors, including [[Chuck Baird]], Eric Malzkuhn, [[Ed Waterstreet]], Gilberst Eastman, Mary Beth Miller, and Manny Hernandez, have achieved recognition primarily within deaf theatre.

Though not an NTD actor, [[Lauren Ridloff]], the actress cast as Sarah in the 2018 revival of ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'', was nominated in May 2018 for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/theater/tony-awards-nominees-list.htm|title=Tony Awards 2018 Full List of Nominations|last=|first=|date=|website=New York Times|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions, touring, and reception==

Rehearsals and performances occupied most of each day for both company actors and students. The company toured by [[bus]] both domestically and internationally, received only [[Part-time contract|part-time]] pay, and paid [[Out-of-pocket expense|out-of-pocket]] for their travel.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|125-129}} Both the company and the students lived [[dormitory]]-style at the O'Neill Theatre Center while rehearsing, and slept either on the bus or in inexpensive hotels while touring domestically. While touring internationally, the actors stayed in [[Hostel|hostels]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lessons in Laughter: The Autobiography of a Deaf Actor|last=Bragg|first=Bernard|date=1989|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company performed both traditional plays and plays written by Deaf playwrights.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|121-124}} Hearing audiences have typically had positive responses to NTD productions, while Deaf and [[Hard-of-hearing|Hard of Hearing]] audiences have often had mixed reviews. Deaf and Hard of Hearing audience members sometimes expected productions to be more focused around the Deaf experience, and to be less highly dramatized. Some Deaf audience members have seen NTD productions as catering to Hearing audiences, which has generated a negative response. However, many Deaf audience members have responded positively and appreciated NTD productions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|115-116}}

The NTD has been discussed in newspapers such as ''[[Silent News]]'', journals such as the ''Puppetry Journal'', and television shows such as ''Deaf Mosaic'', which aired during the 1980s and 1990s. Many scholars have written about the NTD in books and [[dissertations]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt;{{rp|24-25; 41-42; 55-56; 70-71; 83-84; 95-96; 109-110; 117-118}}

The '''Open Publication License''' (OPL) was published by the [[Open Content Project]] in 1999 as a [[public copyright license]] for documents.&lt;ref name="opl"/&gt; It superseded the [[Open Content License]], which was published by the Open Content Project in 1998.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; Starting around 2002-2003, it began to be superseded, in turn, by the [[Creative Commons license]]s.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, the Open Content Project published a licence called the Open Content License, which was among the first (perhaps ''the'' first) public copyright licenses intended for ''content'' (i.e. documents) rather than for ''software''.&lt;ref name="ocl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; The following year, it published the Open Publication License, which was intended to be an improvement upon the Open Content License.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

The two licenses differ substantially: the Open Publication License is not a [[share-alike]] license while the Open Content License is; and the Open Publication License can optionally restrict the distribution of derivative works or restrict the commercial distribution of paper copies of the work or derivatives of the work, whereas the Open Content License forbids copying for profit altogether.

In June 2003, David A. Wiley, the founder of the Open Content Project, indicated that the Creative Commons licenses, which were developed in collaboration with lawyers, would be "more likely to stand up in court" than the Open Content Project licenses, which were not.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; He also announced that for this reason, he was joining [[Creative Commons]] and shutting down the Open Content Project, and that users thinking of using an Open Content Project license would be "far better off using a Creative Commons license".&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Confusingly, the Open Content License gives its abbreviation as "OPL" rather than "OCL",&lt;ref name="ocl"/&gt; and that license is sometimes referred to by the former initialism.&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt; ("OPL", as used by the Open Content Project in 1998, stood for OpenContent Principles and License.)&lt;ref name="opl-explanation"/&gt; Nevertheless, the license's author has subsequently referred to that license as the "OCL", and to the Open Publication License as the "OPL".&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt; This ambiguity about the initialism "OPL" risks confusion, and the only sure way to know which of the two licenses is being referred to, in a given context, is to look for the full name.&lt;ref name="fsf-ocl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt;

== Reception ==
According to the [[Free Software Foundation]], the Open Publication License "can be used as a free documentation license" and is "a copyleft free documentation license provided the copyright holder does not exercise any of the 'LICENSE OPTIONS' listed in Section VI of the license."&lt;ref name="fsf-opl"/&gt; It is not, however, [[License compatibility|compatible]] with the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GNU FDL]].&lt;ref name="fsf-opl" /&gt;

In March 2004, the OPL v1.0 was determined by the [[Debian]] legal team to be incompatible with the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].&lt;ref name="debian-legal"/&gt;

In October 2004, an analysis of the Open Public License was published by Andrew M. St. Laurent, the author of ''Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html Open Source and Free Documentation Licenses, Part 2: The Open Publication License], Onlamp.com, Andrew M. St. Laurent, October 7, 2004{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==

[[Eric S. Raymond]]'s book ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'' (1999) was published under the Open Publication License.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ Cathedral and Bazaar] on catb.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Perens]] used the license for the [[Bruce Perens' Open Source Series]] of books.&lt;ref name="meet the perens"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the Perens |url=http://akashsingh.ulitzer.com/node/32606 |first=Joe |last=Barr |publisher=''LinuxWorld Magazine'' |date=January 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Linux Gazette]] used the Open Publication License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linuxgazette.net/faq/general.html#copying|title=Linux Gazette : FAQ : General FAQ|website=linuxgazette.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Fedora Project|Fedora]] project used the license for their documentation until approximately 2009-2010 when the project switched to a [[CC-BY-SA]] license.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Archive:Relicensing_OPL_to_CC_BY_SA?rd=Relicensing_OPL_to_CC_BY_SA Archive:Relicensing OPL to CC BY SA], Fedoraproject.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCL predates the GFDL (Nov 2002) and Creative Commons (Dec 2002) by over four years, while the improved OPL predates both by over three years. The OCL was developed primarily by me... The improved OPL was written primarily by Eric Raymond after discussions with me, Tim O’Reilly, and others... The OPL was truly innovative in that, in addition to requiring citation of the original author as source, it contained two license options which authors could choose to invoke: one restricts users’ abilities to creative derivative works, while the second restricts users’ abilities to make certain commercial uses of the material. The student of open content licensing will recognize that these are exactly the options that Creative Commons now employs. What may be forgotten is that in version 1.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, Attribution was actually included in the licenses only as an option. In version 2.0 of the CC licenses (May 24, 2004) attribution was standard on every license, and there were two licenses options: one regarding derivative works, and one regarding commercial use. So in terms of high level structure, the OPL was here about five years before CC. ... Actually, the [OCL and OPL] licenses weren’t that great, seeing as I am not a lawyer, and neither was anyone else involved in the creation of the license. The concept was right, and the execution was “good enough,” but Creative Commons (with its excellent lawyers and law school students) created a better legal instrument. As I said on the opencontent.org homepage on Monday June 30, 2003: 'My main goal in beginning OpenContent back in the Spring of 1998 was to evangelize a way of thinking about sharing materials, especially those that are useful for supporting education. ... I’m closing OpenContent because I think Creative Commons is doing a better job of providing licensing options which will stand up in court [and I'm joining] Creative Commons as Director of Educational Licenses. Now I can focus in on facilitating the kind of sharing most interesting to me ... with the pro bono support of really good IP lawyers... The OpenContent License and Open Publication License will remain online for archival purposes in their current locations. However, no future development will occur on the licenses themselves.' ... Anyone interested in a license like this is far better off using a Creative Commons license.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10334">'''Participatory art''' is an approach to making art which engages [[public participation]] in the creative process, letting them become co-authors, editors, and observers of the work. This type of art is incomplete without viewers' physical interaction. It intends to challenge the dominant form of making art in the West, in which a small class of professional artists make the art while the public takes on the role of passive observer or consumer, i.e., buying the work of the professionals in the marketplace. Commended works by advocates who popularized participatory art include [[Augusto Boal]] in his [[Theater of the oppressed]], as well as [[Allan Kaprow]] in [[happenings]].

One of the earliest usages of the term appears in photographer [[Richard Ross (photographer)]]'s review for the [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art]] journal of the exhibition "Downtown Los Angeles Artists," organized by the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum in 1980. Describing ''in situ'' works by [[Jon Peterson (artist)]], Maura Sheehan and Judy Simonian anonymously placed around Santa Barbara, Ross wrote, "These artists bear the responsibility to the community. Their art is participatory."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ross."At Large In Santa Barbara." ''LAICA Journal''. September–October 1980, Number 28. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Participatory art requires of the artist that they either not be present, or that they somehow are able to recede far enough to become equal with the participants. This is the only way that participants might be offered the agency of creation; without this detail, participants will always respond within the domain of authority of the artist; they will be subjugated in this way, and the work will fail to be participatory. This detail is centrally important in asserting Participation as a form in itself, and effectively differentiates Participation from interactive, community based art and socially engaged art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11152406/Participation_Hosting_And_Mimesis_The_Double_Being|title=Participation, Hosting And Mimesis: The Double Being|last=Mount|first=Andrew|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these techniques can include the presence of the artist, as it will not impinge upon the outcome of the work in the same way.

There are various degrees of participation from nominal manipulation of an object like the wearable sculptures of [[Lygia Clark]] to the relinquishing of the artist's body to the whims of the audience in the 1974 performance ''Rhythm 0'' by [[Marina Abramović]]. New media theorist Beryl Graham has compared the varying degrees of participation in the arts to the eight rungs of power described in [[Sherry Arnstein]]'s "Ladder of Citizen Participation"—ranging from manipulation to token consulting, to complete citizen control. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Beryl|date=|title=What kind of participative system? Critical Vocabularies from new media art.|url=|journal=The 'do-it-yourself' artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media|volume=|pages=290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall/Winter issue of Oregon Humanities magazine, writer Eric Gold describes "an artistic tradition called '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|social practice]],' which refers to works of art in which the artist, audience, and their interactions with one another are the medium. While a painter uses pigment and canvas, and a sculptor wood or metal, the social practice artist often creates a scenario in which the audience is invited to participate. Although the results may be documented with photography, video, or otherwise, the artwork is really the interactions that emerge from the audience's engagement with the artist and the situation."

Participatory or interactive art creates a dynamic collaboration between the artist, the audience and their environment. Participatory art is not just something that you stand still and quietly look at–it is something you participate in. You touch it, smell it, write on it, talk to it, dance with it, play with it, learn from it. You co-create it.

It is important to point out that there has been some nominal obfuscation of Participatory Art, causing its appreciation as a distinct form to be stymied. It is most likely that this occurred simultaneously with the development of the term [[Relational Aesthetics]] by [[Special:BookSources/2840660601|Bourriaud]] in the late 1990s. Some other art making techniques, such as [[Community arts|'community-based art']], '[[interactive art]]', or '[[Social Practice#Art and Social Practice|socially-engaged art]]' have been (mis)labelled as Participatory art, simply because the subtleties of distinction are not always clearly understood or cared about. Many forms of popular culture and media beyond visual art have grown increasingly participatory with the rise of the [[Internet]] and [[social media]], which allow users to participate at a distance.

== Examples ==
[[Janet Cardiff]] has created various audio tours that users experience by walking site-specific routes and listening to soundscapes composed by the artist. 

[[Figment (arts event)]] is an annual showcase of participatory art in New York City.

[[Antony Gormley]] has involved the public in the creation of several works, most notably [[One &amp; Other]] which invited hundreds of participants to occupy the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|vacant plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] and perform or otherwise contribute to the work. 

[[Carsten Höller]] has created interactive installations like Test Site (2006), which invites participants to play on giant slides installed in the [[Tate Modern]]. 

[[Allan Kaprow]] pioneered the field of participatory art with his [[Happening]] events staged in 1960's New York City, which used physical installations and prompts to facilitate aesthetic experiences for participants.  

[http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/ Learning to Love you More] (2002–2009) was a work of [[Internet art]] by [[Miranda July]] and [[Harrell Fletcher]] that invited participants to submit responses to written prompts, and displayed an archive of the resulting works of [[conceptual art]].

[[Adrian Piper]] led a series of events titled Funk Lessons (1982 –1984) that combined participatory dance-parties with conversations and lectures about African-American culture.

[http://www.publicartstation.org Public Art Stations] (2013 - present) allow the public freedom in the creation of works, usually in watercolor.

== Influences ==
Folk and tribal art can be considered to be a predecessor or model for contemporary "participatory art" in that many or all of the members of the society participate in the making of "art". However, the ideological issue of ''use'' arises at this point because art made in the institutions of art is by default, already part of the art world, and therefore it's perceived ''use'' is entirely different to any ritualistic or traditional practices expressed by folk or tribal groups. As the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl wrote, the tribal group "has no specialization or professionalization; its division of labor depends almost exclusively on sex and occasionally on age, and only rarely are certain individuals proficient in any technique to a distinctive degree ... the same songs are known by all the members of the group, and there is little specialization in composition, performance or instrument making.” &lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, ''Music in Primitive Culture'', Cambridge, Harvard 1956, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1603">'''Pattern gardening''' is a method of designing gardens influenced by the concepts of [[patterns]] and [[pattern language]] originated by [[Christopher Alexander]]. It reflects the archetypal patterns of garden making, based on proportions and how the senses react. Patterns give coherence to [[garden design]] and communicate creativity and aesthetics.

Specific elements are instinctively looked for in a garden. Working with these elements is the basis for all good garden design.  Each such element, or pattern, is archetypal, and therefore any pattern can be easily adapted to any garden situation. The fourteen pattern elements are:

*Scale, which relates the garden to the environment; 
*Garden rooms, which divide and connect the garden; 
*Pathways, which define what we see in the garden; 
*Bridges, which differentiate garden spaces and create compelling focal points; 
*Gates, which are the portal to the garden; 
*Shelters, which anchor the garden in space; 
*Borders, which separate and make distinct garden sections; 
*Patios, which tie the house to the landscape; 
*Sheds, which add texture; 
*Focal points, which create destinations in the garden; 
*Water, which fully engages the senses; 
*Ornamentation, which creates mood; 
*Containers, which allow artistic flexibility; and, 
*Materials, which add bulk, solidity, and softness to the garden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

'''Post-Impressionism''' (also spelled '''Postimpressionism''') is a predominantly French [[art movement]] that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of [[Fauvism]]. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cloisonnism]], [[Pont-Aven School]], and [[Synthetism]], along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by [[Paul Cézanne]] (known as father of Post-impressionism), [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Timeline, Post-Impressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Post-Impressionism'' was first used by art critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="brettell"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=v5TcYXGDeI8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22the+term+Post-impressionism%22,+%221906%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqYXYo8DMAhVLuhQKHROHBYAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20term%20Post-impressionism%22%2C%20%221906%22&amp;f=false Richard R. Brettell, ''Modern Art, 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al"&gt;Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, William C. Agee, ''The Advent of Modernism. Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918'', High Museum of Art, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Frank Rutter]] in a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]] published in ''Art News'', 15 October 1910, described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen&gt;Bullen, J. B. ''Post-impressionists in England'', p.37. Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00216-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-00216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition, ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', defining it as the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. 

Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. [[Georges Seurat]] and his followers concerned themselves with [[Pointillism]], the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. [[Paul Cézanne]] set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to "make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums".&lt;ref&gt;Huyghe, Rene: ''Impressionism''. (1973). Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books Inc., p. 222. {{OCLC|153804642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] experimented with [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated [[Pointillism]], which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer [[Impressionism]] in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cogniat, Raymond (1975). Pissarro. New York: Crown, pp. 69–72. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173&amp;section_id=T068997#skipToContent Caroline Boyle-Turner, ''Post-Impressionism, History and application of the term'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as [[Fauvism]] and [[Cubism]], breaking from Post-Impressionism.

==Defining Post-Impressionism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|left|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]]]]
[[Image:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''Portrait of [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'', 1886, [[Tate Gallery]] [[London]]]]
The term was used in 1906,&lt;ref name="brettell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al" /&gt; and again in 1910 by [[Roger Fry]] in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', organized by Fry for the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/manetpostimpress00graf  ''Manet and the post-impressionists''; Nov. 8 to Jan. 15, 1910-11, Grafton Galleries, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Fry's show, art critic [[Frank Rutter]] had put the term ''Post-Impressionist'' in print in ''Art News'' of 15 October 1910, during a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen /&gt;

Most of the artists in Fry's exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: "For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence (2005). ''Facts on File Encyclopedia of Art'': 5. New York: Facts on File, p. 804. {{ISBN|0-8160-5802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rewald]] limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, ''History of Impressionism'', and pointed out that a "subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period":&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"&gt;Rewald, John: ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'', revised edition: Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse'', was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as [[van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Seurat]], and [[Odilon Redon|Redon]]. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* [[Neo-Impressionism]]: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as [[Pointillism]]; [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac|Signac]] would have preferred other terms: [[Divisionism]] for example
* [[Cloisonnism]]: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]], was to promote the work of [[Louis Anquetin]], and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]
* [[Synthetism]]: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889|Café Volpini]].
* [[Pont-Aven School]]: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Henri Rousseau]] "le Douanier", [[Les Nabis]] and [[Cézanne]] as well as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], the young [[Picasso]] and Gauguin's last trip to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.

===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that "the term 'Post-Impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one." Convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886.  Rewald's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to "let the sources speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"/&gt;

Rival terms like [[Modernism]] or [[Symbolism in art|Symbolism]] were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* [[Modernism]], thus, is now considered to be the central movement within ''international'' western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: [[The Nabis]] for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term 'Post-Impressionism' were challenged again: [[Alan Bowness]] and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of [[World War I]], but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

So, while a split may be seen between classical 'Impressionism' and 'Post-Impressionism' in 1886, the end and the extent of 'Post-Impressionism' remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, '[[Cubism]]' was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in Anglosaxonia. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called [[Abstract painting|abstract]] and [[Suprematism|suprematic]]—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, ''Post-Impressionism'' is a term best used within Rewald's definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of ''[[Impressionists|impressionist]]'' painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from [[Cloisonnism]] to [[Cubism]]. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a [[World War I|World War]]—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about "Post-Impressionism" works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of "Post-Impressionism" in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

Theatrical '''production management''' is a sub-division of [[stagecraft]]. The production management team (consisting of a production manager and any number of assistants) is responsible for realizing the visions of the [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and the [[Theatre director|director]] or [[choreographer]] within constraints of technical possibility. This involves coordinating the operations of various production sub-disciplines ([[scenic design|scenic]], [[wardrobe]], [[lighting]], [[sound]], [[Video projector|projection]], [[automation]], [[video]], [[pyrotechnics]], [[stage management]], etc.) of the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Theatre_Production_Manager_Duties_Outlook_and_Requirements.html Study.com production management job]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/production_manager_job_description.htm prospects.ac.uk, production management job]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to management and financial skills, a production manager must have detailed knowledge of all production disciplines including a thorough understanding of the interaction of these disciplines during the production process. This may involve dealing with matters ranging from the procurement of staff, materials and services, to [[freight]], [[customs|customs coordination]], [[telecommunications]], labor relations, [[logistics]], [[information technology]], [[wikt:liaison|government liaison]], venue booking, scheduling, operations management, mending delay problems and workplace [[safety]].

==Psychoanalysis==

The term was introduced to translate [[Freud]]'s {{lang|de|Schaulust}}, or pleasure in looking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the [[Rat Man]] called "a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of [[Otto Fenichel]], with special reference to [[Identification (psychology)|identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk5gPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+collected+papers+of+otto+fenichel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhhhTbTNGc3Oswa3uLW1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ ''The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification''] (1953) {{ISBN|0-393-33741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel maintained that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] subsequently drew on [[Sartre]]'s theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: "the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] image of the other;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (1990) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneiderman|first1=Stuart|title=Returning to Freud: Clinical Psychoanalysis in the School of Lacan|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300039320|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==

[[Voyeurism]] plays a role in the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably in the 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the film, [[Norman Bates]] is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on [[Marion Crane]], while she is in a state of undress.

Scopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)

Building on Lacan's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills,[https://books.google.com/books?id=65HbQfMKmAIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=scopophobia&amp;lr= "The Money Shot"] (2001) {{ISBN|1-86403-142-5}},  p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; scopophilia was used by [[Film|cinema]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]]s of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton Caldwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=59S8pfkFb-IC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=scopophobia#PPA343,M1 ''Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television''] (1995) {{ISBN|0-8135-2164-5}}, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyeurism]] and the [[male gaze]] have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) pp. 316–17&lt;/ref&gt; and are most famously discussed in [[Laura Mulvey]]'s influential 1975 essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=England|isbn=978-1-4039-9246-8|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, have objected to the element of [[scapegoating]] in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklitsch|first1=Robert|title=Roll over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|date=2006|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|isbn=978-0791467336|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Roll_Over_Adorno.html?id=oCprHBiGYoMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==

[[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]], such as [[bell hooks]],&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bCqfK3m3GsC&amp;q "Eating the Other"], 2006 {{ISBN|1-4288-1629-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Marriott,&lt;ref&gt;David Marriott, "Bordering On: The Black Penis", (1996), ''[[Textual Practice]]'' 10(1), pp. 9–28.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shannon Winnubst,&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Winnubst, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8HwslvL598C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=queer+freedom&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HRxhTZv9M4jNswbY9IC2CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=is%20the%20mirror%20racist&amp;f=false "Is the Mirror Racist?: Interrogating the Space of Whiteness"], (2006) {{ISBN|0-253-21830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also taken up scopophilia and the scopic drive as a mechanism to describe racial "other-ing" (c.f. [[scopophobia]]).

In their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.&lt;ref&gt;Todd W. Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'' (2011) pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
* The ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Gaius Petronius Arbiter]] is pervaded with scopophilia, as when a priestess of [[Priapus]] was "the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''[[The Satyricon]]'' (Penguin 1986) p. 50 and p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Secret Sexualities'', Ian McCormick notes the inter-relationship of public and private, and of the open and the secret, as features that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Ian. ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing''. Routledge, 1997. pp. 1-11; p. 158. See also George E. Haggerty.

'''''Sequences Real Time Art Festival''''' is an independent biennial, established in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] in 2006. 

The aim of the festival is to produce and present progressive visual art with special focus on time-based mediums, such as [[performance]], [[sound art]], video and public interventions. An offspring of the dynamic art scene that thrives in Reykjavik, Sequences is the first art festival in Iceland to focus on visual art alone. New artistic directors are hired to reshape each edition of Sequences according to their vision, making it unique and different every time.

== Concept ==
The aim of the festival is to celebrate and exhibit cutting-edge visual art with a special emphasis on art in public/urban spaces. Sequences features time-based art - such as [[performance]], video and [[sound art]] - and creates a cross-platform for these art forms as well as music and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/10276591/Reykjavik-Iceland-a-cultural-city-guide.html|title=Reykjavik, Iceland: a cultural city guide|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than three hundred artists from around the world have participated in the festival, along with the artist-run galleries, the bigger museums and institutions in [[Iceland]]. 

For Sequences Art Festival in 2008 (held October 11 to 17) the curatorial board decided to acknowledge renowned artists for their notable contribution to real-time art mediums. The honorary artist of Sequences 2008 was the Icelandic artist ''Rúrí''.

The fourth Sequences Art Festival was held in 2009 (October 31 to November 7, 2009). The festival's honorary artist was the 80-year-old concept art legend Magnús Pálsson. Born in East-Iceland in 1929, Pálsson studied theatre design and art in the early 1950s and became an active participant in Iceland's embryonic avant-garde, collaborating with alternative theatre groups as well as with other artists such as Dieter Roth and later the SÚM-group of young artists that formed in 1965.

== History ==
Sequences was founded by four artist-run venues: [[The Living Art Museum]], ''Kling &amp; Bang Gallery'', ''The Dwarf Gallery'' and ''Gallery Bananananas'' (closed since 2007)—as well as the [[Center for Icelandic Art]] (CIA.IS). Each institute has a representative on the board, but all the major venues and cultural institutions in the greater-Reykjavík area have worked with the festival in one way or another. The first festivals in 2006-2008, were annual but in 2009 it was decided to slow the pace and hold the festival every other year.

For the first time, the Sequences Festival took place in different locations in the city center of [[Reykjavík]], accompanied by exhibitions and video / film nights. A total of 140 participants from 20 different countries showed their artwork at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequences.is/?page_id=7/ History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722021958/http://sequences.is/?page_id=7%2F |date=2011-07-22 }}.

In [[folklore]], a '''simpleton''' is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as '''noodles''', '''fools''', and '''gothamites'''.  Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] told tales of stupid populations in [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and other cities; in [[Germany]], men of [[Schilda]] are conspicuous in these stories; in [[Spain]] hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from [[Lepe]]; and in [[England]], the village of [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]] in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In [[Sri Lanka]] whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people.&lt;ref name='Noodles'&gt;{{cite book | last = Clouston | first = W. A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Book of Noodles: Stories of Simpletons; or, Fools and Their Follies | publisher = Elliot Stock | date = 1888 | location = London | pages = | url = http://sacred-texts.com/etc/bon/index.htm | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, [[Philogelos|Hierokles]] created such a collection. In England, the famous ''[[Joe Miller (actor)|Joe Miller's Jests]]'' is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Miller's Jests|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40127/40127-h/40127-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worstall|first=Tim|title=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/03/it-would-have-to-be-the-irish-newspapers-trying-something-insanely-stupid-like-charging-for-links-to-websites/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantwell|first=Billy|title=Irish Echo|url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/2011/07/17/comment-time-for-the-stupid-irish-joke-to-be-laid-to-rest/11036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and are the butt of [[An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]] jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Ireland]], [[Turkey]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Sicily]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt; 

Simpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. 

A very old such tale from England is&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.&lt;ref name='Gotham'&gt;{{cite book | last = Halliwell | first = James Orchard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Merry Tales of the Wise Men of Gotham | publisher = John Russell Smith | date = 1840 | location = London | pages = | url = http://www.presscom.co.uk/gotham.html | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A famous one from ancient Greece is&lt;blockquote&gt;A man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, "He had a cough."&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Snow at Argenteuil'''''  ({{lang-fr|Rue sous la neige, Argenteuil}}) is an oil-on-canvas [[Landscape art|landscape painting]] from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. It is the largest of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of [[Argenteuil]]  while it was under a blanket of snow during the winter of 1874–1875. This painting—number&amp;nbsp;352 in Wildenstein’s catalogue of the works of Monet—is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.&lt;ref&gt;The Simon Sainsbury Bequest to Tate and The National Gallery. Edited by Andrew Wilson. Tate Publishing, a division of Tate Enterprises Ltd., Millbank, London SW1P&amp;nbsp;4RG. 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-85437-790-6}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;48,&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Monet’s ''Snow at Argenteuil'' pictures from the winter of 1874–1875 were painted from locations close to the house on the boulevard&amp;nbsp;Saint-Denis (now number 21&amp;nbsp;boulevard&amp;nbsp;Karl Marx) into which Monet and his family had just moved. This particular painting shows the boulevard Saint-Denis looking in the direction of the junction with the rue&amp;nbsp;de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Voie-des-Bans, with the river Seine out of sight to the rear, and the local railway station behind Monet’s back as he painted.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery Review of the Year.

In December 1879 the painting was acquired from Monet by Théodore Duret. Recalling a conversation with the artist [[Édouard&amp;nbsp;Manet]], Duret years later reported that, ‘One winter he [''Manet''] wanted to paint a snow scene. I had in my possession just such a piece from Monet. After seeing it, he said “It is perfect! I would not know how to do better”, whereupon he gave up painting snow.’{{Cref2|A}}&lt;ref&gt;Histoire de Édouard Manet et&amp;nbsp;de&amp;nbsp;son œuvre. Théodore Duret.

''Le Plein Air'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was acquired from Duret by the art dealers [[Goupil &amp; Cie|Boussod, Valadon et Cie]] of Paris in 1892; then by Harris Whittemore of Naugatuck, Connecticut in 1893. Acquavella Galleries of New York acquired the painting in the early 1970s, and then it was purchased by [[Simon Sainsbury]] in or around 1973. It was bequeathed by him to the National Gallery, London, in 2006 and it has remained there since.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Monet. Biographie et catalogue raisonné. Tome Ⅰ : 1840–1881. Peintures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11334">'''Social sculpture''' is a phrase to describe an expanded concept of [[art]] that was invented by the artist and co-founder of the German Green Party, [[Joseph Beuys]]. Beuys created the term "social sculpture" to embody his understanding of art's potential to transform society. As a work of art, a social sculpture includes human activity that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. The central idea of a social sculptor is an artist who creates structures in society using language, thoughts, actions, and objects.

== Concept ==

[[Image:7thousand oaks.jpg|thumb|200px|Some of the [[7000 Oaks|7,000 Oaks]] planted between 1982 and 1987 for Documenta 7 (1982)]]
During the 1960s, Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art. Indebted to Romantic writers such as [[Novalis]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the social ideas of [[anthroposophy]] and the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys' formulation of the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys' most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is "Everyone is an artist"). In the video "Willoughby SHARP,'' Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues'' (1974/120 min)", a record of Beuys' first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful.  In 1973, Beuys wrote:

: ''"Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."''&lt;ref&gt;Beuys statement dated 1973, first published in English in Caroline Tisdall: Art into Society, Society into Art (ICA, London, 1974), p.48. Capitals in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was invited to create a work for [[Documenta]] 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above, one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. [[7000 Oaks|7,000 oak trees]] were then planted in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, ''Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet'', 2005 p.42 {{ISBN|0-9647280-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory.

In 1991, "[[The Thing (art project)|The Thing]]" took its inspiration from the concept of social sculpture.

In 2007, at [[Documenta|Documenta 12]], Kirill Preobrazhenskiy created work "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio". His work was compared by critics with Beuys' oaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,488870,00.html Spiegel]:

Some of the art at this year's Documenta has escaped the confines of the exhibition halls and intervened in Kassel's public spaces -- like Kirill Preobrazhenskiy's "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio," a sound installation played on a busy public transportation route.

This strategy has been tried before, though. From 1982 through 1987, Joseph Beuys came to Kassel and planted 7,000 trees alongside slabs of stone as part of an installation called "7,000 Oaks," for Documenta 7. Visitors still snap photos of the trees, which have become an internationally renowned work of art. Kassel residents rarely take a second glance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite==
The "Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite" was founded by the artists Joseph Beuys, Johannes Stüttgen and Karl Fastabend on June 19, 1971 in Düsseldorf as a political organization. The goal was influencing social patterns with implementing Beuys' concept of the extended notion of art and the social sculpture via political means. Today,{{when|date=January 2016}} Johannes Stüttgen spread the idea for direct democracy with the project "Omnibus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnibus.org/fileadmin/omnibus.org/PDF/Sonstiges/4_Seiter_2008_engl_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual ==
Beuys believed everybody was an artist. He once said "every sphere of human activity, even peeling a potato can be a work of art as long as it is a conscious act," the idea being that every decision you make should be thought out and attempt to make or contribute to a work of art which in the end is society.  Individuality and well-educated decisions are promoted in the person while the government is made of those decisions put into referendums.  This point of view invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that they are an important part of a whole not only an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Danto, Mcevilley.

'''''St Mary Magdalene Reading''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Piero di Cosimo]]. It is housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]] of [[Palazzo Barberini]], [[Rome]]. 

==Description==
The work depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] at a window-like table, reading a bible. On the shelf is a bottle of unguent. She is dressed in a contemporary multicolor gown and cape; she is distinguished by her long curled hair draping over her shoulders. She wears a ring of pearls in her hair. Around her hair a filigree of a halo. On the sill is the painter's signature. The use of shadows to give dimension to the face, and the settled pose of the Magdalen, identify the work as emerging from Piero di Cosimo's late works, influence by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/141/piero-di-cosimo-santa-maria-maddalena Entry at Galleria Nazionale].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bucket List''''' is a 2007 [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] [[film]] directed and produced by [[Rob Reiner]], written by [[Justin Zackham]], and starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/658339/Bucket-List-The/full-credits.html|title=The Bucket List|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main plot follows two [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] men on their [[road trip]] with a [[wish list]] of things to do before they "[[kick the bucket]]".

The film premiered on December 15, 2007 in [[Hollywood]] and opened in [[limited release]] in the United States on December 25, 2007, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film then had a wide release on January 11, 2008. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2007#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2007]] and was a box office success, grossing $175 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Two men, [[blue-collar]] mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman) and billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cole (Nicholson) meet for the first time in the hospital after both have been diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]. 

Carter is a gifted amateur historian and family man who wanted to become a history professor in his youth but never rose above his status as a mechanic. Edward is a four-time divorced health-care tycoon and cultured loner who enjoys tormenting his personal valet/servant, Thomas ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]), who later reveals his name is actually Matthew. Edward enjoys drinking [[Kopi Luwak]], one of the most expensive coffees in the world.

During their time in the ward, Carter and Edward find common ground. Carter begins writing a "bucket list", or things to do before he "[[kick the bucket|kicks the bucket]]". After hearing he has less than a year, Carter discards the list. Edward finds it the next morning and urges Carter to do everything on the list, offering to finance the trip for both of them. Carter agrees and despite the protests of his wife, Virginia ([[Beverly Todd]]), Edward and Carter begin their around-the-world vacation. They go skydiving, drive a [[Shelby Mustang]], fly over the [[North Pole]], eat dinner at [[Chevre_d%27or|Chevre d'or]] in [[France]], visit and praise the beauty and history of [[Taj Mahal]], [[India]], ride motorcycles on the [[Great Wall of China]], attend a lion [[safari]] in [[Tanzania]], and visit the base of [[Mt. Everest]] in [[Nepal]].

Atop the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]], looking out over the pyramids of [[Pyramid of Khafre|Khafre]] and [[Pyramid of Menkaure|Menkaure]], they confide about faith and family, revealing that Carter has long been feeling less in love with his wife and that Edward is deeply hurt by his estrangement from his only daughter, who disowned him after he drove away her [[domestic violence|abusive]] husband. In [[Hong Kong]], Edward hires a prostitute for Carter, who has never been with any woman but his wife. Carter declines and realizing that he loves his wife, asks to return home. 

On the drive back, Carter reciprocates by trying to reunite Edward with his daughter. Believing it is a breach of trust, Edward angrily storms off. Carter returns home to his family while Edward stays home alone. However, the family reunion is short-lived: Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to the hospital, the cancer having spread to his brain.

Edward, who is now in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], visits him and they share a few moments, wherein Carter reveals how Edward's Kopi Luwak coffee is grown in [[Sumatra]] and then fed to and defecated by a [[Asian palm civet|jungle cat]] before being harvested because of the special aroma of the gastric juices. Carter crosses off "laugh till I cry" from his bucket list and insists Edward finish the list without him. Carter then undergoes surgery but dies on the operating table. 

As news of Carter's death is given to his wife and family, Edward attempts to reconcile with his own daughter. She accepts him back into her life and introduces him to the granddaughter he never knew he had. After greeting the little girl with a kiss on the cheek, Edward crosses "kiss the most beautiful girl in the world" off the list. Edward delivers a eulogy at Carter's funeral, during which he explains that the last three months of Carter's life were the best three months of his life and crosses "help a complete stranger for the good" off the list.

The epilogue reveals that Edward lived until age 81, and his ashes were then taken to the summit of a peak in the [[Himalayas]] by his assistant Matthew. As Matthew places a [[Chock full o'Nuts]] coffee can alongside another can, he crosses off the last item on the bucket list ("witness something truly majestic") and places it between the cans. Carter's narration reveals that the two cans contain their ashes and that Edward would have loved this, because he was "buried on the mountain and that was against the law".

A [[film score|score]] album from Varèse Sarabande was released on January 15, 2008, featuring composer [[Marc Shaiman]]'s original score for the film as well as a selection of newly recorded themes from Shaiman's previous scoring projects, including ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Simon Birch]]'', ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'', ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'', ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', ''[[South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'', and ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]''. It also features a rearranged version of the [[James Bond]] theme "[[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]]" (titled "Printmaster"), with Shaiman's own voice and lyrics in which he spoofs the industry's habit of tracking music in scenes where they don't belong.

'''''The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them''''' is a [[non-fiction]] [[1999 in literature|1999]] book written by The Freedom Writers, a group of students from [[Wilson Classical High School|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Long Beach, California]], and their teacher [[Erin Gruwell]]. It is the basis of the [[2007 in film|2007]] movie ''[[Freedom Writers]]'', starring [[Hilary Swank]].

The Freedom Writers Diary was made up of journals that Erin Gruwell told her students to write in about the troubles of their past, present and future. The Freedom Writers name pays homage to the name of the 1960s civil rights group [[Freedom Riders]].

After intercepting a racist drawing from one of her students, Gruwell compared the drawings to Nazi propaganda techniques. She drew blank stares; only one of them had heard of [[the Holocaust]]. As a result, she assigned them to read and write about ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and ''[[Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo]]''.&lt;ref name="writers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/watercooler/ci_8382634|title=""Freedom Writers" tale inspires students"|publisher=www.denverpost.com|accessdate=2008-03-26|first=Tom|last=McGhee|date=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freedom Writers Foundation]] continued with exercises and philosophies similar to those used in the original class, and tracks the progress of the original and continuing classes.

==Plot summary==
As an idealistic 23-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell confronted a room of "unteachable, at-risk" students. One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Jewish [[Holocaust]] – only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books ''Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl'' and ''Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo'' as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels between these books and their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the "Freedom Writers" in homage to the civil rights activists "The Freedom Riders".

With funds raised by a "Read-a-thon for Tolerance", they arranged for [[Miep Gies]], the Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California during the 1994/1995 school year, where she declared that Erin Gruwell's students were "the real heroes". Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition – appearances on ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'', coverage in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]], a meeting with [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Richard Riley]] – and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers graduated from high school and many went on to attend college.

==Banning of the book in schools==
On March 11, 2008, an English teacher at [[Perry Meridian High School]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], Connie Heermann, was suspended for a year and a half without pay for using the ''Freedom Writers Diary'' in her classroom against the wishes of the school board.&lt;ref name="suspended"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23785066/|title=Teacher suspended over controversial book|publisher=www.msnbc.com|accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080330003824/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23785066/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://detentionslip.org/2008/06/teacher-banned-for-using-freedom.html Teacher banned for using 'Freedom Writers' book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926051011/http://detentionslip.org/2008/06/teacher-banned-for-using-freedom.html |date=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrators objected to racial slurs and sexual content in portions of the book.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080313/LOCAL1801/303130015|title='Freedom  Writers' founder defends high school teacher|publisher=www.indystar.com|accessdate=2008-03-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">'''The GIMP Project''' is a New-York based modern dance project by the [[Heidi Latsky Dance]] company, and originally produced by Jeremy Alliger of Alliger Arts. Heidi Latsky choreographs work for four professional dancers and four dancers with physical disabilities, who perform [[Physically integrated dance|integrated dance]] pieces.

==Origins of the Project==
Heidi Latsky has had a longtime interest in dance that pushes beyond conventional boundaries. She is a former dancer in the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]], and has danced with [[Larry Goldhuber]], a dancer with large "physical proportions".{{sfn|Goodley|Hughes|Davis|2012}} Latsky has also trained actors in movement techniques for over 20 years.

GIMP has the goal of combining dancers of all "corporealities", making both disabled and able-bodied dancers objects of spectacle.{{sfn|McRuer|Mollow|2012|pp=394–395}} Latsky's plans for GIMP include adding to its body of work over "the next 5–10 years".

The name of the company is one meant to challenge stereotypes of physical disability. The GIMP Project's website provides the following definitions of the term "{{linktext|gimp}}": {{blockquote|
# a ribbonlike, braided fabric
# fighting spirit; vigor
# a lame person
# slang; a halting, lame walk
# to turn, vacillate, tremble ecstatically&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web |title=In brief |url=http://www.thegimpproject.com/gimp/brief/ |publisher=The GIMP Project |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

An outreach program is part of the GIMP performances. This brings an educational component to the project's work. According to the project's Website, the outreach program currently includes:{{blockquote|
* A diversity of articulate voices (a ready-made panel discussion)
*A genre-shattering showcase of cutting edge disability film (no handkerchief necessary, no heroism required!)
* A choreographer who is also a degreed psychologist
* A national disability advocate and lecturer
* A choreographer celebrated for setting work on local dancers
* A dancer with expertise working with HIV communities&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; }}

==Reception==
In 2009, Theodore Bale wrote in ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' of the confrontational aspect of Latsky's approach: {{blockquote|the dancers in ''GIMP'' ... make the situation reciprocal. They stare back at you. Subverting these well-established "polite" conventions of gaze is the starting point for this event, which skillfully blends political inquiry, psychology, and aesthetic explorations of form, structure and dynamics. ''GIMP'' is without doubt a gleaming milestone in the progress of contemporary dance and theater, making "disabled dancer" an oxymoron.&lt;ref name="Gale-quote"/&gt; }}

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Corey Kilgannon quotes dancer Lawrence Carter-Long explaining the GIMP approach: "This is no safe prearranged marriage of dance and disability [...] This is a collision. This is two worlds coming together that ain't supposed to co-exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgannon |first=Corey |title=Confronting Disability with Modern Dance |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/confronting-disability-with-modern-dance/ |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIMP Project tours in major cities of the United States, and performs at such New York City theater institutions as the [[Lincoln Center]].

'''''View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm''''', commonly known as '''''The Oxbow''''', is a seminal landscape [[painting]] by [[Thomas Cole]], founder of the [[Hudson River School]]. The painting depicts a Romantic panorama of the Connecticut River Valley just after a thunderstorm. It has been interpreted as a confrontation between wilderness and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Angela|title=The Empire of the Eye|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=0-8014-2830-0|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Background==
Between 1833 and 1836, American painter and putative "founder" of ''The Hudson River School,'' Thomas Cole, had been hard at work on his series of paintings ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]''. The work was commissioned by New York patron [[Luman Reed]], who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested ''The Course of Empire'' to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in by the end of 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on ''The Course of Empire'' and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the [[National Academy of Design]]'s annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, ''The Pastoral State''. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing:&lt;ref name=met&gt;Roque, Oswaldo Rodriguez (1982). ''"The Oxbow" by Thomas Cole: Iconography of an American Landscape Painting''. Metropolitan Museum Journal. pp. 63–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Fancy pictures]] seldom sell &amp; they generally take more time than views so I have determined to paint one of the latter.  I have already commenced a view from [[Mount Holyoke|Mt. Holyoke]]&amp;mdash;it is about the finest scene I have in my sketchbook &amp; is well known&amp;mdash;it will be novel and I think effective&amp;mdash;I could not find a subject very similar to your second picture &amp; time would not allow me to invent one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cole also comments that he used a larger canvas, as he was not able to ready a smaller frame in time for the exhibition, and moreover felt compelled to make a statement with the one painting he was to present.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==Composition==
The painting moves from a dark wilderness with shattered tree trunks on rugged cliffs in the foreground covered with violent rain clouds on the left to a light-filled and peaceful, cultivated landscape on the right, which borders the tranquility of the bending [[Connecticut River]]. In returning to painting landscapes, Cole was faced with the dichotomy of the untamed wilderness and land cultivated by man. While other painters of the [[Hudson River School]] would merge the two peacefully, Cole did not shy away from portraying the two as opposites and showing how the cultivation would destroy the natural wilderness, and as a result never meet in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, James T (1998). ''Random Harvest''. Fordham University Press. p. 145. {{ISBN|0-8232-1731-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the hill in the far background, logging scars in the forest can be observed, which appear to form [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]]. This was first noticed by Matthew Baigell long after the landscape was painted. It reads as [[Noah]] (נֹ֫חַ) If viewed upside down, as if from God's perspective, the word ''[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]'' is formed, "The Almighty." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/downloads/pdfs/Resource_Guide_Chapters/PictAmer_Resource_Book_Chapter_5A.pdf|title=View from Mount Holyoke (The Oxbow), 1836|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole gives himself a tiny [[self-portrait]] sitting on the rocks in the foreground with his easel.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmerding, John (2003). ''Signs of the Artist: Signatures and Self-expression in American Paintings''. Yale University Press. p. 58. {{ISBN|0-300-09779-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Cole sold the painting at the exhibition to Charles Nicoll Talbot (1802–1874), merchant in the [[Economic history of China|China trade]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bjelajac, "Thomas Cole's ''Oxbow'' and the American Zion Divided", ''American Art'' '''20''' (2006), pp60–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838 he lent it to the Dunlap Benefit Exhibition, and later to the third annual exhibition of the Artists' Fund Society, which was held in New York in 1862. With his death in 1874, the painting was acquired from his estate by [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]], wife of [[Russell Sage]]. Olivia Sage was a known philanthropist, and her transfer of ''The Oxbow'' to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1908 would seem rather natural.  However, she may have been inspired by a similar gesture in 1904 by Samuel P. Avery, Jr., who donated ''[[The Titan's Goblet]]'', another of Cole's well-known paintings, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Furthermore, Olivia Sage's attorney, [[Robert W. DeForest]], was a secretary on the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum. The painting today resides in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Parry III, Ellwood C (2003).

'''''The Quack Doctor''''' is a panel painting by the [[Golden Age of Dutch painting|Dutch]] artist [[Gerrit Dou]] from 1652. It depicts a crowd gathered around a [[quackery|quack]] doctor as he promotes his wares.  Dou also paints himself leaning out the window with a palette in hand. By including himself in the composition, he contrasts the deceptions involved in painting with those of quack medicine. For Dou, the composition was a departure; he was known for niche pieces, which depict an interior framed by a window. The painting has been written about quite extensively and is among the best-known treatments of its subject.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135495749 |editor-last=Muller |editor-first=Sheila D. |pages=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes of quack doctors (''kwakzolvers'') represented folly and were a common topic in Dutch [[genre painting]], by artists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Jan Victors]], and [[Jan Miense Molenaer]]. Genre scenes of ''kwaksolvers'' might  depict them performing surgery to the legs, feet, or head (removing the "[[stone of folly]]"), extracting teeth, and offering [[patent medicine]]s. 

The painting's symbolism confirms the futility of the quack's offerings. The people are portrayed as gullible, except for those who mirror the quack's deceit: the boy at far right picks the pocket of a woman, and another boy lures a bird. The painting's details would be familiar to its audience from [[emblem book]]s or proverbs. A woman wiping her child's bottom alludes to the nature of the quack's offerings. She is a seller of pancakes, which sound when cooking like the chatter of the mountebank. His oversized diploma would be seen as fake. The scene takes place during a fair, when laws and guild regulations were loosened, and outside merchants had the freedom to sell their wares. The fair is announced by the poster at right, and the man carrying a dead hare shows the loosening of hunting laws.&lt;ref name="gaskell"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaskell |first=Ivan |date=1982 |title=Gerrit Dou, His Patrons and the Art of Painting |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360100 |journal=Oxford Art Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dou's picture is a large work for him, perhaps indicating its importance to the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Alchemical Mercury: A Theory of Ambivalence |last=Pinkus |first=Karen |date=2009 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804772877 |pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location can be determined by the town gate, windmill,  and bridge in the background: this is Dou's studio in Galgewater, [[Leiden]]. The setting highlights Dou's intent to compare the deceptions of the painter, imitator of reality, with those of the quack.&lt;ref name="gaskell"/&gt; Dou may be comforting his higher-class audience by suggesting that they are above the pictured fray, or he may be expressing reservations about his own occupation's use of deception. Dou was an excellent ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' painter. The composition includes a living tree and a dead tree—a familiar motif of choice—perhaps implying that only the artistic use of deceit is morally permissible.

'''''The Snake Charmer''''' (French: ''La Charmeuse de serpents'') is a 1907 oil painting by French [[Naïve art|Naïve]] artist [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910). It is a depiction of a woman with glowing eyes playing a flute in the moonlight by the edge of a dark jungle with a snake extending toward her from a nearby tree.

==History==
''The Snake Charmer'' was commissioned by Berthe, Comtesse de Delaunay, the mother of artist [[Robert Delaunay]]. It was Rousseau's first large commission and was exhibited in the 1907 [[Autumn Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsaneva|first=Maria|title=Henri Rousseau: 112 Paintings|year=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=978-1-304-90165-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_2798_300061975.pdf |last=Rich |first=Daniel Catton |title=Henri Rousseau |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rousseau never traveled outside of France, the exotic plants in the painting resulted from Rousseau's visits to the [[Jardin des plantes]] and from magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magi|first=Giovanna|title=Grande Louvre e il Museo d'Orsay, il|year=1998|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-7009-780-1|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1922 to 1936, ''The Snake Charmer'' was in the collection of [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]]. It was promised to the Louvre in 1925 and became part of its collection in 1937.&lt;ref name=d'orsay /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Peter |title=At Tate Modern |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n01/peter-campbell/at-tate-modern |website=London Review of Books |accessdate=15 November 2018 |pages=24 |date=5 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting has an asymmetric vertical composition with a detailed depiction of the jungle on the right and a woman playing the flute on the left, back-lit by the moon. A snake, charmed by the music, stretches horizontally across the painting. The [[Musée d'Orsay]] described the painting as "a black Eve in a disquieting Garden of Eden".&lt;ref name=d'orsay&gt;{{cite web |title=Musée d'Orsay: Henri Rousseau, called Le Douanier The Snake Charmer |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/the-snake-charmer-8959.html?no_cache=1 |website=www.musee-orsay.fr |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sybin 1849.JPG|thumb|250px|Fragment of ''Transylvanian Panorama'' - Tarnów Museum]]
The '''''Transylvanian Panorama''''' (Polish: Panorama Siedmiogrodzka) other names ''Bem and Petőfi'', ''Bem in Transylvania'', ''Battle of Segesvár / Schässburg - village of Fehéregyháza, meaning White Church''was a monumental (15 × 100 metre) [[panorama|panoramic]] [[painting]] depicting the Battle of [[Sibiu|Nagyszeben]], during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848-49]].

== History ==

The idea came from the Hungarians who wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[Revolutions of 1848-49]]. It was painted by many painters under the direction of [[Jan Styka]] in the [[Lwów]] (Lviv) rotunda, located in Stryjski Park, the same place where the [[Racławice Panorama]] was painted. The project was finished in September 1897 by painters of three nations:

*Hungarian: [[Tihamér Margitay]], [[Pál Vágó]] and [[Béla Spányi]],
*Polish: [[Tadeusz Popiel]], [[Zygmunt Rozwadowski]], [[Michał Gorstkin-Wywiórski]],
*and the German painter [[Leopold Schönchen]]. 

The painting was exhibited in Lwow, [[Budapest]] and [[Warsaw]]. It was cut into 100 pieces but only 31 of them now survive. Twenty fragments currently are located in a few Polish museums in [[Tarnów]], [[Warsaw]], [[Krosno]] and [[Łęczyca]]. Another 11 pieces are in private collections in Poland and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Kwartalnik: "Cenne, bezcenne, utracone" nr 2(51) kwiecień-czerwiec 2007, A. Majcherek-Węgrzynek "Panorama Siedmiogrodzka - fragmenty zlokalizowane poza granicami Polski"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Sibiu was fought on 11 March 1849 between the Hungarian Transylvanian Army led by the Polish general [[Józef Bem]] and the coalition of [[Austria]]n and [[Russia]]n armies commanded by Generals [[Anton Puchner]] and [[Grigory Skariatin]].

Russell Museum's]] "The Russell" art sale, the Western Heritage Artists Association Art Show, the Jay Contway and Friends Art Show, March in Montana (an art show and auction presented by the Coeur d'Alene Art Auction and Manitou Galleries), a Montana version of the Wild Bunch Art Show, and the Western Masters Art Show.&lt;ref name="Aids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EckeManyChanges"&gt;Ecke, Richard.

March 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The event draws bidders and artists from around the world, and the travel guide ''[[Frommer's]]'' has called it one of the finest Western auctions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Eric. ''Frommer's Montana &amp; Wyoming.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source has said the event "is widely regarded as the nation's largest and finest auction of original western art of the 19th and 20th centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Gottberg, John; Harris, Richard; and Haselsteiner, Fran. ''Hidden Rockies: The Adventurer's Guide.'' Berkeley, Calif.: Ulysses Press, 1995, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Western Art Week was founded in 1969.&lt;ref name="Newhouse"&gt;[http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20100316/NEWS01/3160304/0/NEWS01&amp;theme=WAR/Museum++Ad+Club+both+had+to+scramble Newhouse, Eric. "Museum, Ad Club Both Had to Scramble."] ''[[Great Falls Tribune]].'' March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The event was built around the C.M. Russell Art Auction, which was founded by local television personality and civic booster [[Norma Ashby]] to benefit the C.M. Russell Museum.&lt;ref name="Newhouse" /&gt; The C.M. Russell Art Auction raised more than $5.6 million for the museum between 1969 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Newhouse" /&gt; The Western Heritage Artists Association Art Show was added in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;"Art Fans Converge Here for Western Art Week." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Native American Art Show in 1982.&lt;ref name="Aids" /&gt; The Jay Contway art show (sponsored by a local artist) became part of Western Art Week in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20100316/ENTERTAINMENT/3120371/0/NEWS01&amp;theme=WAR/Contway+event+returns+for+25th+year Newhouse, Eric. "Contway Event Returns for 25th Year."] ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Manitou Galleries began hosting the concurrent "March in Montana" art event in 2007,&lt;ref name="Aids" /&gt; although the gallery had been holding auctions during Western Art Week since 1982.&lt;ref name="McGarry" /&gt; As of 2007, Western Art Week was one of the largest events held in the city of Great Falls each year.&lt;ref&gt;Fanselow, Julie. ''Traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail.'' Guilford, Conn.: Falcon Guides, 2007, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the C.M. Russell Museum and the Great Falls Ad Club (a nonprofit organization of local business owners dedicated to promoting the local economy) ended their joint sponsorship of the C.M. Russell Art Auction.&lt;ref&gt;"Mont. Museum to Hold Art Show in March." ''Associated Press.'' September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Separate"&gt;"Russell Museum, Ad Club Plan Separate Art Auctions." ''[[Associated Press]].'' September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Ad Club continued to hold the auction, the museum established a new event, "The Russell" art auction, whose sole beneficiary will be the C.M. Russell Museum.&lt;ref name="Separate" /&gt; Many local leaders and artists worried that the competing shows would hurt both organizations and lead to much lower sales.  However, in April 2010 the C.M. Russell Museum said that it had net proceeds of $605,473 from its March 2010 event, compared to just $120,829 from the jointly-run 2009 effort.&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Russell Museum Nets $605,473 From Art Week Events." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum announced it would continue to hold the separate "The Russell" auction in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Museum, Ad Club Will Continue Separate Auctions in 2011." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Russell" auction ($1.57 million) just edged out the March in Montana show ($1.45 million) in total gross sales.&lt;ref name="EckeManyChanges" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "New Art in Action Packs House." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ad Club discontinued the C.M. Russell Art Auction after the March 2010 event.&lt;ref name="EckeCapacityCrowd"&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Western Art Week Organizers Await Capacity Crowd." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KRTVPrepares"&gt;[http://www.krtv.com/news/great-falls-prepares-for-western-art-week/ Stukey, Katie. "Great Falls Prepares for Western Art Week." KRTV.com. February 28, 2011.] Accessed 2011-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Bigfork, Montana]], natives Steve Cawdrey and Pat Hagan co-founded a new art auction, the Western Masters Art Show and Sale, to replace the former event.&lt;ref name="KRTVPrepares" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennion"&gt;Kimball, Bennion. "Western Masters Auction Keeps Tradition Alive." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also discontinued in 2011 was the Native American Art Show (although many of the artists and organizers joined the Contway show).&lt;ref name="EckeManyChanges" /&gt; Another new art show, the Wild Bunch Art Show, also started operations in 2011.&lt;ref name="EckeManyChanges" /&gt; (Wild Bunch Art Shows are also held in [[Glasgow, Montana]], and [[Williston, North Dakota]].)&lt;ref name="EckeCapacityCrowd" /&gt; 

===2011 Western Art Week===
Organizers of the various art shows and auctions said they experienced improved cooperation by all Western Art Week participants in 2011.&lt;ref name="EckeCapacityCrowd" /&gt; [[Ree Drummond]], author of the [[blog]] "The Pioneer Woman," was a special speaker at the 2011 Western Art Week and signed copies of her newly released book, ''Black Heels to Tractor Wheels.''&lt;ref name="EckeCapacityCrowd" /&gt; "The Russell" auction had sales of $1.35 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmrussell.org/the-russell/russell-sales-results "Sales Results." C.M. Russell Museum. April 2011.] Accessed 2011-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and Russell's watercolor, ''Bronco Buster'', sold for $200,000.&lt;ref name="EckePace"&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Museum Keeps Pace Despite Changes and Turmoil Around World." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This was below estimates (set at $240,000 to $280,000),&lt;ref name="EckeCapacityCrowd" /&gt; but 80 percent higher than what the piece sold for in 2003 when auctioned by [[Christie's]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Western Art Auctions Off Slightly But Russell Piece Sells for $200,000." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales at the March in Montana auction were about $1.3 million.&lt;ref name="EckePace" /&gt; The ''Great Falls Tribune'' said the new Western Masters Art Show was slightly larger than the C.M. Russell Auction held in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Ecke, Richard. "Western Art Week: New Shows Out of the Chutes." ''Great Falls Tribune.'' March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Half the sales from the Western Masters Art Show's "quick finish" event&lt;ref&gt;In this event, artists are given a single hour to finish a painting or drawing they have already begun. The final works are then auctioned off.&lt;/ref&gt; benefited the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagan was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2009.  The 2001 "quick finish" event raised $46,000 for the foundation. See: Kimball, "Western Masters Auction Keeps Tradition Alive," ''Great Falls Tribune,'' March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{broader|The Queen's Beasts}}
The '''White Greyhound of Richmond''' is one of the [[Queen's Beasts]] commissioned for display at the coronation of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1953. A stone copy can also be found in the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]].
[[File:Tudor Rose, royally crowned.svg|thumb|left|frame|The Tudor Rose, royally crowned.]]

According to the ''[[Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society]]'':

"The White Greyhound of Richmond bears a shield of Tudor livery, white and green, with a Tudor Rose ensigned by a Royal Crown. Henry VII sometimes used greyhounds as supporters and on his standards. His father, Edmund Tudor, was created Earl of Richmond and the white greyhound was associated with the Honour of Richmond. The rose in the badge shows the association of the red and the white elements of Lancaster and York respectively, emphasising the union of the rival houses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cuhags.soc.srcf.net/escutcheon/03-2.html#the-queen%E2%80%99s-beasts|title = Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society|last = Jøhndal|first = Marius|website = cuhags.soc.srcf.net|access-date = 2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a badge held by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] during his tenure as steward/earl of the [[Honour of Richmond]], it was the canine breed most favoured in [[Northern England]].  This animal was further used for [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]] and [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]] and is supposed to stand for the honour, regardless of who has held or been in charge of it, although [[Peter II, Count of Savoy]] was not known to have any unique symbol to depict his stewardship of Richmond.  Although they were legitimately entitled to the feudal estate, the badge was not used by any [[Duke of Brittany]], preferring to use their traditional ermine until [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] willed Richmond to [[Henry VII of England]]—the chief representative of the [[House of Lancaster]], which simultaneously legitimised the title to the [[Tudor dynasty]] and reversed the effect of the attainder made by [[Richard III of England]] as chief representative of the [[House of York]] and swung the loyalty of [[Richmondshire]] against the Ricardian regime, rolling back [[jure uxoris]] control through the marriages to [[Cecily Neville]], [[Anne Neville]] and [[Isabella Neville]], as descendants of the Nevilles who held [[Middleham]].  Henry VII subsequently replaced the English lion with the White Greyhound, in the [[coat of arms of England]], opposite the [[Y Ddraig Goch]] of Wales.  Like the Red Dragon, the White Greyhound represents the ancient [[Brython]]s, although more specifically of the [[Breton people|Breton element]] which had become resettled since the [[Harrying of the North]] in 1071.
