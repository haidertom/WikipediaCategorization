'''Alban Schachleiter''' (20 January 1861 – 20 June 1937) was a Roman Catholic [[Benedictine]] monk and musicologist. He was closely associated with the [[Nazis]], and with [[Adolf Hitler]] personally.

Schachleiter first became closely associated  with the NSDAP, and with Hitler, in late 1922. Originally from Mainz, he served as the long-time abbot of the [[Emmaus monastery|Emmaus]] monastery in Prague before being forced out of that position in late 1918 following the establishment of the new Czechoslovak state.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After brief stays at several Austrian monasteries, including St. Florian near [[Linz]], by early 1920 he was at Munich's [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|St. Boniface's Abbey]].  By September 1922 he was noticed for the radicalism of his anti-Semitic agitation and his involvement with groups like the ''volkisch'' Bund Bayern und Reich.  He cultivated connections with members of Munich's Catholic elite, including [[w:de:Karl Alexander von Müller]], professor of history at the University of Munich, and Helene Raff, whose father was the composer [[Joachim Raff]]. With Muller he discussed politics and [[Gregorian chant]]. Through these connections he first met Hitler in late 1922; the pair were observed by both Muller and [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] engaging in lively and lengthy conversation.  It was the beginning of a relationship that ended only with Schachleiter's death in 1937. The meeting opened the way for Schachleiter to play an important propagandist role on behalf of the NSDAP in the summer of 1923.

Following the commemorative activities of 10 June 1923—which included a massive rally in honour  of [[Albert Leo Schlageter]], staged on [[Königsplatz, Munich|Munich's Konigsplatz]] and attended by 20-30000 activists—a Catholic memorial Mass was held immediately after the rally in St. Boniface Abbey, organised exclusively by the NSDAP, which was presided over by Schachleiter. Hanfstaengl had sketched out for Hitler the symbolic impact a related Catholic-Nazi Mass for Schlagater would have on Munich's Catholic population—Schachleiter could also consecrate the standards of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]. Hitler quickly agreed. Schachleiter delivered a eulogistic sermon that was remembered as having a powerful impact—a young and devoutly pious [[Heinrich Himmler]] joined the NSDAP in the wake of Schachleiters eulogy.&lt;ref&gt;Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism, Hastings p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later however, Schachleiter was writing to [[Oswald Spengler]] lamenting the impact of [[Erich Ludendorff]] and his anti-Catholic followers on the movement: following the refounding of the NSDAP in early 1925 the stronghold of the Nazi movement in Bavaria would no longer be Munich but rather the Protestant regions of [[Middle Franconia|Mittel]]- and [[Oberfranken]]. Schachleiter increasingly distanced himself  from the NSDAP in the mid-1920s, although he maintained an idealised image of Hitler personally.

Schachleiter continued for years to be angry at Ludendorff's anti-Catholic crusade following the [[Beer Hall putsch|putsch]] of November 1923. After maintaining his weekly Schola Gregoriana at the [[Allerheiligen-Hofkirche]] in Munich until 1930, he then moved to a newly built country house in Bad Feilnbach where he was still living when Hitler came to power in 1933. In late spring Schachleiter wrote to [[Michael von Faulhaber|Cardinal Faulhaber]]: "It seems to me to be a catastrophe that the Holy Church stands aloof from the new freedom movement, whose triumph I foresaw, and that the massive uprising of the  ''volk'', which is now lifting our poor fatherland out of its misery and shame, may well go down in history as a triumph of [[Protestantism]]." &lt;ref&gt;Derek Hastings, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Faulhaber forbade Schachleiter from performing Masses within the archdiocese, and Schachleiter reluctantly refused Hitler's request for him to come to Berlin on 20 March 1933 to perform a personal Mass for the fuhrer. Hitler  visited in mid-May to personally congratulate Schachleiter on his 50th anniversary as a Benedictine. His invitation to sit among the Nazi dignitaries at the [[Nuremberg]] party rally in 1934, which he accepted, (and an enduring image through [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''), showed him "on the sidelines as the Nazis' striking, yet thoroughly secularized, performative aesthetic played out before him." &lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.172&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1933-1936 Schachleiter spent much energy campaigning against what he saw as peripheral Nazi personalities directing the Nazis in an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian direction—and particularly the ideology advanced by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. Schachleiter regarded this as a restraint on a renewal of wide-ranging Catholic support for the NSDAP. Schachleiter eventually wrote more than two dozen appeals to a variety of Nazi officials, including [[Hans Lammers]], but was ignored. In September 1936 he admitted privately to a friend that, "a believing Christian can no longer participate [in the NSDAP]; they do not want believing Christians in the party." Publicly he continued to profess loyalty to the Führer and to the church.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following his death in June 1937 the Nazis ordered a state funeral arranged by Bavarian minister-president [[Ludwig Siebert (Nazi)|Ludwig Siebert]]. A year later the editorial leadership of the ''[[Münchener Beobachter|Beobachter]]'' refused attempts to publish official commemorations. According to historian Derek Hastings, by 1937 Schachleiter's vision of a renewed Catholic-Nazi synthesis had become increasingly marginal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11251">'''Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities''' include a range of practices used in the treatment of [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD]], [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[Down syndrome]] and other [[developmental disability|developmental]] and [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]]. Treatments include changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[dietary supplement]]s, [[biofeedback]], [[chelation therapy]], [[homeopathy]], [[massage]] and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]]. These therapies generally rely on theories that have little scientific basis, lacking well-controlled, large, randomized trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy; small trials that have reported beneficial effects can be generally explained by the ordinary [[regression to the mean|waxing and waning of the underlying conditions]].&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

==Treatment needs==
There are a number of non-standard treatments for developmental and learning disabilities. There is a call for alternative therapies particularly when a condition lacks a reliable remediation. For example, there is no cure for autism; the main goals of mainstream behavioral and medical management are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title= Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |vauthors = Myers SM, Johnson CP, ((Council on Children with Disabilities)) |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some alternative therapies, such as [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]]s, may be appealing to some parents because the treatment recommended by most experts is thought to be "cold and manipulative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Vyse| first=Stuart| chapter=Where Do Fads Come From?| editor-last= Jacobson, Foxx &amp; Mulick| title=Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities. Fad, Fashion, and Science in Professional Practice| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn=0-8058-4192-X| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents may also consider a drug treatment for [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention deficit]] as avoidable. Alternative treatments to a [[Methylphenidate|stimulant medication]] range from natural products to [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques and highly technological interventions. It has been argued that although texts that promote alternative therapies do not directly accuse parents of inadequacy, the claims that the disability is caused by certain factors, such as poor nutrition, supports the culture of mother-blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Malacrida| title = Alternative Therapies and Attention Deficit Disorder: Discourses of Maternal Responsibility and Risk| journal = Gender &amp; Society| volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 366–385| year = 2002| url =http://gas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/3/366| doi = 10.1177/0891243202016003006| first1 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
From 12% to 64% of families of a child with ADHD use an alternative therapy, with the lower estimates likely come from narrower definitions of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM).&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Pediatric Clinics of North America |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=983–1006 |title= Complementary and alternative medical therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism |vauthors=Weber W, Newmark S |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.09.006 |pmid=18061787}}&lt;/ref&gt; School teachers, family and friends are the most common source of suggestion of alternative therapies for ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Stubberfield| title = Utilization of alternative therapies in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder| journal = Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 450–453| year = 1999| url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=2&amp;hid=112&amp;sid=93fb7429-4ea3-4507-a752-330a00d6c0a5%40sessionmgr2| doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.355401.x| pmid = 10571757| first1 = T| last2 = Parry| first2 = T| last3 = Parry| first3 = TS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, 64 percent of families of a child with special health care needs reported that they use alternative therapies. These therapies included [[spiritual healing]], massage, [[chiropractic]], [[herbs]] and special diets, homeopathy, [[self hypnosis]] and other methods of [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]]. The need for an alternative therapy was related to the child's condition and to its evaluation as repairable or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Sanders| title = Use of Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies Among Children With Special Health Care Needs in Southern Arizona | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 111 | issue = 3| pages = 584–587| year = 2003| url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/111/3/584?ck=nck| doi = 10.1542/peds.111.3.584| pmid = 12612240| first1 = H| last2 = Davis| first2 = MF| last3 = Duncan| first3 = B| last4 = Meaney| first4 = FJ| last5 = Haynes| first5 = J| last6 = Barton| first6 = LL|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that about 40% of Hong Kong children with [[autism spectrum disorder]] were treated with CAM, with the most popular therapies being [[acupuncture]], [[sensory integration therapy]], and [[Chinese herbology]]; the 40% is a lower prevalence than in Canada and the U.S., where biological-based therapies such as special diets predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Wong VC |title= Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD): comparison of Chinese and western culture (part A) |journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=454–63 |year=2009 |pmid=18784992 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0644-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. CAM is used by an estimated 20–40% of healthy children, 30–70% of children with special health care needs, and 52–95% of children with autism, and a 2009 survey of U.S. [[primary care physician]]s found that more of them recommended than discouraged [[multivitamin]]s, [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[melatonin]], and [[probiotics]] as CAM [[treatments for autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Golnik AE, Ireland M |title= Complementary alternative medicine for children with autism: a physician survey |journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume= 39|issue= 7|pages= 996–1005|year=2009 |pmid=19280328 |doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0714-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence basis==
Complementary and alternative medicine often lacks support in [[Evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], so its safety and [[efficacy]] are often questionable.

While some experts encourage parents to be open-minded, others argue that treatments and services with no proven efficacy have ''opportunity costs'' because they displace the opportunity to participate in efficient treatments and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Newsom C. |author2=Hovanovitz C. A. | chapter=The Nature and Value of Empirically Validated Interventions| editor-last= Jacobson, Foxx &amp; Mulick| title=Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities. Fad, Fashion, and Science in Professional Practice| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn=0-8058-4192-X| year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott O. Lilienfeld, &lt;blockquote&gt;many individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either. As a result, they may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. Thus, even ineffective treatments that are by themselves innocuous can indirectly produce negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lilienfeld S. O.| title = Our Raison d'Être| journal = The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice| volume = 1| issue = 1| year = 2002| url = http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is often little or no scientific evidence for effectiveness of alternative therapies.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack of scientific evidence for CAM:

Some phenomena that can explain positive results are the [[placebo effect]], the [[Hawthorne effect]] and different types of attentional and motivational effects. People with disabilities may benefit from some alternative therapies, at least for relaxation, social interaction, personal development and self-esteem.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Precautions==
Because many alternative therapies have not been evaluated in scientific studies there may be no guarantee for their safety. In most countries, with the exception of [[osteopathy]] and chiropractic, complementary medical disciplines have not been state registered. This means there is no law to forbid anyone from setting up as a practitioner even with no qualification nor experience.

'''''Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender''''' was a report prepared by [[Henry A. Murray]] for the [[United States]] [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]]. It was one of two [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] reports prepared for the OSS on [[Nazi Germany]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]; the other was "A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend" (later published in book form under the title ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'').

Murray's report is dated October 1943. [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/n/nur/analysis.php A copy in PDF is available] from the [[Cornell Law School]] library, which received copyright permission to publish the report online from Murray's family in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/n/nur/pdf/62043_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornell copy is serialized as copy number 3 of 30. The report forms a part of the law library's Donovan Collection, which contains the papers of the OSS chief [[William J. Donovan]].

==History==
Murray prepared the report, which consists of the following:

*6 unnumbered pages of [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_PRF.pdf ''Introductory Material''] (consisting of a cover page, a foreword and a table of contents)&lt;ref&gt;The report's organization is confusing. The table of contents in the ''Introductory Material'' refers to Sections 4, 5 and 6, but these sections do not exist; instead, the material for those non-existent sections appears as Parts B, C and D of Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section 1 (pages numbered 1-53) entitled a [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_1.pdf  ''Condensed Review of the Entire Memorandum''],&lt;ref&gt;The title of Section 1 (a "Condensed Review") is confusing, as it is essentially the heart of the entire memorandum, and is not a review of some more complete document.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains
**Part A (pages 1–29), ''Brief Analysis of Hitler's Personality''
**Part B (pages 29 – 33), ''Predictions of Hitler's Behavior''
**Part C (pages 33 – 38), ''Suggestions for the Treatment of Hitler''
**Part D (pages 38 – 53), ''Suggestions for the Treatment of the German People''
*Section 2, a work by W.H.D. Vernon (numbered as pages 54 – 81) entitled [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_2.pdf Hitler the Man - Notes for a Case Study]
*Section 3 (numbered as pages 82 – 227) [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_3.pdf appearing here], which is intended for "psychologists and psychiatrists."

The sources for the report, identified in the introductory material, are all published sources, including the paper which was prepared by Vernon (Section 2) under Murray's general supervision. Unlike the report prepared by Langer (see ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]''), Murray conducted no personal interviews of Hitler associates.

There is some overlap between the two wartime reports. Murray's biographer claims that Langer copied from Murray without giving proper credit.

'''Cambridge Science Centre''', initially located on [[Jesus Lane]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]], is the city's first interactive science museum.

The start-up exhibition space was opened by the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Cambridge University]], [[Leszek Borysiewicz]], on 7 February 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Citys-first-hands-on-science-museum-ready-for-launch-25012013.htm City's first hands-on science museum ready for launch].&lt;/ref&gt; the museum was opened to the public on 8 February 2013. Its first exhibition dealt with the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and principles of [[sound]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Its target audience is families and schools, particularly children between 7 and 14 years old.

The venture was founded by Dr. Chris Lennard and Dr. Katia Smith-Litiere, backed by technology entrepreneurs, including chairman [[David Cleevely]], [[Hermann Hauser]] and Jonathan Milner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/hi-tech/14700-p5m-funding-target-as-cambridge-science-centre-sets-up-home £5M funding target as Cambridge Science Centre sets up home].&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the exhibition space was closed for relocation. While they are relocating, Cambridge Science Centre is putting on a series of pop up science events known as 'Street Science'.

The '''Camelford water pollution incident''' involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]], in July 1988. Twenty [[tonne]]s of [[aluminium sulphate]] was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of [[sulphuric acid]] which "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes."&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Boiling water: Will a new inquiry on the Camelford poisoning get any nearer to the truth?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=22 August 2001|first=Doug|last=Cross|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/ClientStories/Pages/Camelford-Water-Pollution-Case.aspx|title=Camelford Water Pollution Case|work=IrwinMitchell LLP|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Still thirsting for justice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/jun/09/guardiansocietysupplement14|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=9 June 1999|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear {{As of|2012|lc=on}}. There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/real-possibility-Camelford-mass-water-poisoning/story-15517393-detail/story.html|title='Very real possibility' that Camelford mass water poisoning contributed to Somerset woman's death &amp;#124; This is Somerset|work=thisissomerset.co.uk|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times200406"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article707311.ece|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|last1=Hawkes|first1=Nigel|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. [[Barbara Clayton|Dame Barbara Clayton]] led a [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] enquiry into the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Professor Dame Barbara Clayton Honorary Fellow|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x/abstract|journal = Nutrition Bulletin|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 1467-3010|pages = 283–283|volume = 36|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x|language = en|first = Alan|last = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the [[coroner]] stated that [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt; In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a [[cover-up]] and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=The West Briton|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, [[Michael Meacher]], the former Environment Minister, claimed that "various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start." Meacher told one newspaper: "This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford: The truth will out|work=[[The Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=26 January 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ministers accused of Camelford cover-up|first=Ben|last=Russell|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=17 August 2001|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause "delayed or persistent harm" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health.&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-22200035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"&gt;http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/lwpiapp811.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a "manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers" and offered an unreserved apology.&lt;ref name="BBC-24164253"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Camelford water poisoning: Unreserved government apology | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 September 2013 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-24164253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
On 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a [[Bristol]]-based subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Zinc]], arrived at [[Lowermoor Water Treatment Works]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] and found it unmanned.&lt;ref name="wells2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver relives day of water poisoning|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=2 November 2010|first=Jeff|last=Wells|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank.&lt;ref name=wells2010/&gt; He poured the load of 20 tonnes of [[aluminium sulphate]], used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/127270.stm|title=Public inquiry calls mark Camelford anniversary|work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 July 1998|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indyscandal"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/poisoned-the-camelford-scandal-474373.html|title=Poisoned: The Camelford scandal|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rowland|first1=A|last2=Grainger|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=RS|last4=Hicks|first4=N|last5=Hughes|first5=A|title=Water contamination in north Cornwall: a retrospective cohort study into the acute and short-term effects of the aluminium sulphate incident in July 1988|year=1990|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Health|issue=110|pages=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
For several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," and was no more harmful than lemon juice.&lt;ref name="boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Day that left a bitter taste in the mouth|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|first=Steve|last=Boggan|pages=7|date=24 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right [[alkalinity]] and was safe to use and drink."&lt;ref name="timeslaw"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exemplary damages in public nuisance (AB v South West Water Services Ltd [1993] QB 507)|work=The Times|location=London|date=8 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the ''[[Western Morning News]]''.&lt;ref name="greenwood2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water bosses too slow to go public over poisoning|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=9 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority "not to mention it to anyone else".&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver was told to "tell no one" about poisoning|work=[[Cornish Guardian]]|location=Truro|date=3 November 2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.&lt;ref name="telegraph2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Staff 'silenced' over poisoned water|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=3 November 2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water company's staff 'told to keep poisoning quiet'|work=[[Express and Echo]]|location=Exeter|date=3 November 2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Cross, a [[biologist|consultant biologist]] based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained "not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt; Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, "dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it."
60,000 [[salmon]] and [[trout]] were killed in the [[River Camel|Camel]] and [[River Allen, Cornwall|Allen]] rivers during the flushing out process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2|title=The Environment: Principles and Applications|first=Chris|last=Park|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jury"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Claimants consider 11th-hour pollution compensation offer|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=6 May 1994|first=Louise|last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.&lt;ref name="gerrard"&gt;{{Cite news|title=What's happened to the children?|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date =14 July 1996|first=Nicci|last=Gerrard|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, "although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result."&lt;ref name="meacher"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A wash out: Lessons must be learned from the notorious Camelford water contamination incident|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=26 April 2006|first=Michael|last=Meacher|pages=8|authorlink=Michael Meacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been "overruled".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt; The [[National Union of Public Employees]] said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|privatisation plans]]. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said "To single him out is unfair".&lt;ref name=dennis /&gt;

==Reports and inquiries==
In August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

===Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report===
The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in South Western Region|Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority]] on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/20/lowermoor-incident-group|journal=[[Hansard]]|date=20 July 1989|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 July 1989 (cc298-9W)|volume=157|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused "real suffering" in the community.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skytimeline" /&gt; However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.&lt;ref name="rumbelow"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford spill damaged brains, says doctor|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first=Helen|last=Rumbelow|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community."&lt;ref name="vidal"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New inquiry into water poisoning: Minister promises to look again at Camelford|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|first=John|last=Vidal|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section was later amended to read "alarming statements by ''pseudo-''scientists" rather than "...by ''some'' scientists".&lt;ref name=vidal /&gt;

===COT Lowermoor Subgroup report===
In June 2000 [[Environment minister]] [[Michael Meacher]] announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared "All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that."&lt;ref name="Guardian-refused"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry refused|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/13/geoffreygibbs?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=13 June 2000|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000 the [[Environmental Law Centre]] [http://www.elc.org.uk/pages/home.htm]&lt;!--external inline link can be deleted if &amp; when ELC article has been created--&gt; prepared a petition to the [[European Parliament]] calling for a Brussels-based inquiry.&lt;ref name= harris /&gt; On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation – although not a full public inquiry – into the incident would take place.&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford health inquiry starts: Campaigners denied public hearing into contamination but minister backs 'quick' investigation|first=David|last=Graves|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=graves /&gt; Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Now Camelford waits for justice over 'poisoning'|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|location=Birmingham|date=15 August 2001|first=Andrew|last=Woodcock|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/19298.php|title=Draft Report Published into Lowermoor Water Contamination Incident, UK|work=Medical News Today|date=26 January 2005|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005 draft report====

A draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry seeks new studies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=27 January 2005|first=Paul|last=Brown|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods called for further studies and said: "We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside."&lt;ref name=brown2 /&gt;

The following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:
*the requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference
*no independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group
*an attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result
*no objective testing of the exposed population was carried out
*too much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party
*the amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored
*experts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry
*the DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public
*the executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was "misleading and biased".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

Two members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/13/water.pollution1|title=Coroner orders police to reopen Camelford pollution case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yorkshire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police to investigate claims of water poisoning cover-up|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/police_to_investigate_claims_of_water_poisoning_cover_up_1_2484066|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 final report====
The final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:

* there is no evidence that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of the incident could have caused delayed health effects
* there was an increase in childhood infections in the area, but this increase occurred before the pollution incident
* a study of cancer incidence and mortality showed that there was no increase in cancer incidence in the area after the pollution incident
* a dermatologist investigated skin and nail problems reported by individuals affected by the incident, and reported that the problems are similar to those experienced by the general population
* there is no evidence that the contaminants can cause joint or muscle pain and/or swelling, and these complaints are common in the general population
* a Camelford resident who died of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found to have higher than normal aluminium concentrations in the brain during an autopsy. However samples from the brain of a patient with similar neuropathology but unknown aluminium exposure found similar higher than usual concentrations. Research commissioned by the coroner compared 60 postmortem brains and found no correlation between aluminium  or iron concentrations and the level of congophilic angiopathy or senile plaques&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"/&gt;

==Health effects==

===Short-term===
A diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/oct/01/1|title=Official dismissed over contamination: Cornish manager made a scapegoat, says union|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 1988|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kent /&gt; These included:
*urinary complaints,
*[[desquamation|blistering and peeling]] of skin,
*hair turning blue or green,
*diarrhoea and vomiting, and
*[[arthralgia|joint pains]].

===Long-term===
A 1999 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that some victims had suffered "considerable damage" to their brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Altmann| first = Paul |author2=John Cunningham |author3=Usha Dhanesha |author4=Margaret Ballard |author5=James Thompson |author6=Frank Marsh | title = Disturbance of cerebral function in people exposed to drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulphate: retrospective study of the Camelford water incident|journal=BMJ|volume=319| issue = 7213|pages=807–811|date=25 September 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7213/807| pmid = 10496822| pmc = 314205| doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the [[#Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report|1991 LIHAG report]] telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant [[nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], [[Oxford]], and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of [[Alzheimer's disease]], which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.&lt;ref name=rumbelow /&gt; Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brain damage found in pollution victims|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=24 September 1999|first=Chris|last=Court|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.&lt;ref name="laurance"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Contaminated water caused long-term brain damage in Camelford, say doctors study|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first1=Jeremy|last1=Laurance|first2=Cherry|last2=Norton|first3=Steve|last3=Boggan|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which "found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.&lt;ref name=boggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

===Later deaths of victims===
The husband of [[#Carol Cross|Carol Cross]], who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;

Victim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt; In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an "unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain".

====Carol Cross====
In 2006 a post-mortem [[inquest]] into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|beta amyloid angiopathy]], a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.&lt;ref name="savill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's symptoms in toxic water woman's brain|work=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 December 2005|first=Richard|last=Savill|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water link to Alzheimer's|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|location=Liverpool)|date=16 December 2005|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."&lt;ref name=liverpool /&gt; Daniel Perl, of New York's [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said: "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted."&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2006|first=Nigel|last=Hawkes|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused "to either finance or assist" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|congophilic amyloid angiopathy]]. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from [[Somerset County Council]] so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Inquests: Camelford coroner attacks lack of state cash|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Steven|last=Morris|pages=8|date=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner to quiz ex-water chief|work=Western Morning News|location=Plymouth|date=31 July 2009|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose said that "ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer" 2010. He explained "This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton."&lt;ref name=greenwood /&gt;

When the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in [[bioinorganic chemistry]] at [[Keele University]], said "The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease." [[Neuropathology|Neuropathologist]] Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], said "I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide."&lt;ref name="greenwood4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Experts: Highly likely that polluted water caused death|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.&lt;ref name="greenwood5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison in water 'led to death'|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a [[narrative verdict]] recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were "beyond belief".&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-17367243 |title=BBC News – Camelford water poisoning: Authority 'gambled with lives'|work=bbc.co.uk |date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident," and that "[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=[[The West Briton]]|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|location=Truro|accessdate=24 September 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions against South West Water Authority==
In 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at [[Exeter]] Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in [[Truro]]. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000.&lt;ref name=jury /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1908534.stm|title=Camelford poisoning hearings begin|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water claims settled|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4650262.html|date=11 May 1994|accessdate=24 September 2011}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later claimed they were "railroaded" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their [[Legal aid#Legal aid in England and Wales|legal aid]] funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt; The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: "If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed" and that they were "extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Residents accept pounds 400,000 from water company for pollution|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 May 1994|first=Paul|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross later said: "The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;

==Allegations of a cover-up==
On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of "a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation," and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up."&lt;ref name="bruxelles"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner fears toxic water was covered up|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 December 2007|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the incident the [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water industry was about to be privatised]] by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to [[Michael Howard]], then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as "very distracting" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also "be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Lethal Cover-up|work=Daily Mail|location=London|date=15 December 2007|page=36|first=Sue|last=Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Western Morning News]]'', using a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], warning: "Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation."&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;
There was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.

The former North Cornwall [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament (MP) [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Paul Tyler]] also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6{{nbsp}}am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this "was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th," and added that the prosecution would say that the authority "misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public."&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;Western Morning News, Was there a Camelford cover-up?, 14 December 2007. [http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 Available over the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130505152742/http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 |date=5 May 2013 }} by subscription&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler said "I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why."&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt;

In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that "There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." No named individuals were ever prosecuted.
The national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;

The '''Centre for the Study of Developing Societies''' ('''CSDS''') is an [[India]]n research institute for the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. It was founded in 1963 by [[Rajni Kothari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/1999/481/481%20kothari.htm |title=Personally speaking: Rajni Kothari|publisher=India-seminar.com |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is largely funded by the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] Govt of India.&lt;ref name="csds.in"&gt;[http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=aboutCSDS About CSDS], CSDS website, 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[New Delhi]], close to [[Delhi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=location |title=Getting to CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Overview==
Kothari left his position as assistant director of the National Institute of Community Development in 1963 to start the CSDS. It was housed initially in a building owned by the Indian Adult Education Association at Indraprastha Estate, Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview Rajni Kothari, The Centre and Indian reality |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2012/639/639_interview_kothari.htm# |publisher=Seminar |date=2012 |accessdate=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSDS later moved in 1966-1967 to its present location.

==Library==
The library at CSDS started with a few bookshelves in the basement of IAEA and grew up into a full-fledged one by 1970. It is meant primarily for research and higher learning in the field of social sciences and humanities. The collection consists of about 29,000 books and 5,000 bound volumes of journals and a modest set of reports and booklets. More than 130 journals are received regularly. Apart from works on contemporary themes, the library houses a collection of works on Asia and Africa, arms race and peace movement, non-European perspectives, science studies, ecology and environment, and human rights. There is a separate collection of Hindi books covering a broad range of subjects including literature. The access to the collection has been computerized and the catalogue can be accessed through any computer in the centre. The CSDS library is a member of the [[Developing Libraries Network]] and the [[Social Science Libraries Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/index.php?inc=library |title=CSDS - Centre for the Study of Developing Societies |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data unit==
The CSDS Data Unit, established in 1965, maintains an archive of survey data on political behaviour and attitudes, spanning over four decades. The unit also holds a number of secondary data sets, especially on elections in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csds.in/data_unit.htm |title=CSDS |publisher=Csds.in |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate justice''' is a term used for framing [[global warming]] as an [[ethical]] and [[political]] issue, rather than one that is purely environmental or physical in nature. This is done by relating  the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to concepts of [[justice]], particularly [[environmental justice]] and [[social justice]] and by examining issues such as [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[human rights]], [[Individual and group rights|collective rights]], and the historical responsibilities for [[climate change]]. A fundamental proposition of climate justice is that those who are least responsible for climate change suffer its gravest consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Global Humanitarian Forum (1 October 2009) [http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=13791 Kofi Annan launches climate justice campaign track], Global Humanitarian Formum, 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/climate-change-impact-injustice/1#.Vb53mXjSZek Wendy Koch, Study: Climate change affects those least responsible], ''[[USA Today]]'', March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/node/270716 Africa Speaks up on Climate Change] This appeal states: "In wealthy countries, the looming climate crisis is a matter of concern, as it will affect the wellbeing of the economy. But in Africa, which is hardly contributing to climate change in the first place, it will be a matter of life and death."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term climate justice is also used to mean actual legal action on climate change issues.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example the Climate Justice Programme's [http://www.climatelaw.org/ Climate Law Database].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a report of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] identified 894 ongoing legal actions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Patricia Jolly, [https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2018/10/09/les-pays-bas-sommes-par-la-justice-d-intensifier-leur-lutte-contre-le-changement-climatique_5366987_1652612.html "Les Pays-Bas sommés par la justice d’intensifier leur lutte contre le changement climatique"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 9 October 2018 (page visited on 18 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for the differential effects of climate change ==
[[File:Mobilization for Climate Justice- Stop Chevron.jpg|thumb|Rally for climate justice (2009).]]
The ability of populations to mitigate and adapt to the negative consequences of climate change are shaped by factors such as income, race, class, gender, capital and political representation.&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; As low-income communities and communities of color possess few if any adaptive resources, they are particularly vulnerable to climate change.&lt;ref name="ref 100"&gt;{{cite book |last=Christian-Smith |first=Juliet |title=A twenty-first century US water policy |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199859443 |author2=Peter H.

== History of the term's use ==

In 2000, at the same time as the [[UNFCCC#2000 – COP 6, The Hague, Netherlands|Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP 6)]], the first Climate Justice Summit took place in [[The Hague]]. This summit aimed to "affirm that climate change is a rights issue" and to "build alliances across states and borders" against climate change and in favor of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=333 CorpWatch: Alternative Summit Opens with Call for Climate Justice], November 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in August–September 2002, international environmental groups met in [[Johannesburg]] for the [[Earth Summit 2002|Earth Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020930131246/http://www.worldsummit2002.org/ website worldsummit2002.org] (archive)&lt;/ref&gt; At this summit, also known as Rio+10, as it took place ten years after the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], the Bali Principles of Climate Justice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejnet.org/ej/bali.pdf Bali Principles of Climate Justice], PDF, August 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted.

In 2004, the Durban Group for Climate Justice was formed at an international meeting in [[Durban]], South Africa. Here representatives from [[NGO]]s and peoples' movements discussed realistic policies for addressing climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tni.org/en/profile/durban-group-for-climate-justice Durban group for Climate Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Bali Conference]], the global coalition [[Climate Justice Now!]] was founded, and, in 2008, the [[Global Humanitarian Forum]] focused on climate justice at its inaugural meeting in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/statements/ghfg240608.shtml The Global Humanitarian Forum Annual Meeting 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Climate Justice Action]] Network was formed during the run-up to the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/en/content/climate-change-and-justice-road-copenhagen Climate Change and Justice: On the road to Copenhagen], Heinrich Böll Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed [[civil disobedience]] and [[direct action]] during the summit, and many climate activists used the slogan 'system change not climate change'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/pt/2009/12/932387.shtml 100,000 march for System Change not climate change in Copenhagen with mass arrests] ''[[Indymedia]]'', December 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the [[World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] took place in [[Tiquipaya]], Bolivia. It was hosted by the government of Bolivia as a global gathering of civil society and governments. The conference published a "People's Agreement" calling, among other things, for greater climate justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwccc.wordpress.com/support/ World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, People's Agreement] April 22, Cochabamba, Bolivia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial interpretations ==

One contentious issue in debates about climate justice is the extent to which [[capitalism]] is viewed as its root cause. This question frequently leads to fundamental disagreements between, on the one hand, liberal and conservative environmental groups and, on the other, leftist and radical organizations. While the former often tend to blame the exesses of [[neoliberalism]] for climate change and argue in favor of market-based reform, the latter view capitalism with its exploitative traits as the underlying central issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spaceformovement.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/space_for_movement2.pdf Space for Movement: Reflections from Bolivia on climate justice, social movements and the state] PDF, edited by Building Bridges collective, July 2010, {{ISBN|978 0 85316 294 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/node/272493 Is a Successful Ecological Turnaround of Capitalism Possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina case study===
[[File:Hurricane Katrina flooding.jpg|thumb|NASA flood image after [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]

According to one study, [[Hurricane Katrina]] provided insights into how climate change disasters affect different people differently,&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; as it had a disproportionate effect on low-income and minority groups.&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; A study on the race and class dimensions of Hurricane Katrina suggests that those most vulnerable include poor, black, brown, elderly, sick, and homeless people.&lt;ref name="ref 400"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|title=Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability|journal=College Literature|volume=33|issue=3|pages=171–196|doi=10.1353/lit.2006.0037|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income and black communities had little resources and limited mobility to evacuate before the storm.&lt;ref name="ref 500"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=James R.|author2=Pais, Jeremy|title=Race, class, and Hurricane Katrina: Social differences in human responses to disaster|journal=Social Science Research|volume=35|issue=2|pages=295–321|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.02.003|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 600"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.06.013 | title=Distribution of impacts of natural disasters across income groups: A case study of New Orleans | journal=Ecological Economics | date=2007 | volume=63 | issue=2-3 | pages=299–306 | first=Michel | last=Masozera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, after the hurricane, low-income communities were most affected by contamination,&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; and this was made worse by the fact that government relief measures failed to adequately assist those most at risk.&lt;ref name="ref 300"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 400"/&gt;

== Legal actions on climate change issues ==

In 2018, ten families from European countries, Kenya and Fiji filed a suit against the [[European Union]] for the threats against their homes caused by the EU greenhouse emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Families from 8 countries sue EU over climate change|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20180524-families-8-countries-sue-eu-over-climate-change|accessdate=28 May 2018|work=France 24|agency=AFP|date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against states ===

==== Netherlands ====

In 2012, the Dutch lawyer Roger Cox gave the idea of judicial intervention to force action against [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Urgenda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cox, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/14/judiciary-climate-change?guni=Article:in%20body%20link "It is time for the judiciary to step in and avert climate catastrophe"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 November 2012 (page visited on 6 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Urgenda Foundation, with 900 co-plaintiffs, has filed a lawsuit against the [[Government of the Netherlands]] "for not taking sufficient measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause dangerous climate change".&lt;ref name=Urgenda/&gt;

In 2015, the District Court of The Hague ruled that the government of the [[Netherlands]] must do more to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to protect its citizens from climate change (Urgenda climate case).&lt;ref name=Urgenda&gt;[http://www.urgenda.nl/en/climate-case/ Urgenda climate case], Urgenda Foundation (page visited on 6 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schiermeier&gt;Quirin Schiermeier, [http://www.nature.com/news/landmark-court-ruling-tells-dutch-government-to-do-more-on-climate-change-1.17841 "Landmark court ruling tells Dutch government to do more on climate change"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neslen&gt;Arthur Neslen, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling "Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as a "precedent-setting judgment"&lt;ref name=Schiermeier/&gt; and as the "world’s first climate liability suit".&lt;ref name=Neslen/&gt;

According to James Thornton, chief executive of [[Client Earth]], "Most remarkably, it is based in essence on established science and the ancient principle of a government's duty of care. That reasoning is applicable in any legal system and will certainly be used by courts in other countries".&lt;ref name=Schiermeier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is also supported by the [http://globaljustice.macmillan.yale.edu/news/oslo-principles-global-climate-change-obligations Oslo Principles on Global Climate Change Obligations].

[[File:Honor bilt modern homes. (1921) (14761021821).jpg|thumb|320px|right|'''Cottage windows''' are visible in this view of a [[bungalow]]-style house dating to 1921.]]

A '''cottage window''' is a [[double-hung window]] — i.e., a window with two sashes sliding up and down, hung with one atop the other in the same frame — in which the  upper sash is smaller (shorter) than the lower one. The upper sash often contains smaller lights divided by [[Muntin|muntins]] (often known as a "divided light pattern" or "grille"), although in some cases both sashes may be divided. 

Cottage windows are especially characteristic of [[bungalow]] or [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]]-style houses. Also called a "front window".

'''DCMU''' ('''3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea''') is an [[algicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/diuron.html | title = Diuron Data Sheet }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[herbicide]] of the aryl[[ureas|urea]] class that inhibits [[photosynthesis]]. It was introduced by [[Bayer]] in 1954 under the trade name of '''Diuron'''.

==Mechanism of action==
DCMU is a very specific and sensitive inhibitor of photosynthesis. It blocks the [[plastoquinone]] binding site of [[photosystem II]], disallowing the electron flow from where it is generated, in photosystem II, to plastoquinone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-5793(86)80911-5 | title = Evidence for a dual function of the herbicide-binding D1 protein in photosystem II | year = 1986 | last1 = Metz | first1 = J | last2 = Pakrasi | first2 = H | last3 = Seibert | first3 = M | last4 = Arntzer | first4 = C | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 205 | issue = 2 | pages = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interrupts the photosynthetic [[electron transport chain]] in photosynthesis and thus reduces the ability of the plant to turn light energy into chemical energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[reductant|reductant potential]]).

DCMU only blocks electron flow from photosystem II, it has no effect on photosystem I or other reactions in photosynthesis, such as light absorption or carbon fixation in the [[Calvin cycle]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2014}}

However, because it absorbs electrons [[oxidized]] from water in [[PS II]], the electron "hole" of [[PS I]] cannot be satisfied, effectively shutting down "linear" photosynthesis by blocking the reduction of [[NADP|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to NADPH.
At the same time, it was found that DCMU not only does not inhibit the [[Photophosphorylation#Cyclic photophosphorylation|cyclic photosynthetic pathway]], but, under certain circumstances, actually stimulates it.&lt;ref&gt;HUBER, S.C. EDWARDS, G.E. (1976), Studies on the Pathway of Cyclic Electron Flow in Mesophyll Chloroplasts of a C4 Plant, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics, Volume 449, Issue 3, 6 December 1976, Pages 420-433, {{doi|10.1016/0005-2728(76)90153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc =  1056483 | pmid=16665372 | volume=83 | issue=4 | title=Regulation of Cyclic Photophosphorylation during Ferredoxin-Mediated Electron Transport : Effect of DCMU and the NADPH/NADP Ratio |date=April 1987 | journal=Plant Physiol. | pages=965–9 | doi=10.1104/pp.83.4.965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these effects, DCMU is often used to study energy flow in [[photosynthesis]].

A '''definition of music''' endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of [[definition|defining]] what is meant by the term ''[[music]]''. Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as ''organized sound'' but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as [[human speech]], and sounds found in both [[Natural environment|natural]] and [[Industrial society|industrial]] environments {{harv|Kania|2014}}. The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of [[culture in music cognition]]. 

The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' defines music as "the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion" {{harv|Concise Oxford Dictionary|1992}}. However, the music genres known as [[noise music]] and [[musique concrète]], for instance, challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical, like randomly produced electronic [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]], and compositional processes using [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] ({{harvnb|Priest|2013|loc=132}}; {{harvnb|Hagerty|2007}}).

An oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled ''[[4'33'']]'' (1952) by the American composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered "musical" and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard {{harv|Dodd|2013}}. Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form {{harv|Gann|2010}}.


==Concepts of music==

Because of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as "music," as that word is generally understood by Western cultures {{harv|Nettl|2005}}. [[Inuit]] and most [[North American Indian]] languages do not have a general term for music. Among the [[Aztecs]], the ancient [[Mexico|Mexican]] theory of rhetorics, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the [[Nahuatl]] term ''In xochitl-in kwikatl'' to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserve the word ''Kwikakayotl'' (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions {{harv|Leon-Portilla|2007|loc=11}}. In [[Africa]] there is no term for music in [[Tiv language|Tiv]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Berom language|Birom]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Idoma language|Idoma]], [[Eggon language|Eggon]] or [[Jarawa language (Nigeria)|Jarawa]]. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term ''music'' ({{harvnb|Schafer|1996|loc=222-223}}). The [[Mapuche]] of [[Argentina]] do not have a word for ''music'', but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (''kantun''), European and non-Mapuche music (''kantun winka''), ceremonial songs (''öl''), and ''tayil'' {{harv|Robertson–de Carbo|1976|loc=39}}.

While some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music ({{harvnb|Nettl|1989|loc=48}}). ''Musiqi'' is the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the science and art of music, ''muzik'' being the sound and performance of music ({{harvnb|Sakata|1983|loc=39}}), though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as [[Quran]] chanting, are excluded.

==Music vs. noise==
[[Ben Watson (music writer)|Ben Watson]] points out that [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Große Fuge|Grosse Fuge]]'' (1825) "sounded like noise" to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling ''Allegro''. They subsequently published it separately {{harv|Watson|n.d.|loc=109–10}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--Is this meant to differentiate "music" from "noise", or to assert that the two things may not be indistinguishable?--&gt; Musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus&amp;nbsp;... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=48, 55}}.

==Definitions==

===Organized sound===
{{See also|Musique concrete|Acousmatic music|Spectral music}} 
An often-cited definition of music is that it is "organized sound", a term originally coined by [[modernist]] composer [[Edgard Varèse]] {{harv|Goldman|1961|loc=133}} in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Varèse's concept of music as "organized sound" fits into his vision of "sound as living matter" and of "musical space as open rather than bounded" {{harv|Chou|1966a|loc=1&amp;ndash;4}}. He conceived the elements of his music in terms of "sound-masses", likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of [[crystallization]] {{harv|Chou|1966b|loc=157}}. Varèse thought that "to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]", and he posed the question, "what is music but organized noises?" {{harv|Varèse and Chou|1966|loc=18}}.

The fifteenth edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that "while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit." A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as "musical", but perhaps less often as "music"). The composer [[R. Murray Schafer|R. Murray]] {{harvtxt|Schafer|1996|loc=284}} states that the sound of classical music "has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any 'cultural' musicality." However, in the view of semiologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]], "just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;48}}. (See "[[Definition of music#Social construct|music as social construct]]" below.)'''''

====Language====
{{Main|Musical language}}
Levi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method such as mathematics {{harv|Ashby|2004|loc=4}}.

===Musical universals===
{{main|Elements of music}}
Most definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]], [[duration (music)|duration]], spatial location and [[Texture (music)|texture]] ({{harvnb| Burton |2015|loc=22–28}}). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following [[Wittgenstein]], cognitive psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]] proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category {{harv|Rosch|1973|loc=328}}. As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition {{harv|Levitin|2006|loc=136–39}}. This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English language writers refer to as music.

===Social construct===
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Many people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity" (''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', online edition).

===Subjective experience===
{{main|Aesthetics of music}}

This approach to the definition focuses not on the ''construction'' but on the ''experience'' of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the  Italian composer [[Luciano Berio]]: “Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music” {{harv|Berio, Dalmonte, and Varga|1985|loc=19}}. This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's ''essence'' ''as music'' {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}.

==Specific definitions==

===Clifton===
In his 1983 book, ''Music as Heard'', which sets out from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] position of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricœur]], Thomas Clifton defines music as "an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is [[Presentationism|presentative]] rather than [[Denotation|denotative]]. . . . This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects." More precisely, "music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=1}}. It is therefore "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=10}}.

Clifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: "a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced." However, "It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening ''to'' the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition 'to' puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=2}}.

In this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. "It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word ''ordered'' in this definition of music" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=3–4}}. This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme [[relativism]], since "it is precisely the 'subjective' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in 'objective,' scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like [[seeing pink elephants]], and that reporting about such an experience need not be [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=8–9}}.

Clifton's task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called "phenomena," and the activity of describing phenomena is called "phenomenology" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}. It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. &lt;blockquote&gt;Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. . . . To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. . . . Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. . . . Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful. {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=5–6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nattiez===
"Music, often an [[art]]/[[entertainment]], is a [[total social fact]] whose definitions vary according to [[era]] and [[culture]]," according to [[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=37}}. It is often contrasted with [[noise (environmental)|noise]]. According to musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]]: "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;8 and 55}}. Given the above demonstration that "there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical," {{harv|Molino|1975|loc=42}} an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.

Nattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite]] semiological scheme similar to the following:
{|
|-
|colspan=3|Poietic Process
|colspan=2|Esthesic Process
|-
|Composer (Producer)
| →
|Sound (Trace)
| ←
|Listener (Receiver)
|}

There are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:
*"&lt;!-- If musical semiology's sole contribution were replacing what everybody calls "composition" and "perception" with barbarou neologisms like 'poietic' and 'esthesic', then semiology would entail risibly small profits. There is, of course, more to it than that. --&gt; By 'poietic' I understand describing the ''link'' among the composer's intentions, his creative procedures, his mental schemas, and the ''result'' of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work's material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it 'the interior ear'): what the composer hears while imagining the work's sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape."
*"By 'esthesic' I understand not merely the artificially attentive hearing of a musicologist, but the description of perceptive behaviors within a given population of listeners; that is how this or that aspect of sonorous reality is captured by their perceptive strategies" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=90}}.
*The neutral level is that of the physical "trace", (Saussere's sound-image, a sonority, a score), created and interpreted by the esthesic level (which corresponds to a perceptive definition; the perceptive and/or "social" construction definitions below) and the poietic level (which corresponds to a creative, as in compositional, definition; the organizational and social construction definitions below).

Table describing types of definitions of music {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=46}}:
{| class="wikitable"
!
!poietic level&lt;br/&gt;(choice of the composer)
!neutral level&lt;br/&gt;(physical definition)
!esthesic level&lt;br/&gt;(perceptive judgment)
|-
! music
| musical sound
| sound of the&lt;br/&gt;harmonic&lt;br/&gt;spectrum
| agreeable sound
|-
! non-music
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(nonmusical)
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(complex sound)
| disagreeable&lt;br/&gt;noise
|}

Because of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and [[oscillation|vibration]] or [[acoustics]], the cognitive study of music, the study of [[music theory]] and performance practice or music theory and [[ethnomusicology]] and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called [[musicology]].

===Xenakis===
Composer [[Iannis Xenakis]] in "Towards a Metamusic" (chapter 7 of ''Formalized Music'') defined music in the following way {{harv|Xenakis|1971|loc=181}}:
#It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.
#It is an individual [[pleroma]], a realization.
#It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, . . ., arguments)
#It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.
#It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.
#It is the gratuitous play of a child.
#It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.

'''Doenjang girl''' or '''Doenjang woman''' ([[hangul]]:된장녀) is a [[Satire|satirical]] [[expression (language)|expression]] used in [[South Korea]] "for their propensity to scrimp on essentials so they can over-spend on [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuous luxuries]]".&lt;ref name=maxfisher/&gt; These girls and young women are addicted to luxury and [[vanity]].&lt;ref name="hangukki"&gt;[http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/newstopic/200702/sp2007021317041058770.htm 실사로 보는… '이것이 된장녀의 하루!'] The Hanguk 2007/02/13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hangul]] spelling is Doenjang Nyeo (된장녀).&lt;ref name="hangukki"/&gt;

The '''Essex School''' constitutes a variety of [[discourse analysis]], one that combines theoretical sophistication – mainly due to its reliance on the [[post-structuralist]] and psychoanalytic traditions and, in particular, on the work of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], etc. – with analytical precision,{{Verify source|date=December 2013}} since it focuses predominantly on an in-depth analysis of political discourses in [[late modernity]]. 

Founding figures of this approach are [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]], two [[post-Marxist]] political theorists, who, disillusioned with economic reductionism, tried, since the 1970s, to reinterpret [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]’s theory of [[hegemony]] to highlight the role of meaning and of processes of interpellation and identification in the creation of political identities and in the articulation and sedimentation of political discourses and hegemonic orders. The paradigmatic formulation of this innovative orientation and of its various conceptual innovations can be found in Laclau’s and Mouffe’s ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', first published in 1985, as well as in many subsequent contributions of the two thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;See Laclau, Ernesto &amp; Mouffe, Chantal, ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'', London: Verso, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The approach developed by Laclau and Mouffe and the theoretical traditions influencing their thought – mainly Saussurean linguistics, Lacanian psychoanalysis and deconstruction – provided the teaching backbone of the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis Laclau founded at the [[University of Essex]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme website: http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/&lt;/ref&gt; Already from its inception, the programme attracted many MA and PhD students from around the globe, especially from Argentina, Mexico, Greece, Denmark, Spain, the US and the UK. Many PhD theses further developing Laclau’s and Mouffe’s discourse theory and/or applying it in the empirical analysis of concrete empirical cases have since been completed. Graduates of the programme are now employed by universities in many parts of the world, while the programme itself is run by three members of staff at Essex: [[Aletta Norval]], David Howarth and Jason Glynos, all ex-PhD students of Laclau. Academics associated with the programme have also set up a World Network in Ideology and Discourse Analysis,&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/idaworld/&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a web-based channel of communication between its 203 registered members and has also organized the Inaugural World Conference in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, which took place from 8-10 September 2008 at Roskilde University, Denmark, with Ernesto Laclau as keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://magenta.ruc.dk/isg/discourse/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apart from setting up a distinct graduate programme, now in its third decade, three other factors are indicative of the increasing international recognition and the gradual institutionalization of the research tradition initiated by Laclau and Mouffe: (i) The activities of the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, also founded by Laclau at the University of Essex (and now co-directed by Norval and Howarth), which functioned as the intellectual hub of the Ideology and Discourse Analysis group;&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/Theostud/&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) The publication, from 2000 onwards, of a series of monographs, edited collections and textbooks by members of the group, some of them based on the doctoral research conducted within the programme;&lt;ref&gt;Especially see: Howarth, David, ''Discourse'', Buckingham: Open University Press, 2000; Howarth, David, Norval, Aletta &amp; Stavrakakis, Yannis (eds) ''Discourse Theory and Political Analysis: identities, hegemonies and social change''. Manchester - New York: Manchester University Press – St Martin's Press, 2000; and Howarth, David &amp; Torfing, Jacob (eds) ''Discourse Theory in European Politics'', Houndmills: Palgrave, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) The inclusion of the orientation developed by Laclau and Mouffe and their students as a distinct research direction within the field of discourse analysis in textbooks and introductions to the field published by independent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Phillips, Louise &amp; Jorgensen, Marianne, ''Discourse Analysis as Theory and Method''. London: Sage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of all these developments, the distinct identity of the group and of its research output gradually triggered a process of naming. From 2003 onwards, when critics wanted to refer to the work of members of the group, they used the phrase ‘the Essex School’,&lt;ref&gt;See Townshend, Jules, ‘Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, ''Political Studies'', 52, 2004, pp. 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely used by both members of the group and ‘outsiders’.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Robinson, Andrew, ‘The Politics of Lack’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 6, 2004, pp. 259-269; Selg, Peeter &amp; Ventsel, Andreas, ‘An Outline of a Semiotic Theory of Hegemony’, ''Semiotica'', 182, 2010, pp. 443-474; Soage, Ana, ‘La teoria del discurso de la escuela de Essex an su contexto teorico’, clac circulo, no. 25, 2006: http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/soage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Essex School does not limit the research direction of its ‘members’, each one of whom develops her or his own orientation independently; it offers, however, a loose framework within which a multitude of theoretical and political interventions can flourish, enriching the original vision of Laclau and Mouffe.

'''''Fiqh''''' ({{IPAc-en|f|iː|k}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fiqh "fiqh"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|{{large|فقه}}}} {{IPA-ar|fɪqh|}}) is [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="Fiqh"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Fiqh'' is often described as the human understanding of the ''[[sharia]],''&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]). Fiqh  expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[ulama]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and is implemented by the rulings (''[[fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas ''sharia'' is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, ''fiqh'' is considered fallible and changeable. ''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice, plus two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice. A person trained in ''fiqh'' is known as a ''[[faqīh]]'' (plural ''fuqaha'').&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Figuratively, ''fiqh'' means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources and deriving religious rulings from their sources necessitates the ''[[mujtahid]]'' (an individual who exercises ''ijtihad'') to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence. A ''faqīh'' must look deep down into a matter and not suffice himself with just the apparent meaning, and a person who only knows the appearance of a matter is not qualified as a ''faqīh''.&lt;ref name="Fiqh"/&gt;

The studies of ''fiqh'', are traditionally divided into ''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' ([[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]], lit. the roots of fiqh), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and ''Furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} ''Furūʿ al-fiqh'' is the product of the application of ''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will. A ''[[hukm]]'' (plural ''aḥkām'') is a particular ruling in a given case.

== Etymology ==
The word ''fiqh'' is an Arabic term meaning "deep understanding"&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}} or "full comprehension". Technically it refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources (which are studied in the [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]) and the process of gaining knowledge of Islam through jurisprudence. The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves connected to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], ''fiqh'' has come to mean jurisprudence in general, be it Islamic or secular. It is thus possible to speak of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] as an expert in the [[common law]] ''fiqh'' of the [[United States]], or of [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] as an expert in the civil law ''fiqh'' of Egypt.

==History==
{{main article|Sharia}}
{{further information|Islamic economics in the world}}

The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "customarily divided into eight periods":&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1&gt;[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;
*the first period ending with the death of [[Muhammad]] in 11 AH.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*second period "characterized by personal interpretations" of the canon by the ''[[Sahabah]]'' or companions of Muhammad, lasting until 50 AH.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*from 50 AH until the early second century AH there was competition between a "a traditionalist approach to jurisprudence" in [[Hijaz|western Arabia]] where Islam was revealed and a "rationalist approach in Iraq".&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*the "golden age of classical Islamic jurisprudence" from the "early second to the mid-fourth century when the [[Madhhab#Amman Message|eight "most significant"]] schools of Sunni and [[Shia|Shi'i]] jurisprudence emerged."&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*from the mid-fourth century to mid-seventh AH Islamic jurisprudence was "limited to elaborations within the main juristic schools".&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*the "dark age" of Islamic jurisprudence stretched from the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] in the mid-seventh AH (1258 CE) to 1293 AH/1876 CE.
*In 1293 AH (1876 CE) the Ottomans codified [[Hanafi]] jurisprudence in the ''[[Mecelle|Majallah el-Ahkam-i-Adliya]]''. Several "juristic revival movements" influenced by "exposure to Western legal and technological progress"  followed until the mid-20th century CE. [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] were products of this era.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
*The most recent era has been that of the "[[Islamic revival#Contemporary revivalism|Islamic revival]]", which has been "predicated on rejection of Western social and legal advances" and the development of specifically Islamic states, social sciences, economics, and finance.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;
The formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with issues of authority and teaching than with theory and methodology.&lt;ref name="Weiss (2002)"&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (2002). ''Studies in Islamic Legal Theory'', edited by [[Bernard G. Weiss]], (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2002. pp. 3, 161.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress in theory and methodology happened with the coming of the early Muslim jurist [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i]] (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book ''ar-Risālah''. The book details the four roots of law ([[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], ''[[ijma]]'', and ''[[qiyas]]'') while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=weiss-162&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (2002). ''Studies in Islamic Legal Theory'', edited by Bernard G. Weiss, (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2002. p. 162.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary sources of law were developed and refined over the subsequent centuries, consisting primarily of juristic preference (''[[istihsan]]''), laws of the previous prophets (''[[shara man qablana]]''), continuity (''[[istishab]]''), extended analogy (''[[maslaha mursala]]''), blocking the means (''[[sadd al-dhari'ah]]''), custome ''[[urf]]'' and saying of a companion (''[[qawl al-sahabi]]'').&lt;ref name="Nyazee (2000)"&gt;Nyazee, Imran Ahsan Khan (2000).

=== Diagram of early scholars ===

The Quran set the rights, the responsibilities and the rules for people and for societies to adhere to, like not dealing in interest. Muhammad then provided an example, which is recorded in the hadith books, showing people how he practically implemented these rules in a society. After the passing of [[Muhammad]], there was a need for jurists, to decide on new legal matters where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadith, example of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] regarding a similar case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMxjJqurmiAC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=development+of+schools+of+thought+hanifa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vvMMUe7WLs62hAevmIBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=development%20of%20schools%20of%20thought%20hanifa&amp;f=false|title=Islam Vs.

In the years proceeding Muhammad, the community in Madina continued to use the same rules. People were familiar with the practice of Muhammad and therefore continued to use the same rules.

The scholars appearing in the diagram below were taught by [[Muhammad's companions]], many of whom settled in Madina.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewley.virtualave.net/ulama.html|title=ulama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]&lt;ref name="bewley.virtualave.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewley.virtualave.net/muwcont.html|title=Muwatta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Malik ibn Anas]] was written as a consensus of the opinion, of these scholars.&lt;ref name="Coulson"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Ks31qHlSYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coulson+history+islamic+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QVA59sVI8G&amp;sig=stT7OrQHTIkIJ6mgK5-kQzT0gAg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=durLTOa5KI_QjAe06rnYBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A History of Islamic Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=Muwatta+consensus+of+the+opinions+scholars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqQLUaSqMKy20QXX1YHwDA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Muwatta%20consensus%20of%20the%20opinions%20scholars&amp;f=false|title=E.

Much of the knowledge we have about Muhammad is narrated through [[Aisha]] the wife of Muhammad, also a renowned scholar of her time. Aisha raised and taught her nephew [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] after her brother [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] was killed by the Syrians.

Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter [[Farwah bint al-Qasim]] was married to [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and was the mother of [[Jafar al-Sadiq]]. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and the grandfather of Jafar al-Sadiq whose views the twelver Shias follow. The twelver Shia do not accept Abu Bakr as the first caliph but do accept his great-great-grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.

Aisha also taught her nephew [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]]. He then taught his son [[Hisham ibn Urwah]], who was the main teacher of [[Malik ibn Anas]] whose views many Sunni follow and also taught Jafar al-Sadiq. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Hisham ibn Urwah and Muhammad al-Baqir taught [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Jafar al-Sadiq, [[Abu Hanifa]], and Malik ibn Anas.

Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina. Along with Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Muhammad al-Baqir, Zayd ibn Ali and over 70 other leading jurists and scholars.

[[Al-Shafi‘i]] was taught by Malik ibn Anas. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] was taught by Al-Shafi‘i. [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] travelled everywhere collecting hadith and his father [[Ismail ibn Ibrahim]] was a student of Malik ibn Anas.&lt;ref name="Islam Page 67"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlGgGVCp0UcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim+ibn+muhammad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwQpUfqMBYi80QXqs4GoAw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=aisha%20and%20qasim%20ibn%20muhammad&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Women in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdjtUTYSL1UC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim+ibn+muhammad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwQpUfqMBYi80QXqs4GoAw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aisha%20and%20qasim%20ibn%20muhammad&amp;f=false|title=Classical Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlqeC1ZFAUEC&amp;pg=PT101&amp;dq=aisha+and+qasim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gwMpUebmBuTC0QXL2ID4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Judaism and Islam in Practice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/mutmainaa7/people/jafar_al_sadiq.html|title=Jafar Al-Sadiq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziaraat.org/jafar.php|title=IMAM JAFAR BIN MUHAMMAD AS-SADIQ (AS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam scholars diagram}}

In the books actually written by these original jurists and scholars, there are very few theological and judicial differences between them. Imam Ahmad rejected the writing down and codifying of the religious rulings he gave. They knew that they might have fallen into error in some of their judgements and stated this clearly. They never introduced their rulings by saying, "Here, this judgement is the judgement of God and His prophet."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4OKaz5dzdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modernist+Islam,+1840-1940:+A+Sourcebook+By+Charles+Kurzman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rYP-UKSOC4m70QXR54HYDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA|title=Modernist Islam, 1840–1940|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also very little text actually written down by [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] himself. They all give priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad). They felt that the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad provided people with almost everything they needed. "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion" Quran 5:3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quran.com/5/3 |title=Surat Al-Ma'idah [5:3] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925005700/http://quran.com/5/3 |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy }} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-5/verse-3/ Quran Surah Al-Maaida ( Verse 3 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars did not distinguish between each other. They were not Sunni or Shia. They felt that they were following the religion of Abraham as described in the Quran "Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of the polytheists" (Qur'an 3:95).

Most of the differences are regarding Sharia laws devised through [[Ijtihad]] where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadiths of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] regarding a similar case.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; As these jurists went to new areas, they were pragmatic and continued to use the same ruling as was given in that area during pre-Islamic times, if the population felt comfortable with it, it was just and they used [[Ijtihad]] to deduce that it did not conflict with the Quran or the Hadith. As explained in the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]&lt;ref name="bewley.virtualave.net"/&gt; by [[Malik ibn Anas]].&lt;ref name="Coulson"/&gt; This made it easier for the different communities to integrate into the Islamic State and assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State.

To reduce the divergence, [[ash-Shafi'i]] proposed giving priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad) and only then look at the consensus of the Muslim jurists (''[[ijma]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').&lt;ref name="Coulson"/&gt; This then resulted in jurists like [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/|title=Sahih Bukhari : Read, Study, Search Online|first=Sahih|last=Bukhari|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicating their lives to the collection of the correct Hadith, in books like [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]. Sahih translates as authentic or correct. They also felt that Muhammad's judgement was more impartial and better than their own.

These original jurists and scholars also acted as a counterbalance to the rulers. When they saw injustice, all these scholars spoke out against it. As the state expanded outside Madina, the rights of the different communities, as they were constituted in the [[Constitution of Medina]] still applied. The Quran also gave additional rights to the citizens of the state and these rights were also applied. Ali, Hassan and [[Hussein ibn Ali]] gave their allegiance to the first three caliphs because they abided by these conditions. Later [[Ali]] the fourth caliph wrote in a letter "I did not approach the people to get their oath of allegiance but they came to me with their desire to make me their Amir (ruler). I did not extend my hands towards them so that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their hands towards me".&lt;ref&gt;Nahj ul Balagha Letter 54&lt;/ref&gt; But later as fate would have it ([[Predestination in Islam]]) when [[Yazid I]], an oppressive ruler took power, Hussein ibn Ali the grandson of [[Muhammad]] felt that it was a test from God for him and his duty to confront him. Then [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]]'s cousin confronted the [[Umayyad]] rulers after Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the [[Yazid I]] the Umayyad ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Najeebabadi, Akbar Shah (2001). The History of Islam V.2. Riyadh: Darussalam. p. 110. {{ISBN|9960-892-88-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then took on the Umayyads and expelled their forces from Hijaz and Iraq. But then his forces were depleted in Iraq, trying to stop the Khawarij. The Ummayads then moved in. After a lengthy campaign, in his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother [[Asma' bint Abu Bakr]] the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son, she said:&lt;ref name="ummah.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?347728-The-Advice-of-Asmaa-bint-Abu-Bakr-(ra)-to-her-son-Abdullah-Ibn-Zubair-(ra)|title=The Advice of Asmaa bint Abu Bakr (ra) to her son Abdullah Ibn Zubair (ra)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads and led by Hajjaj. [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] the son of [[Abu Bakr]] the first caliph and raised by [[Ali]] the fourth caliph was also killed by the [[Ummayad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nahj al-Balagha Sermon 71, Letter 27, Letter 34, Letter 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aisha]] then raised and taught his son Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr who later taught his grandson [[Jafar al-Sadiq]].

During the early Ummayad period, there was more community involvement. The Quran and Muhammad's example was the main source of law after which the community decided. If it worked for the community, was just and did not conflict with the Quran and the example of Muhammad, it was accepted. This made it easier for the different communities, with Roman, Persian, Central Asia and North African backgrounds to integrate into the Islamic State and that assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State. The scholars in Madina were consulted on the more complex judicial issues. The Sharia and the official more centralized schools of fiqh developed later, during the time of the Abbasids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of ''fiqh'' in order of importance are
#the [[Qur'an]]
#[[Hadith]]
#[[Ijma]], i.e. collective reasoning and consensus amongst authoritative Muslims of a particular generation, and its interpretation by Islamic scholars.
#[[Qiyas]], i.e. analogy which is deployed if ''Ijma'' or historic collective reasoning on the issue is not available.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Hisham M. |editor1-last=Ramadan|author1=Irshad Abdel Haqq|authorlink1=Islamic law: An Overview of Its Origins and Elements|title=Understanding Islamic Law: From Classical to Contemporary|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZS7EaHTQX8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Islamic+law:+An+Overview+of+Its+Origins+and+Elements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioosO24cnOAhXGNSYKHQImBCgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20law%3A%20An%20Overview%20of%20Its%20Origins%20and%20Elements&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Qur'an]] gives clear instructions on many issues, such as how to perform the ritual purification (''{{lang|ar|[[wudu]]}}'') before the obligatory daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}''), but on other issues, some Muslims believe the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear. For example, the Qur'an states one needs to engage in daily prayers (''{{lang|ar|[[salat]]}}'') and fast (''{{lang|ar|[[sawm]]}}'') during the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] but Muslims believe they need further instructions on how to perform these duties. Details about these issues can be found in the traditions of Muhammad, so [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] are in most cases the basis for (''{{lang|ar|[[Shariah]]}}'').

Some topics are without precedent in Islam's early period. In those cases, Muslim jurists (''{{lang|ar|[[Fuqaha]]}}'') try to arrive at conclusions by other means. [[Sunni]] jurists use historical consensus of the community (''{{lang|ar|[[Ijma]]}}''); a majority in the modern era also use [[analogy]] (''{{lang|ar|[[Qiyas]]}}'') and weigh the harms and benefits of new topics (''{{lang|ar|[[Istislah]]}}''), and a plurality utilizes juristic preference (''{{lang|ar|[[Istihsan]]}}''). The conclusions arrived at with the aid of these additional tools constitute a wider array of laws than the Sharia consists of, and is called '''fiqh'''. Thus, in contrast to the ''sharia'', ''fiqh'' is not regarded as [[sacred]] and the schools of thought have differing views on its details, without viewing other conclusions as [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]]. This division of interpretation in more detailed issues has resulted in different schools of thought (''{{lang|ar|[[madh'hab]]}}'').

This wider concept of '''Islamic jurisprudence''' is the source of a range of laws in different topics that guide Muslims in everyday life.

=== Component categories ===

Islamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') covers two main areas:
# Rules in relation to actions, and,
# Rules in relation to circumstances surrounding actions.

These types of rules can also fall into two groups:
# Worship ([[Ibadah|Ibadaat]])
# Dealings and transactions (with people) ([[Muamalat|Mu`amalaat]])

Rules in relation to actions ('''amaliyya'' — عملية) or "[[Ahkam|decision types]]" comprise:
# Obligation (''[[fardh]]'')
# Recommendation (''[[mustahabb]]'')
# Permissibility (''[[mubah]]'')
# Disrecommendation (''[[makrooh]]'')
# Prohibition (''[[haraam]]'')

Rules in relation to circumstances (''wadia''') comprise:
# Condition (''shart'')
# Cause (''sabab'')
# Preventor (''mani'')
# Permit / Enforced (''rukhsah, azeemah'')
# Valid / Corrupt / Invalid (''sahih, fasid, batil'')
# In time / Deferred / Repeat (''adaa, qadaa, i'ada'')

=== Methodologies of jurisprudence ===
{{main article|Usul al-fiqh}}

The [[modus operandi]] of the Muslim jurist is known as ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' ("principles of jurisprudence").

There are different approaches to the methodology used in jurisprudence to derive Islamic law from the primary sources. The main methodologies are those of the [[Sunni]], [[Shi'a]] and [[Ibadi]] denominations. While both Sunni and [[Shi'ite]] (Shia) are divided into smaller sub-schools, the differences among the Shi'ite schools is considerably greater. Ibadites only follow a single school without divisions.

;Fatawa
While using court decisions as legal precedents and [[case law]] are central to Western law, the importance of the institution of fatawa (non-binding answers by Islamic legal scholars to legal questions) has been called "central to the development" of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:32&gt;[[#MAEGIFLEP2006|El-Gamal, ''Islamic Finance'', 2006]]: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part because of a "vacuum" in the other source of Islamic law, ''qada`'' (legal rulings by state appointed Islamic judges) after the fall of the last [[caliphate]] the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt; While the practice in Islam dates back to the time of Muhammad, according to at least one source (Muhammad El-Gamal), it is "modeled after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] system of ''[[responsa]]''," and gives the questioner "decisive primary-mover advantage in choosing he question and its wording."&lt;ref name=MAEGIFLEP2006:30-1/&gt;

;Arguments for and against reform
Each school (''[[madhhab]]'') reflects a unique ''[[al-urf]]'' or culture (a cultural practice that was influenced by traditions), that the classical jurists themselves lived in, when rulings were made. Some suggest that the discipline of ''[[isnad]]'', which developed to validate ''hadith'' made it relatively easy to record and validate also the rulings of jurists. This, in turn, made them far easier to imitate (''[[taqlid]]'') than to challenge in new contexts. The argument is, the schools have been more or less frozen for centuries, and reflect a culture that simply no longer exists. Traditional scholars hold that religion is there to regulate human behavior and nurture people's moral side and since human nature has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of Islam a call to modernize the religion is essentially one to relax all laws and institutions.

Early ''[[shariah]]'' had a much more flexible character, and some modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and that the classical jurists should lose special status.  This would require formulating a new fiqh suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the [[Islamization of knowledge]], which would deal with the modern context. This modernization is opposed by most conservative ''[[ulema]]''. Traditional scholars hold that the laws are contextual and consider circumstance such as time, place and culture, the principles they are based upon are universal such as justice, equality and respect. Many Muslim scholars argue that even though technology may have advanced, the fundamentals of human life have not.

=== Schools of jurisprudence ===
{{Main article|Madhhab}}
There are several [[Madhhab|schools of fiqh thought]] ({{lang-ar|مذهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏhab}}''; pl. {{lang|ar|مذاهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏāhib}}'')
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|650px|Map of the Muslim world with the main [[madh'hab]]s.]]
The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent]], [[China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Kurdistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], Egypt, [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]]) see [[Wahhabism]]
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists but there are a few texts left of it.

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Twelver|Twelver Shia]]: [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], etc.)
*[[Zaydi]] ([[Yemen]])

Entirely separate from both the Sunni and Shia traditions, [[Khawarij]] Islam has evolved its own distinct school.
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

The relationship between (at least the Sunni) schools of jurisprudence and the conflict between the unity of the Shariah and the diversity of the schools, was expressed by the 12th century Hanafi scholar [[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi]], who wrote: `Our school is correct with the possibility of error, and another school is in error with the possibility of being correct.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

{{main article|Sharia#Classic Islamic law|l1=Sharia: Classic Islamic law}}

A number of important legal [[institution]]s were developed by Muslim jurists during the classical period of Islam, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. One such institution was the ''[[Hawala]]'', an early [[informal value transfer system]], which is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence as early as the 8th century. ''Hawala'' itself later influenced the development of the [[Agency (law)|agency]] in [[common law]] and in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]] such as the ''aval'' in [[Law of France|French law]] and the ''avallo'' in [[Italy|Italian]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems |first=Gamal Moursi |last=Badr |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=26 |issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977 |date=Spring 1978 |pages=187–198 [196–98] |doi=10.2307/839667 |publisher=American Society of Comparative Law |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "European [[Limited partnership|commenda]]" (Islamic ''[[Qirad]]'') used in European civil law may have also originated from Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;

The ''[[Waqf]]'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which developed during the 7th–9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the [[Charitable trust|trusts]] in the English [[trust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every ''Waqf'' was required to have a ''waqif'' (settlor), ''mutawillis'' (trustee), ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) and beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1237–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust law developed in [[England]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], during the 12th and 13th centuries, was introduced by Crusaders who may have been influenced by the ''Waqf'' institutions they came across in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hudson|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaudiosi|1988|pp=1244–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic ''lafif'' was a body of twelve members drawn from the [[neighbourhood]] and sworn to tell the truth, who were bound to give a unanimous [[verdict]], about matters "which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the [[Qadi|judge]], to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the [[plaintiff]]." The only characteristic of the English jury which the Islamic ''lafif'' lacked was the "judicial [[writ]] directing the jury to be summoned and directing the [[bailiff]] to hear its recognition." According to Professor John Makdisi, "no other institution in any legal institution studied to date shares all of these characteristics with the English jury." It is thus likely that the concept of the ''lafif'' may have been introduced to [[England]] by the [[Normans]], who [[Norman conquest of England|conquered both England]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and then evolved into the modern English jury.&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Harvnb|Makdisi|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other fundamental [[common law]] institutions may have been adapted from similar legal institutions in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and jurisprudence, and introduced to England by the [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Emirate of Sicily, and by Crusaders during the [[Crusades]]. In particular, the "royal English [[contract]] protected by the action of [[debt]] is identified with the Islamic ''Aqd'', the English [[assize of novel disseisin]] is identified with the Islamic ''Istihqaq'', and the English [[jury]] is identified with the Islamic ''lafif''." Other English legal institutions such as "the [[scholastic method]], the [[licence]] to [[Education|teach]]", the "[[law school]]s known as [[Inns of Court]] in England and ''[[Madrasah|Madrasas]]'' in Islam" and the "European [[Limited partnership|commenda]]" (Islamic ''[[Qirad]]'') may have also originated from Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; The methodology of [[Precedent|legal precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]'') are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems.&lt;ref name=Gamal&gt;{{cite book |title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice |first=Mahmoud A. |last=El-Gamal |year=2006 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-86414-3 |page=16 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These influences have led some scholars to suggest that Islamic law may have laid the foundations for "the common law as an integrated whole".&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;

The '''Fletcher Foundation''' is a nonprofit foundation that supports [[civil rights]], [[education]], and [[environmental education]].  The foundation supports efforts to develop a more just society with more equal opportunities for more of the population primarily by leveraging the financial and non-financial contributions of Fletcher Asset Management, the Fletcher Family including New York financier and philanthropist [[Buddy Fletcher|Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;http://fletcherphilanthropy.org&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Fletcher Asset Management has been accused of fraud related to its management of funds and the value of pledges Fletcher's charitable pledges are in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theday.com/article/20131215/NWS01/312159915/Waterford-success-story-Buddy-Fletcher-accused-of-fraud Waterford success story Buddy Fletcher accused of fraud] 12/15/2014 The Day&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Fletcher worked in investment banking and in 1991 founded Fletcher Asset Management. A Harvard Class Marshal, Fletcher endowed a University Professorship at his alma mater, first held by philosopher [[Cornel West]] and now held by literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]]. In 2004, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the Fletcher Foundation announced the creation of the Alphonse Fletcher, Sr. Fellowship program, described by foundation chair Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as "Guggenheims for race issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses Fletcher Fellowship Awarded to Bob Moses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113224256/http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses |date=2007-11-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural class of Fletcher Fellows, each awarded $50,000, was selected in 2006.

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

== Themes ==

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuseNet''' is an organization that unites, coordinates and sponsors European educational efforts in the field of [[nuclear fusion]] in order to increase, enhance, and broaden fusion training and education activities in [[Europe]].

== The FP7 Project ==
The FuseNet project exists of the establishment of a European Fusion Education Network (FuseNet) for education in fusion science and technology. The purpose of FuseNet is to coordinate and facilitate fusion education, to share best practices, to jointly develop educational tools, to organize educational events. The members of FuseNet have jointly established academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master Certificates. These criteria are set to stimulate a high level of fusion education throughout Europe.

The FuseNet project started in October 2008 as a Coordination and Support Action under the [[seventh Framework Programme]], with financial support of the [[European Commission]]. The project consists of eleven focused work packages, with a total budget of 2 Million Euro. The project runs until October 1, 2013 and is bringing together a broad representation from the European fusion community with 36 participants from 18 countries, of which 22 Universities and 14 Euratom Associations.

The project consists of four groups of coordination actions: the establishment and running of the FuseNet network; development of individual learning opportunities and common educational goals; development of educational materials and hands-on experiments; and funding of joint educational activities.

== The Association ==
The FuseNet Association is an independent legal entity that was founded in December 2010 to form the sustainable continuation of the activities started by the equally named FuseNet project. The association provides a platform for the coordination of European fusion education activities, the initiation, development and implementation of new EU-wide actions, and for the exchange and dissemination of fusion education information. All European organizations that are active in the field of fusion education and research are welcome to join the association.
FuseNet is the umbrella organization and single voice for the training and education of the next generation fusion engineers and scientists. FuseNet is recognized as such by the European Commission.

'''Genome Canada''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that aims to use [[genomics]]-based technologies to improve the lives of [[Canadians|Canadian]]s. It is funded by the [[Government of Canada]]. Genome Canada provides large-scale investments that develop new technologies, connect the public sector with private industry, and create solutions to problems of national interest, such as health, sustainable resources, the environment, and energy.

Genome Canada also funds research on the ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social aspects of genomics, which they call '''GE&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LS''' (the same research direction is called [[Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects research|ELSI]] or [[Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects research|ELSA]] in the United States and in Europe, respectively). This includes topics such as [[genetic privacy]] and [[genetic discrimination]], as well as public acceptance of [[genetically modified organisms]]. Genome Canada researchers generate policy briefs on these and other topics.

Currently, there are six regional genome centres in Canada that receive funding from Genome Canada:
*[http://www.genomebc.ca Genome British Columbia]
*[http://genomealberta.ca Genome Alberta]
*[http://www.genomeprairie.ca Genome Prairie]
*[http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics]
*[http://www.genomequebec.com/en/home.html Genome Québec]
*[http://genomeatlantic.ca Genome Atlantic]

Between 2000 and 2017, Genome Canada provided 1.5 billion [[Canadian dollars]] in genomics funding, which has attracted an additional [[Canadian dollars|C$]] 2.1 billion in co-funding from partners in the private, public and non-profit sectors within Canada and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/about-us/accountability/co-funding Co-Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

The President and CEO of Genome Canada is Marc LePage. The current Chair of the Board is Moura Quayle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==
[[Image:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Replica catapult at [[Château des Baux]], [[France]]]]
While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==
{{see also|Technology during World War I}}
[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18192">{{Inca civilization}}'''Incan architecture''' is the most significant [[pre-Columbian]] [[architecture]] in [[South America]]. The Incas inherited an architectural legacy from [[Tiwanaku]], founded in the 2nd century B.C.E. in present-day [[Bolivia]].  A core characteristic of the architectural style was to use the topography and existing materials of the land as part of the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Carolyn|date=2007|title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place|url=|journal=Art Bulletin|volume=LXXXIX|pages=502–517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of the Inca empire, [[Cusco|Cuzco]], still contains many fine examples of Inca architecture, although many walls of Inca masonry have been incorporated into [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] structures. The famous royal estate of [[Machu Picchu]] (Machu Pikchu) is a surviving example of Inca architecture.  Other significant sites include [[Sacsayhuamán]] and [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Incas also developed an extensive road system spanning most of the western length of the continent and placed their distinctive architecture along the way, thereby visually asserting their imperial rule along the frontier.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dean |first1=Carolyn |title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place |journal=The Art Bulletin |date=2007 |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=502–518 |doi=10.1080/00043079.2007.10786358 |jstor=25067338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Inca buildings were made out of [[fieldstone]]s or semi-worked stone blocks and dirt set in [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; [[adobe]] walls were also quite common, usually laid over stone foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The material used in the Inca buildings depended on the region, for instance, in the coast they used large rectangular adobe blocks while in the Andes they used local stones.&lt;ref&gt;Vergara, Teresa, “Arte y Cultura del Tahuantinsuyo”, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common shape in Inca architecture was the rectangular building without any internal walls and roofed with wooden beams and [[thatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several variations of this basic design, including [[gabled roof]]s, rooms with one or two of the long sides opened and rooms that shared a long wall.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''inca settlement'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Rectangular buildings were used for quite different functions in almost all Inca buildings, from humble houses to palaces and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, there are some examples of curved walls on Inca buildings, mostly in regions outside the central area of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-story buildings were infrequent; when they were built the second floor was accessed from the outside via a stairway or high terrain rather than from the first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wall apertures, including doors, niches and windows, usually had a [[trapezoidal]] shape; they could be fitted with double or triple [[jamb]]s as a form of ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of decoration were scarce; some walls were painted or adorned with metal plaques, in rare cases walls were sculpted with small animals or geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CuscoPiedra12angulo.jpg|thumb|[[Twelve-angled stone]] in the Hatun Rumiyoc street of Cusco, is an example of Inca masonry]]
The most common composite form in Inca architecture was the ''kancha'', a rectangular enclosure housing three or more rectangular buildings placed symmetrically around a central courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kancha'' units served widely different purposes as they formed the basis of simple dwellings as well as of temples and palaces; furthermore, several ''kancha''  could be grouped together to form blocks in Inca settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; A testimony of the importance of these compounds in Inca architecture is that the central part of the Inca capital of [[Cusco]] consisted of large ''kancha'', including [[Qurikancha]] and the Inca palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 181, 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved examples of ''kancha'' are found at [[Ollantaytambo]], an Inca settlement located along the [[Urubamba River]].&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inca architecture is widely known for its fine masonry, which features precisely cut and shaped stones closely fitted without mortar ("[[dry stone|dry]]").&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this fame, most Inca buildings were actually made out of fieldstone and adobe as described above.&lt;ref&gt;Protzen, ''Inca architecture'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, American archaeologist [[John H. Rowe]] classified Inca fine masonry in two types: coursed, which features rectangular shaped stones, and polygonal, which features blocks of irregular shape.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, ''An introduction'', pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, Peruvian architect Santiago Agurto established four subtypes by dividing the categories identified by Rowe:&lt;ref&gt;Agurto, ''Estudios acerca'', pp. 144–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cellular polygonal masonry: with small blocks
* [[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry: with very large stones
* Encased coursed masonry: in which stone blocks are not aligned
* Sedimentary coursed masonry: in which stones are laid out in horizontal rows (i.e., [[ashlar]]s)
The first two types were used on important buildings or perimeter walls while the last two were employed mostly on terrace walls and river canalization.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walls at Sacsayhuaman.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ashlar]] polygonal masonry at [[Sacsayhuamán]]]]
According to [[Graziano Gasparini]] and Luise Margolies, Inca stonemasonry was inspired by the architecture of [[Tiwanaku]], an archaeological site in modern Bolivia built several centuries before the Inca Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that according to [[ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] accounts the Incas were impressed by these monuments and employed large numbers of stoneworkers from nearby regions in the construction of their own buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these references, they also identified some formal similarities between Tiwanaku and Inca architecture including the use of cut and polished stone blocks, as well as of double jambs.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini and Margolies, ''Inca architecture'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with this hypothesis is the question of how was expertise preserved in the three hundred years between the collapse of Tiwanaku and the appearance of the Inca Empire and its architecture. As a solution, John Hyslop has argued that the Tiahuanaco stonemasonry tradition was preserved in the [[Lake Titicaca]] region in sites such as [[Tanka Tanka]], which features walls resembling Inca polygonal masonry.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major influence on Inca architecture came from the [[Wari culture|Wari]] culture, a civilization contemporary to Tiwanaku. According to Ann Kendall, the Huari introduced their tradition of building rectangular enclosures in the Cusco region, which formed a model for the development of the Inca ''kancha''.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, ''Aspects of Inca architecture'', p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that such traditions were preserved in the Cusco region after the decline of the Wari as is attested by the enclosures found at sites such as [[Choquequirao]] (Chuqi K'iraw), 28 kilometers southeast of the Inca capital.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop, ''Inka settlement'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water engineer Ken Wright estimates that 60 percent of the Inca construction effort was underground. The Inca built their cities with locally available materials, usually including [[limestone]] or granite. To cut these hard rocks the Inca used stone, bronze or copper tools, usually splitting the stones along the natural fracture lines. Without the wheel the stones were rolled up with wood beams on earth ramps. Extraordinary manpower would have been necessary. Hyslop comments that the 'secret' to the production of fine Inca masonry “…was the social organization necessary to maintain the great numbers of people creating such energy-consuming monuments.” It is speculated that the stones were swung into place using friction to create perfectly convex and concave sides. Visible marks of facture like stone bosses were made using rope; these elements demonstrated the artistic value of labor and the power of Inca rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=2881b5f8-8bb4-4c01-b8ac-f417feea55a3@sessionmgr4008&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=26518585&amp;db=aph|title=The Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place.|last=Dean|first=Carolyn|date=|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the walls of Incan buildings were slightly inclined inside and the corners were rounded. This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a peerless [[seismic resistance]] thanks to high static and dynamic steadiness, absence of [[resonance|resonant]] [[frequency|frequencies]] and [[stress concentration]] points. During an [[earthquake]] with a small or moderate magnitude, masonry was stable, and during a strong earthquake stone blocks were “ dancing ” near their normal positions and lay down exactly in right order after an earthquake.

Another building method was called "pillow-faced" architecture. Pillow faced building was achieved by using fired adobe bricks. The Incas would then sand large, finely shaped stones, and then they would fit the bricks and stones together in jigsaw like patterns. Pillow-faced architecture was typically used for temples and royal places like Machu Picchu.

[[Ashlar]] masonry was used in the most sacred, elite Inca structure; for example, the Acllawasi ("House of the Chosen Woman"), the [[Coricancha]] ("Golden Enclosure") in Cuzco, and the Sun Temple at Machu Picchu. Thus it seems that ashlar may have been more greatly valued by the Inca, perhaps considered more difficult than polygonal ("pillow-faced") masonry. Though polygonal masonry may be aesthetically more impressive, the facture of ashlar masonry tends to be unforgiving to mistakes; if a corner is broken in the process it can be reshaped to fit into the mosaic of polygonal masonry whereas you cannot recover a damaged rock in ashlar masonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At Home with the Sapa Inca: Architecture, Space, and Legacy at Chinchero|last=Nair|first=Stella|publisher=University of Texas Print|year=2015|isbn=1477302506|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism and Patronage ==

=== Aesthetics: Combining the Built and Natural Environments ===
Inca architecture is strongly characterized by its use of the natural environment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/chapter-pdf/497021/9780822393177-005.pdf|title=Rock and Rule {{!}} A Culture of StoneInka Perspectives on Rock {{!}} Books Gateway {{!}} Duke University Press|website=read.dukeupress.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inca managed to seamlessly merge their architecture into the surrounding land and its specificities.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=At Home with the Sapa Inca : Architecture, Space, and Legacy at Chinchero|last=Nair|first=Stella|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=9781477302491|location=University of Texas|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak, the [[Inca Empire]] spanned from [[Ecuador]] to [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire|title=Inca Empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}  Yet despite geographic variances, Inca architecture remained consistent in its ability to visually blend the built and natural environment.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In particular, Inca walls practiced mortarless [[masonry]] and used partially worked, irregularly shaped rocks to complement the organic qualities and diversity of the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Callachaca: Style and Status in an Inca Community|last=Niles|first=Susan A.|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=1987|isbn=9781587291685|location=University of Iowa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the dry fitted masonry techniques of caninacukpirca, the Incas shaped their stone to conceal natural outcrops, fit tight crevices, and ultimately incorporate the landscape into their infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The Inca also used natural [[bedrock]] as their structural foundations (to help keep the buildings stable).&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;  This pragmatically stabilized their structures built in the [[Andes]] mountain range of [[South America]], while aesthetically disguising the boundaries between mountain and edifice.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  In combination, the diversity of stone shape, materiality, and facture all furthered the naturalistic illusion of the Inca's built environment.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/chapter-pdf/497015/9780822393177-002.pdf|title=IntroductionComing to Terms with Inka Rocks {{!}} A Culture of StoneInka Perspectives on Rock {{!}} Books Gateway {{!}} Duke University Press|website=read.dukeupress.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics: Expansionist and Subservient Ideologies ===
Inca employment and integration of the natural environment into their architecture played an essential role in their program of civilizational expansion and cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;   Patronage of powerful elites and rulers of the [[Inca Empire|Inca empire]] was a major impetus behind the construction of Inca structures, and much of the remaining architecture we see today was most likely royal estates or mobile capitals for [[Sapa Inca]] to inhabit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  The Sapa Inca naturalized and asserted their political rule through their palaces' aesthetic appeal to a reciprocal relationship between their imperialism and the earth itself.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  The blended, architectural aesthetic colored their political expansion in a sense of inseparable, timeless, and spiritual authority.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;For example, in the royal estate of [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]], the Incas adapted their large-scale earthwork and massive stone construction to the land's dramatically steep valley in order to create intense, visual drama.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Similarly to the architecture of other mountainous Inca citadels, such as [[Machu Picchu]], the Chinchero estate's dynamic construction into the severe landscape demonstrated the raw, physical power of the Incas, and projected an authoritative aura for those who approached.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The actual process of constructing the royal palaces served as an additional royal tactic of maintaining rule.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Inca architecture demonstrates a commitment to the culturally pervasive, yet more physically difficult, process of mortarless, [[polygonal masonry]] and conscious accommodation of a land's natural [[topography]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  The upholding of these non-[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] practices of construction can give insight into Inca values concerning the artistic integrity and cultural meaning embedded within the process of building estates,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; and how the building of royal palaces can be understood as a physical enactment of political loyalty and communal subservience to the Sapa Inca.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Jack Firestein''' (1917–2004) was British Socialist and Labour activist.

==Life==
He was born in [[Whitechapel]], London, England, to an eastern European Jewish family, he left school when he was 14 to follow his father as a tailor, he later became a bookseller, a profession he continued most of his life. In the early 1930s Firestein joined [[the Communist Party]].  In 1936, he was involved in the '[[Battle of Cable Street]]', when [[Oswald Mosley]]'s Blackshirts were routed by a mobilisation of East End workers. In the [[Second World War]] he joined the [[Royal Fusiliers]] who were involved in the Italian campaigns in [[Italy]]. He was seriously injured when a bullet passed through his body in the battle of [[Anzio]], where he was taken prisoner by the Germans. Jack was subsequently awarded the [[Military Medal]].

After the war he went back to the book trade and in the 1950s he ran the [[Unity Theatre, London]] Folk Club in London for more than 16 years, until the theatre was burnt down in 1975.  He also worked as a chauffeur for [[Clive Jenkins]] a British trade union leader for many years.  He left the Communist Party in 1956 after the [[Soviet Union]] suppression of the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] that year.

He joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and remained a member until his death, He ran an open-air book stall outside of the headquarters of Camden Labour Party – although his disillusionment with the party led him to join the then recently formed [[Respect Party]] without renouncing his Labour Party membership.  He was deeply involved with his local Neighbourhood Advice Centre as a trustee on the management board, and he also dedicated many hours to helping others with welfare problems.

In 2009, Chris Reeves, a London filmmaker of Platform films, made a film remembrance of his life entitled "Only a Bookseller". It was accepted into the 2010 [[Canadian Labour International Film Festival (CLiFF)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">"'''Joke'''" is a [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] written and performed by [[English people|English]] [[comedian]]s [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. It was performed live during Atkinson's 1980 tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. A live recording was made at the [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on 19 or 20 September 1980 and released as the last track on Atkinson's [[live album|live]] comedy [[album]], ''[[Live in Belfast]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the start of the sketch, Rowan Atkinson's character tells Richard Curtis' character he's "got a [[joke]]". He goes on to explain, "It's one of those ones where I ask a question and you say 'I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot'." Rowan begins the joke by saying, "I say, I say, I say, what is the secret of great comedy?" Richard replies by literally saying, "I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot." After laughing at his own wit, Richard tells the annoyed Rowan that he'll "do it again." Rowan repeats the question and Richard replies, "I don't know. What is the secret to great comedy?" However, before Richard can finish his reply, Rowan interrupts, "timing." The point of the joke is that Rowan deliberately got his timing wrong when saying that timing is the secret to great comedy; however, Richard does not understand the joke. Bewildered by Richard's stupidity, Rowan enquires, "But didn't you see?" "Sorry, was it a visual joke?" Richard replies, still confused. After trying the joke a third time, Richard still does not understand the [[irony]] of the joke. Annoyed by Richard, Rowan asks, "Don't you think that's a clever joke?" to which Richard replies, "Clever... no. Joke... no." Disheartened by his joke falling flat with Richard, he claims "it was very funny when Michael told it," then makes the excuse that his timing might be out to which Richard replies, "It could be other factors like the complete absence of anything funny in the joke." Rowan proclaims, "It's so difficult telling jokes," before suddenly exclaiming that he has another joke that is "far more straightforward" to which Richard replies, "As long as it's funny, I don't mind."

The second joke begins with Rowan saying, "Knock! Knock! Who's there? Death..." but he is interrupted by Richard who complains that [[knock-knock joke]]s "are meant to be two-handers". Rowan argues that this joke "doesn't work that way". It becomes apparent that Rowan is attempting to tell the same joke told by Toby, the [[Devil]], during a previous sketch. The joke is meant to go "Knock, Knock. Who's there? Death. Death wh..." at which point the person telling the joke pretends to die. If a second person was replying in the joke, they would not know to pretend to die when saying "Death who?". Richard protests and Rowan gives in and the pair attempt the knock-knock joke in the "old way". Richard, ignorant to the fact he is meant to say the [[punch line]], replies "Death who?" and Rowan replies "Ah, now, that's where it goes wrong." Rowan explains to Richard how he is meant to say the punch-line but after another attempt at the joke, Richard replies wrong. Rowan, getting increasingly more annoyed as the sketch goes on, says he has another joke and this time he will be "third time lucky".

Rowan explains that the third joke is "a very old joke but a very good joke". Rowan begins to tell the classic joke, which begins "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to [[Jamaica]]". The person replying is meant to say, "Jamaica?" which sounds like "D'you make 'er?" or "Did you make her?". The joke-teller then replies, "No, of her own accord." However, when Rowan says, "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to Jamaica," Richard replies, "Of her own accord?" which ruins the whole joke and causes Rowan to [[profanity|swear]] loudly and give up telling jokes to Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online. Retrieved September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed under ''Best of the Web'' by [[New York Public Library]] and had previously been rewarded ''Site of the Month'' by ''LibrarySpot''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/2166 Best of the Web]'', [[New York Public Library]], USA. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.libraryspot.com/lsom/1999/libsiteofmonth0799.htm Congratulations to Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]'', [http://www.libraryspot.com/ Library Spot]. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">This is a '''list of musicology topics'''. [[Musicology]] is the scholarly study of [[music]]. A person who studies music is a musicologist. The word is used in narrow, intermediate and broad senses. In the narrow sense, musicology is confined to the music history of [[Western culture]]. In the intermediate sense, it includes all relevant cultures and a range of musical forms, styles, genres and traditions, but tends to be confined to the [[humanities]] - a combination of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and the humanities of systematic musicology ([[philosophy]], [[Sociological theory|theoretical sociology]], [[aesthetics]]). In the broad sense, it includes all musically relevant [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] (both humanities and [[science]]s) and all manifestations of music in all [[culture]]s, so it also includes all of systematic musicology (including [[psychology]], [[biology]], and [[computing]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35491">'''Migrant sex work''' is the work done by [[migrant worker]]s in [[prostitution]]. Migrant sex work is significant because of its role as a dominant demographic of commercial sex workers internationally. Migrant sex work shares several similarities across various contexts, such as their [[Human migration|migration]] from rural to urban areas or between developing to industrialized nations and the economic push and pull factors that help determine their migrant status. Migrant sex workers have also been at the center of complex discussions over the legality of sex work, the differentiation or conflation of [[sex work]] from [[sex trafficking]], and responses from national governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s over the regulation of sex work and the provision of services for victims of sex trafficking.

==Demographics and background==
The illegal nature of migrant sex work makes it difficult to obtain reliable and conclusive estimates of migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=AugustinA&gt;Augustin, Laura. 2006. “The Disappearing of a Category: Migrants Who Sell Sex.” ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'' 32(1):29-47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, social scientists have discovered significant trends regarding the identity of migrant sex workers. While migrants who work in agriculture or construction are largely male, migrants who engage in commercial sex work are largely female with ages ranging from the early teens to middle age.&lt;ref name=AugustinB&gt;Agustín, Laura. 2007. ''Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry.'' London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant sex workers make up significant proportions of the sex worker population in many countries, with estimates ranging from 37% in the UK &lt;ref&gt;UK Network of Sex Work Projects. 2008. "Working with  Migrant Sex Workers." Manchester, United Kingdom: UK Network of Sex Work Projects&lt;/ref&gt; to 90% in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;TAMPEP international Foundation. 2009. “Sex Work in Europe.” European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brothel price sign for various nationalities on Soy St., HK.JPG|thumb|Brothel price sign for sex workers of various nationalities on Soy Street, Hong Kong]]

Migrant sex workers are diverse in terms of nationality of origin. In certain national contexts, such as in the United Arab Emirates, sex workers come from a diverse range of nations of origin, such as Russia, Nigeria, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=mahdavi&gt;Mahdavi, Pardis. 2011. ''Gridlock: Labor, Migration, and Human Trafficking in Dubai''. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of sex workers in large Dutch cities, for instance, are women of color from developing nations.&lt;ref name=kempadoo&gt;Kempadoo, Kamala. 2001. “Women of Color and the Global Sex Trade: Transnational Feminist Perspectives.” ''Meridians'' 1(2):28-51.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, what distinguishes migrant sex workers from local sex workers are primarily their low [[socioeconomic status]], primarily illegal immigration status, and poor language skills.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA&gt;Bernstein, Elizabeth. 2007. Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in their frequent marginalization in the unregulated and dangerous sectors of the [[prostitution|sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Julia O'Connell. 2005. ''Children in the Global Sex Trade.'' London: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for migration and sex work===

====Reasons for migration====
Low economic status and harsh living conditions in migrant sex workers' home country often serve as push factors for migration to more economically advantaged nations. Vast migration between third and first world countries in response to diminishing economic prospects at home has been prevalent since [[economic globalization]] widened the income gap between developed and developing nations.&lt;ref name="EhrenreichHoch"&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara and Hochschild, Arlie. 2004. Global Woman: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York, NY: Holt&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the number of international migrants doubled between 1960 and 2005.&lt;ref name=morrison&gt;Morrison, Andrew R., Maurice Schiff, and Mirja Sjoblom, eds. 2008. The International Migration of Women. ''The World Bank''.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[international migration]] has increasingly become [[Feminization of migration|feminized]], with females making up 50% of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;

====Reasons for sex work====
Migrants enter sex work for a variety of reasons. Female migrants largely migrate for jobs in the [[care work|care sector]], such as [[domestic work]], [[childcare]], and [[sex work]], as opposed to males who engage in more physically demanding labor, such as [[construction]] and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="EhrenreichHoch"/&gt; Some migrants may have originally intended to work in commercial sex while others found themselves turning to commercial sex after alternate labor means failed or proved to be less lucrative.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt; Others may engage in sex work as a result of situations involving the need to pay off debts incurred during migration or fees to a wide variety of middlemen who may help secure papers, travel passage, and places of work.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt;

For women who engage in rural to urban migration in developing nations with growing [[free trade zones]] and importation of foreign financial capital and [[tourism]], sex work is often more lucrative than alternative forms of labor, such as [[sweatshop|working in manufacturing or in factories]] subcontracting to foreign corporations.&lt;ref name=kempadoo/&gt; Women can choose to engage in commercial sex over these forms of labor, or use sex work to supplement other labor activities, such as domestic work.&lt;ref name=kempadoo/&gt;

==Problems in data and research==
Several scholars have noted the growing number of academic studies, news media coverage, and government and NGO reports on migrant sex workers, victims of sex trafficking, and the overlap between these two groups.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As the perception of an international sex trafficking pandemic grows, there have been a large number of attempts to count the number of individuals who engage in some sort of migration and sex work, either voluntarily or coerced.&lt;ref name="tyldum"&gt;Tyldum, Guri and Anette Brunovskis. JH. 2005. "Human Trafficking in East Asia: Current Trends, Data Collection, and Knowledge Gaps." Pp. 165-202 in Data and research on human trafficking: A global survey edited by Laczko, Frank and Gozdziak, Elzbieta. Geneva: International Organization for Migration.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars and activists have often criticized the methodologies of these studies and the motivations behind them.

===Conflation of sex work and sex trafficking===
Because prostitution can be an extremely political topic that represents differing political interests, the method of data collection and the use of collected data can vary in reliability.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; While more pro-sex work academics, organizations, and activists make an explicit demarcation between sex workers and victims of sex trafficking, many other groups consider prostitution to inherently lack a voluntary component. Many anti-sex work activists consider any form of migration for the purpose of commercial sex to be a form of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt; As a result, depending on the definition of human trafficking by the organization or data collector, the number of either migrant sex workers or victims of sex trafficking can dramatically change depending on whether or not these two categories of individuals are conflated. Scholars, service providers, and practitioners who attempt to remain apolitical and outside the [[Feminist views on prostitution|feminist views on sex trafficking and sex work]] regarding prostitution still often remark how the legal definitions of human trafficking are still too vague for them to efficiently and neutrally define and count victims.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As a result, who is considered to be a migrant sex worker or victim of sex trafficking can widely vary.

===Illegality of sex work===
The illegal nature of either the [[illegal immigration|migration]], [[prostitution law|sex work]], or both components of migrant sex work make it difficult to obtain reliable and conclusive estimates of migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name="AugustinA"/&gt; Scholars Guri Tyldum and Anette Brunovski call sex workers "hidden populations" which they define as "A group of individuals for whom the size and boundaries are unknown,and for whom no sampling frame exists."&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; The reasons why a sampling frame does not exist lies in the illegal and stigmatized nature of sex work. In order to protect their identity from law enforcement and family members, sex workers are often unwilling to participate in studies and surveys that may compromise their privacy and identity.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt;

===Diversity in migrant sex work===
Migrant sex work is also incredibly diverse due to the large number of countries and migration contexts that are involved.&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;Brennan, Denise. 2005. “Methodological Challenges in Research with Trafficked Persons: Tales from the Field.” International Migration 43:35-54.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statistically generalizable portrait of migrant sex workers' day-to-day lives, living and working conditions, and relationships with other sex workers, clients, or third party intermediaries. Studies are unlikely to capture the sheer diversity in migrant sex worker experiences, especially when many of them come from selective samples, such as from a sex worker service provider or even shelter for human trafficking victims.,&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As a result, many scholars caution against accepting any survey or study of sex workers as generalizable.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==Relationship with human trafficking==
{{See also|human trafficking}}

===Risk of human trafficking===
Because of their illegal and vulnerable economic status, some migrant sex workers may find themselves in situations where coercion and forced sex work may be present. Under international legal definitions of human trafficking, forced and coercive forms of sex work are considered to be instances of involuntary sex trafficking. However, many scholars caution against categorizing sex workers as either completely voluntary or completely involuntary.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt; They often argue that sex work, like other forms of labor, can span a spectrum between the two extremes, with most circumstances falling in the middle through various labor rights violations.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt; Nevertheless, the vulnerability of migrant sex workers can make them susceptible to exploitative or coercive labor practices that can resemble or be human trafficking.

===Conflation with human trafficking===
Whether or not [[human trafficking]] and migrant sex work should be considered the same concept has been a contentious debate among feminist activists, government officials, scholars, and religious organizations for the past 15 years.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; This debate currently dominates much of the public discussion surrounding human trafficking and sex work.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; On one side of the debate are anti-prostitution activists who [[Feminist views on prostitution|conflate migrant sex work and human trafficking]] because they do not believe in voluntary prostitution or because they view any migration for the purpose of sex work as human trafficking.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; This perspective has largely dominated mainstream governmental and NGO perspectives toward human trafficking across international contexts.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;  On the other side of the debate are pro-sex work academics and activists who argue for the separation of voluntary migrant sex work from involuntary human trafficking and a greater focus on labor and migration rights instead of trafficking. This group works for the recognition of the right of prostitutes to pursue sex work as a legitimate form of work, more flexible and open borders for migrants, and a greater focus on the spectrum of coercive labor conditions.&lt;ref name="doezema"&gt;Doezema, Jo. 2002. “Who Gets to Choose?: Coercion, Consent, and the UN Trafficking Protocol.” Gender and Development 10(1):20-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work and sex trafficking conflation is also a heavily debated legal topic. Several scholars argue that existing legal provisions aimed at combating human trafficking, such as the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the 2000 United Nations [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], do not adequately account for the variety of sex worker conditions and contexts, voluntary or involuntary.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt; For instance, Filipina hostesses who migrate to Japan to work as entertainers must give up their legal documents to their recruiters during the migration process.&lt;ref&gt;Parrenas, Rhacel. 2011. Illicit Flirtations. Palo Alto: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the law considers the process of giving up a passport to a third party intermediary as a condition of human trafficking, several scholars, activists, and the sex workers themselves do not regard this to be human trafficking, particularly when individuals consent to this component of the migration process.

Issues surrounding the definition of [[Feminist views on prostitution|human trafficking in relation to sex work]] and migration situations have contributed to a highly contentious debate and has played a prominent role in structuring how governments have responded to migrant sex workers in terms of viewing them as unwilling victims of a crime or as criminals themselves.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;Altman, Dennis. 2001. ''Global Sex.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Migration and legal status===
Many migrant sex workers migrate illegally or become illegal migrants after leaving previously legal statuses and jobs for sex work.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; Illegal migrant status can heavily restrict sex worker access to legal alternatives to sex work,  legal sex work venues, and government-provided social services. The consequences are that migrant sex workers are unable to turn to [[law enforcement]] during sexual assaults and rapes or access services available to sex workers with appropriate legal status and citizenship. The possibility of facing deportation and [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration sentiments]] are critical ways in which migrant sex workers are marginalized.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt; Migrant workers who initially migrate under legal means can become illegal migrants in violation of their visas if they decide to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="mahdavi"/&gt;

Migrant sex workers who have legal status largely do not exist for two reasons. First, governments with legal sex industries typically do not allow foreign nationals to participate legally. New Zealand and Australia are two examples that prohibit foreign individuals with various visa statuses from participating in sex work, making individuals who choose to do so anyway illegal under immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/immigrationfraud/ |title=New Zealand Visas|work=immigration.govt.nz|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eleanor, 2011, "Industry calls for migrant sex worker visas", ABC News, November 18&lt;/ref&gt; Second, governments that do not have legal sex industries typically allow the entrance of foreign nationals who are currently working as prostitutes or have a history of prostitution.

===Legality of sex work===
{{See also|Prostitution law}}

The legal status of sex work varies in various different national contexts around the world. Scholar Janie Chuang identifies the following four regulatory models for prostitution:&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

[[File:Prostitution laws of the world2.PNG|thumb|right|250px|{{legend|#00ffff|Decriminalization - No criminal penalties for prostitution}}
{{legend|#008000|Legalization -prostitution legal and regulated}}
{{legend|#336699|Abolitionism - prostitution is legal, but organized activities such as brothels and pimping are illegal; prostitution is ''not'' regulated}}
{{legend|#ff7f00|Neo-abolitionism illegal to buy sex and for 3rd party involvement, legal to sell sex}}
{{legend|#FF0000|Prohibitionism - prostitution illegal}}
{{legend|#585858|Legality varies with local laws}}]]

* '''Complete criminalization''': Prohibition of prostitution for all parties (prostitute, clients, and pimps)
* '''Partial criminalization''': Prohibition of prostitution for all parties, except for prostitutes. This is popularly known as the [[prostitution in Sweden|Swedish Model]] which does not criminalize the prostitute, but rather targets the clients and pimps.
* '''Decriminalization''': Does not consider prostitution a crime. Law enforcement is only involved when acts under criminal law occur.
* '''Legalization''': Active regulation of prostitution through licensing, zoning, and mandatory health measures.

Proponents of legalizing prostitution often argue that legalization will provide regulation and benefits to an industry that suffers from negative externalities as a direct result of its illegal status, such as the inability of sex workers to seek legal action towards violent customers or exploitative labor conditions.&lt;ref name=chuang&gt;Chuang, Janie. 2010. "Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy.” 158 ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' 1655.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for partial criminalization argue that making the act of buying sex, as opposed to selling sex, illegal will eliminate unequal penalties that are traditionally felt by the sex worker, especially when the sex worker is not voluntarily participating in commercial sex.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

However, legalization of sex work does not mean all sex workers benefit.&lt;ref name="bernsteinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Even in situations where sex work is decriminalized and legalized, such as in [[Prostitution in Denmark|Denmark]], the migrant sex worker population is often negatively affected. In the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], when sex work is legalized, the legal benefits are largely accrued only by sex workers who have legal status or Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt; As a result, the illegal migrant sex worker population that comprises 50%-60% of the overall sex worker population does not have access to licensed and regulated establishments and find themselves pushed into illegal and potentially dangerous sectors of sex work.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt;

==Responses to migration and sex work==

===Government response===
National governments have responded to migrant sex work similarly to the way they have responded to mass migration.&lt;ref name=altman/&gt; Anti-immigration sentiments have flared in many receiving countries of mass migration, such as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schrag, Peter. 2010. ''Not Fit For Our Society''. University of California Press: Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; and various European countries, such as [[Immigration to France|France]].&lt;ref&gt;World Economic Forum. 2012. "What If Rich Countries Shut the Door on Immigration?" Time, September 20&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these negative sentiments are negative attitudes directed at migrants who engage in sex work, with concerns over sex work's relationship with transnational organized crime, sexually transmitted diseases, and lower moral standards.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; States have responded by tightening their borders and deporting migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=altman/&gt;

State response may differ based on anti-human trafficking attitudes that often prevail. Some states are sympathetic to migrant sex workers who are considered to be victims of human trafficking and not voluntary sex workers. Some governments, such as that of the United States, provide legal and health services to individuals who engage in commercial sex if these individuals are proven and officially certified by law enforcement to be victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Kirk. 2012. "Young Immigrants, Seeking Deferred Action Help, Find Unexpected Path." New York Times, March 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze statue ''Belle'' by Els Rijerse in [[De Wallen]], the largest and best known [[red-light district]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Inscription says "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]

===NGO response===
Response from [[non-governmental organizations]] have largely been centered on anti-trafficking activism and service provision that may also include migrant sex workers. Much of NGO response to migrant sex work has been on increasing awareness of human trafficking problems. Anti-trafficking NGOs have played a role in providing health services and contraceptives.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; Sex worker outreach organizations also exist in the areas of public and global health.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; NGOs also largely target migrant sex workers for their high risk of attracting and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. They offer services such as providing contraception in the form of condoms, engaging sex workers in educational classes concerning sexual and other forms of physical health, and providing HIV and other STD testing.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt;

In some contexts, such as the United States, NGOs have played a role in [[t visa|facilitating illegal migrant access to legal status]] and eventually permanent residency or citizenship. However, these legal benefits are often only available for individuals who can prove their involvement in commercial sex work was involuntary and a form of human trafficking victimhood. On the other hand, some NGO-run campaigns encourage migrant sex workers to return to their nations of origin.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt;

The existence of anti-human trafficking NGOs has also been spurred by the United States [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]]' Trafficking In Persons Report.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; A prominent component of the TIP Report ranking of countries's response to human trafficking is their involvement and encouragement of civil society and non-governmental efforts at combating human trafficking.&lt;ref name=TIP/&gt;

====Open Society Foundation-funded sexual exploitation advocates====
{{See also|Sex workers' rights}}

There have also been organizations that explicitly support the existence and rights of migrant sex workers,&lt;ref name=doezema/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kempadoo, Kamala. 1998. "Globalizing Sex Workers' Rights." ''Canadian Woman Studies'' 22:143-150.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are sex worker activist groups themselves. These groups primarily argue for the [[Sex workers' rights|recognition of sex work as a legitimate form of work]] or for the rights and legal status of migrant workers to exist.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; Many of these NGOs argue for more open border and security policies that would not harm migrant sex workers and the risks that accompany illegal status. Such groups include the [http://www.nswp.org/ New Sex Worker Project], [http://www.iusw.org/ International Union of Sex Workers], and [http://www.sexworkeurope.org/ The International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe].

===United States influence on responses to migrant sex work===

====Trafficking in Persons Report====
{{See also|Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons}}

The United States Department of State exerts significant influence on the migration and human trafficking policies of foreign government through the [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]]. The [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] releases an annual Trafficking In Persons Report that rates all countries based on their response and action regarding human trafficking within and between their borders.&lt;ref name=TIP&gt;Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. 2012. "Trafficking in Persons Report." U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ratings are based on whether or not a government is deemed compliant with U.S. minimum standards for response to human trafficking, which are articulated in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. According to the U.S. Department of State, countries are rated on the following standards&lt;ref name="tip report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2012/192363.htm|title=Tier Placements|work=state.gov|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Tier 1''' Countries whose governments fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act’s (TVPA) minimum standards.
* '''Tier 2''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the TVPA’s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.
* '''Tier 2 Watchlist''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the TVPA’s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards
* '''Tier 3''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. A Tier 3 ranking can result in significant sanctions from the U.S. government, such as opposition to assistance from international financial assistance institutions and the withdrawal of non-humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2011/164221.htm|title=Tiers: Placement, Guide, and Penalties for Tier 3 Countries|work=state.gov|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the [[U.S. Department of State]] understanding and discussion of human trafficking involves the international flow of migration. According to the Department of State, "Although not all trafficking involves migration, and not all migration is human trafficking, the vulnerabilities of migrants make them a tempting target for traffickers."&lt;ref name="tip report"/&gt; Countries' responses towards migrant workers' conditions of vulnerability therefore play a pivotal role in their Trafficking in Persons Report ranking.

National governments respond to Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watchlist rankings and the potential consequence of sanctions in a variety of ways. These responses also differ in their effects on migrant sex workers. Many countries respond by placing more restrictive immigration standards or greater migration regulations, all for the purpose of seemingly improving state response to human trafficking risks that may accompany open borders.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; However, the effects of these new regulations have been mixed when it comes to the actual well-being of migrant sex workers. For example, South Korea, after their Tier 3 ranking in the 2001 TIP, launched an in-depth national survey to examine the conditions of their foreign sex workers. At the head of this new effort, however, was a government minister who had previously sough to abolish prostitution. The result was a national law that outlawed the role of third-party migration intermediaries who played an important role in facilitating the migration process of women into South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, June JH. 2005. "Human Trafficking in East Asia: Current Trends, Data Collection, and Knowledge Gaps." Pp 165-202 in ''Data and research on human trafficking: A global survey'' edited by Laczko, Frank and Gozdziak, Elzbieta. Geneva: International Organization for Migration.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-Prostitution Pledge====
{{See also|Anti-prostitution pledge}}

In 2003, Congress under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] announced the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), a commitment of $15 billion over five years (2003–2008) from United States to internationally fight the [[HIV/AIDS]]. In an effort to combat human trafficking and the supposed role of sex trafficking in spreading HIV/AIDS, the legislation explicitly opposes any efforts that do not conflate prostitution and sex trafficking:&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* "No funds [...] may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds [...] may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

Within PEPFAR lies the controversial [[anti-prostitution pledge]], a pledge NGOs and governments, with few exceptions, must sign declaring their opposition to prostitution or service provision to prostitutes. This pledge has been heavily criticized by NGOs working to fight HIV/AIDS, sex worker rights activists and organizations, and even national governments who feel a declaration of opposition towards prostitution would be counterproductive to eliminating HIV/AIDS among a vulnerable population.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael M. 2005. "Brazil Refuses U.S. AIDS Funds, Rejects Conditions" in ''The Wall Street Journal'' May 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This pledge and its requirement of opposition to prostitution has affected the funding of many organizations working explicitly with migrant sex workers by eliminating many of their social services and increasing their risk of abuse and limited mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Busza, Joanna. 2006. "Having the rug pulled from under your feet: one project’s experience of the US policy reversal on sex work."''Health Policy Plan'' 21(4): 329-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===The Netherlands and Sweden===
[[File:Prostitution Info Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Prostitution Info Center in [[Amsterdam]] ]]

Countries within the European Union have varied legal statuses for prostitution and sex work. Two European nations have served as representative examples of the two popularly debated legal responses to prostitution: [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden's]] model of criminalizing the purchase of sex, but not the act of selling it; and the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands']] model of legalizing and regulating sex work.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Many pro-sex work advocates argue that the Dutch model of legalization and regulation is the most beneficial for the labor standards and working conditions of sex workers, while many anti-sex work and anti-sex trafficking activists argue that the Swedish Model helps eliminate unfair criminalization of prostitutes instead of the janes, johns and pimps who exploit them.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Criminalizing clients and pimps additionally avoids prosecuting prostitutes who are in reality victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

However, many scholars argue that neither of these models have had dramatically different results in the status of sex workers or trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="bernsteinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Rather, both models have only deepened the dangers of sex work for vulnerable groups that engage in sex work, primarily socioeconomically disadvantaged migrant workers.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt;&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; Criminalization of buyers of sex work has created more dangerous situations for individuals who continue to engage in commercial sex. Often, they can no longer conduct transactions in public spaces because their clients fear arrest and legal action. As a result, sex work is less susceptible to outreach, and migrants who fear legal repercussions themselves for their legal statuses are unwilling to be involved in situations that may involve law enforcement or service provision.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt;

Under the Dutch Model, these legal benefits and reduction of risk are not available to migrant sex workers who are largely illegal.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt; Regulated and legalized sex work requires the registration of brothels, mandated health testing for sex workers, and various other regulations for indoor working spaces and the procurement of clients. As a result, illegal migrant workers who fear deportment over their legal status cannot participate in the formal paperwork associated with legal sex work. They continue to become marginalized from more privileged sex workers.

===Dubai, United Arab Emirates===
{{See also|Prostitution in the United Arab Emirates}}

The [[United Arab Emirates]]'s geographic location makes it an important stepping stone for migrants from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Southeast Asia]] who wish to eventually work in Europe or the United States.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; The UAE's economic boom and aggressive development in the early to mid 2000s made it not only attractive to foreign migrants, but also dependent on them. In Dubai, migrants make up almost 90% of the population.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; While this migrant population is very diverse in terms of nation of origin, the population is divided into mainly two key demographics: poor, vulnerable laborers who come to Dubai through restrictive labor contacts; and rich, Western businessmen and financiers. Both populations contribute to Dubai and the greater UAE in very different yet very important ways. While the more privileged Western migrants contribute financial capital to the development of the city, the poor migrants contribute much of the physical labor necessary to build the city's physical structures.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt;

Along with demand for migrant laborers was also the demand for migrant sex workers. Because of the diversity in the demographics of individuals who live and work in [[Dubai]], a highly diverse and stratified commercial sex industry also exists to cater to these diversities in background, income, and class.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; For example, the spectrum of sex worker diversity ranges from migrants from Nigeria, Iran, Philippines, and Russia, with their skin tone corresponding to the price they command and the male clientele they see: the lighter the sex worker's skin color, the more Western the clientele and the higher the price. As a result, the UAE's migrant sex worker population is highly diverse and burgeoning. However, because the UAE is a Muslim country without legal prostitution, these sex workers remain largely underground, illegal, and in constant fear of law enforcement intervention and the possibility of deportation.

Because of the UAE's large migrant worker population, restrictive labor contracts, and lack of anti-trafficking partnerships with NGOs, the United States Department of State [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|Trafficking In Persons Report]] gave UAE a series of Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watchlist rankings.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; As a result, the UAE allowed more local and international NGO presence to develop, including those working to end human trafficking and sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt;

In March 2006 the [[Washington Monthly]] awarded ''Mine Safety and Health News'' its Monthly Journalism Award which is presented each month to "one or more newspaper, magazine, radio, or television stories (or series of stories) that demonstrate a commitment to the public interest ... particularly reporting that explains the successes and failures of government agencies at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ellen+Smith%3A+Mine+Safety+and+Health+News.-a0142574083|title=Ellen Smith: Mine Safety and Health News.|work=Washington Monthly|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its staff was awarded the Society of Professional Journalist [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in July 2007, for the coverage of the [[Sago Mine disaster|2006 Sago Mine Disaster]] in [[West Virginia]] that left 12 miners dead. "The judges lauded their coverage as informative and complete and in no way was led by the 'disaster pack' of national media covering the disaster. It provides its readers with insights and details not found in other coverage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=SDX Awards: Public Service in Newsletter Journalism|journal=Quill|date=July 2007|url=http://www.spj.org/quill_issue.asp?ref=1172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was again awarded the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in July 2008, for the coverage of the [[Crandall Canyon Mine|2007 Crandall Canyon Mine Disaster]] in [[Utah]] that ultimately left 9 people dead. The judges said they "provided much needed context ... including information about the mine owner's controversial history with safety violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Winner: Mine Safety &amp; Health News|journal=Quill|date=July 2008|url = http://www.spj.org/quill_issue.asp?ref=1365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was awarded the  Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Newsletter Journalism in 1989 when she was the editor of the former publication Mine Regulation Reporter, for coverage of the 1989 Pyro Mining Co. Williams Station Mine Disaster.

In 2008, an editorial entitled "High Negligence and Reckless Disregard," was given the Magnum Opus "Gold Award" for best signed editorial or essay. In it, Smith was highly critical of the Mine Safety and Health Administration allowing reporters and camera crews into the Crandall Canyon Mine just days after a disaster trapped two miners and the mine was unstable. Four days after her editorial was published, the mine experienced a huge coal burst that killed 6 rescuers. 

''Mine Safety and Health News'' has also received several APEX Awards for Publication Excellence (1996, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2015).

==Special Projects==
Worked with Global News - 16X9 program highlighting concerns in the Donkin Mine Project in Nova Scotia, where a company owned by U.S. coal operator Chris Cline seeks to mine metallurgical coal almost 2,000 feet under the Atlantic Ocean. Smith pointed to problems in Cline's mines in the U.S., specifically the MC#1 Mine that has continuous and recurring serious mining violations. Smith also questioned the "due diligence" in the report prepared for the Canadian government, which seems to gloss over some of the more serious problems with Cline's mine in the United States.  See: http://globalnews.ca/news/2654293/donkin-coal-mine-in-cape-breton-to-open-this-summer-amid-safety-concerns-from-critics/

Worked in partnership with National Public Radio finding hundreds of mine operators owing millions in delinquent mine safety penalties. While this was a story covered for years by Mine Safety and Health News, NPR's team was able to download massive data sets from the government to show that mines with delinquent MSHA penalties had accident rates 50% to 70% higher than mines who pay their fines.

'''Mock language''' is a term in [[linguistic anthropology]] for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's [[language ideology]] of the hegemonic language.

When talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term "[[Mock Spanish]]" was popularized in the 1990s by [[Jane H. Hill]], a linguist at the [[University of Arizona]], mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern [[United States]], where Hill first researched the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/|title=Mock Spanish: A Site For The Indexical Reproduction Of Racism In American English|last=Hill|first=Jane H.|date=|website=language-culture.binghamton.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Mock" has since been applied to other languages, and the [[umbrella term]] "Mock language" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.

== Definition ==
The speaker is unintentionally indexing a [[language ideology]] that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.

When using mock language, the speaker is showing their '[[cosmopolitanism]]' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This [[hegemony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3uxHCFOrEjwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Lull,+J.+(2000).+Media,+communication,+culture:+A+global+approach+(2nd+ed.).+New+York:+Columbia+University+Press&amp;ots=JARfcJrcB6&amp;sig=ejH_hZjCuDYZ_TAtfVqbdYYQpwc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media, Communication, Culture: A Global Approach|last=Lull|first=James|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231120739|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.

For the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken.  
 
== History, Theorists, and Contributors ==
The term "Mock Spanish" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as "Mock-Languages." Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media—such as television and social networking applications—during the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.

Hill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in [[New York City|New York]] uses their [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]]. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes [[Markedness|marked]] and "sharply objectified" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Jane|date=|title=Language, Race, and White Public Space|url=https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/682046?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100 (No. 3)|pages=680–689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how [[semantic domain]]s index a state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saying something is "el cheapo" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.

In a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. “...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobe|first=Tyanna|date=2018|title=Style, Stance, and Social Meaning in Mock White Girl|url=|journal=Language in Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.

Mock white girl shows how the intentional use of [[Vocal fry register|vocal fry]] to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.

Another semantic domain is language crossing. “Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampton|first=Ben|date=1995-12-01|title=Language crossing and the problematisation of ethnicity and socialisation|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|journal=Pragmatics. Quarterly Publication of the International Pragmatics Association (IPrA)|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=485–513|doi=10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|issn=1018-2101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.

== Implications of Study ==
Mock language is used in [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.

The study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. “It is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=June 2001|title=The Construction of White, Black, and Korean American Identities through African American Vernacular English|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|issn=1055-1360|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.

== Controversy ==
In the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2018/americans_strongly_favor_english_as_official_language|title=Americans Strongly Favor English as Official Language|last=|first=|date=2018-04-26|website=Rasmussen Reports|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as “American”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet “mock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vessey|first=Rachelle|date=2014|title=Borrowed words, mock language and nationalism in Canada|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|volume=14|issue=2|pages=176–190|doi=10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|issn=1470-8477|eissn=1747-759X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.

== Features of Mock Language ==
[[File:Namaste in bed.jpg|thumb|People usually wear this shirt to indicate that they are going to yoga or going to sleep to promote laziness and zen with the language Hindi.It creates a pun through code switching, but the Hindi word is not actually associated with yoga.]]
While not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered [[pronoun]]s of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.

Mock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical "white girl's" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features [[uptalk]], [[creaky voice]], blondness and the stereotypical association with [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not [[Code Switch|code switch]] between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know [[Hindi]] when using it in such a context. 
  
== Mock Spanish ==
It has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where "speaking" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say "el" or add an "o" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.

“Mock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually “loose,” and unintelligent Spanish speaker.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Gordon|first=Jennifer|date=2011-11-24|title=Discipline and Disorder in the Whiteness of Mock Spanish1|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=211–229|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|issn=1055-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- More needed. Can you outline all the rules that Hill noticed? --&gt; &lt;!-- Did you guys read Hill's "Mock Spanish: A site for the indexical reproduction of racism in American English"? Here she gives all of the features and she explains the use of Mock Spanish in terms of creating "semantic domains." As long as you cite it properly, you can include all of her findings. --&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Danke Sign.jpg|thumb|Danke Sign: This sign shows the business's affiliation to Germany. While trying to teach the English speaking viewers a German word, it does not provide any pronunciation guides or context.|227x227px]]Popular T-shirts for young women with the saying "[[namaste]] in bed". This borrows the traditional greeting from [[Hindi]] and makes it into a pun of the slang term "imma stay in bed". It also associates the Hindi word as a [[yoga]] term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.

[[Cinco de Mayo]], a holiday that celebrates Mexico’s defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term “[[Cinco de Drinko]]” has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday’s history and an example of the “add ‘o’” phenomenon. The “add ‘o’” phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an “o” to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.

YouTuber “[[Louise Pentland|Sprinkle of Glitter]]” would open videos until 2017 saying “Aloha Sprinklerinos”. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ec_geALd1A&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mock White Girl" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film ''[[Mean Girls]],'' character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOmTMCtGkI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mock german.jpg|thumb|'Das Boot' mocks the German language for English speaking marketing purposes as "boot" does not translate into a type of footwear but to 'boat' in English. This shows the semantic domain which associates anything German with a drinking culture.]]
Bars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for "thank you", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.

The signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but "das boot" in German translates as “the boat” and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.

'''The Mycetoma Research Center''' was established in 1991 under the umbrella of the University of Khartoum. It was set up at Soba University Hospital to provide medical care for [[Mycetoma]] patients, research and education and teaching in the various aspects of Mycetoma.

Mycetoma is a common health problem, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions and reported throughout the globe.

'''The Staff'''

The staff members are of medical, health and science backgrounds; they are interested in all facets related to Mycetoma and have good track records in patients’ management, teaching, research and community development. Through clinical and basic research, the staff of the center has continually explored new approaches to patients’ management.

'''Research Programmes'''

The research programmes and projects carried out in the Center are of a multidisciplinary approach focusing on basic research into the causes and progression of Mycetoma, the translation of new knowledge and technology into novel treatments and the provision of patient care.

The '''Norwegian Institute for Social Research''' ({{lang-no|Institutt for samfunnsforskning}}, IFS) is a private [[social science]] [[research institute]] based in [[Oslo]], Norway.

It was founded in 1950 by [[Vilhelm Aubert]], [[Arne Næss]], [[Eirik Rinde]], and [[Stein Rokkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038| title = History of the ISF| accessdate = 28 April 2007| last = Beer| first = Nicolai| date = | work = Institute for Social Research (official site)| publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070803230017/http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes the journal ''[[Tidsskrift for samfunnsforskning]]''.

The institute is divided into five research fields, each with its own research director. They are [[Bernt Aardal]] (Political institutions, voting and public opinion), [[Erling Barth]] (Employment and working conditions), Mari Teigen (Gender and society), Bernard Enjolras (Civil society in transition) and Hilde Lidén (International migration, integration and ethnic relations). In total, the institute has 52 employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2943">'''Objective abstraction''' was a British art movement c. 1933-1936.

==History==
Objective abstraction was a form of abstract art developed by a group of British artists in 1933. Experimentation was prevalent in [[British art]] at the time.

The main figures were [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]], [[William Coldstream]], [[Edgar Hubert]], [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] and [[Geoffrey Tibble]].

The movement was short-lived lasting only a few years. Many of the artists involved went on to be part of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[Euston Road School]].

==Method==
William Townsend told the [[Tate Gallery]] that 'the style originated with [[Geoffrey Tibble]] in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] [...] and at the same time or shortly after by [[Edgar Hubert]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hubert-painting-t06602/text-catalogue-entry|title=Stephens, Chris (1997) Edgar Hubert, Painting 1935-6: Catalogue entry, Tate website|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27TOWNSEND%27&amp;dsqDb=Catalog|title=William Townsend papers, University College London archive |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.

The more abstract paintings, that came to represent the movements style, were created using improvised freely applied brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/objective-abstraction|title=Objective Abstraction, Tate website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/moynihan-objective-abstraction-t00172|title=Rodrigo Moynihan, artwork 'Objective Abstraction' c.1935–6, Tate Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Tibble]] described them as 'not abstracted from nature, and which made no reference to and had no associations with anything outside themselves [...] the picture was an object in its own right' (Bowness, 1960:198).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/873008?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104397110851|title=Bowness, Alan (1960) The Paintings and Constructions of Victor Pasmore, ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 102, no. 168, May, pp. 198-203|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1934, the exhibition ''Objective Abstractions'' was held at the [[Zwemmer Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/zwemmer-gallery|title=Zwemmer Gallery, Artist Biographies website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition also included work by more representational artists, [[Ivon Hitchens]], [[Victor Pasmore]], and [[Ceri Richards]].

'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]].  A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma.

Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. 

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2.&lt;ref&gt;RICHARD FLORIDA. (2016, April 14). Big Cities Are the Future of Global Consumption. Retrieved November 5, 2017, from https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/04/big-cities-are-the-future-of-global-consumption/478128/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green party|Green parties]] and the [[ecology movement]] often argue that consumption per person, or [[ecological footprint]], is typically lower in poor than in rich nations.

==Causes==
In understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. &lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market.

Two main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt; This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. 
As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. &lt;ref&gt;The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

==Effects==
{{See also|I PAT}}
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]].

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. &lt;ref&gt;Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
&lt;/ref&gt;

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. &lt;ref&gt;Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer-waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study
&lt;/ref&gt;


The scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an [[overclass]] to exist, displaying  [[affluenza]] and [[obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nierenberg|first1=Danielle|title=State of the World 2006: a Worldwatch Institute report on progress toward a sustainable society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/state-of-the-world-2006-a-worldwatch-institute-report-on-progress-toward-a-sustainable-society/oclc/62865904|website=Worldcat|publisher=New York; London: W.W. Norton|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpopulation and overconsumption|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/306/6888/1285|website=BMJ|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|title=World needs to stabilise population and cut consumption, says Royal Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/EnvIssues/Population/Result.asp Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved on 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst case a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. [[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption.  Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lester R. |title=World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse |publisher=Norton |series=Earth Policy Institute |year=2011 |page=7 |isbn =113654075X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Renner|first=Michael|title=State of the world 2005: A Worldwatch Institute Report on progress toward a sustainable society.|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3866|accessdate=2009-09-14|date=January 2006|publisher=[[W.W. Norton]]|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32666-7|oclc=57470324|chapter=Chapter 1: China, India, and the New World Order|chapterurl=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] 2005 report said the two countries' high [[economic growth]] exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Footprint==
{{main article|Ecological footprint}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.|source=—[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], biologist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.”  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" /&gt;  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A. Hobson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money |page=366 |quote=Mr. Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.
* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J. (2008). [https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/08/09/Bordo.pdf Monetary Economic Research at the St. Louis Fed During Ted Balbach's Tenure as Research Director]. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Possibility theory''' is a mathematical theory for dealing with certain types of [[uncertainty]] and is an alternative to [[probability theory]]. Professor [[Lotfi Zadeh]] first introduced possibility theory in 1978 as an extension of his theory of [[fuzzy sets]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. [[Didier Dubois (mathematician)|Didier Dubois]] and Henri Prade further contributed to its development. Earlier in the 1950s, economist [[G. L. S. Shackle]] proposed the [[min/max algebra]] to describe degrees of potential surprise.

==Formalization of possibility==
For simplicity, assume that the [[universe of discourse]] Ω is a finite set. A possibility measure is a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that:

:Axiom 1: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:Axiom 2: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(\Omega) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:Axiom 3: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cup V) = \max \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right)&lt;/math&gt; for any disjoint subsets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that, like probability, the possibility measure is determined by its behavior on singletons:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = \max_{\omega \in U} \operatorname{pos}(\{\omega\})&lt;/math&gt;

provided that ''U'' is finite or countably infinite.

Axiom 1 can be interpreted as the assumption that Ω is an exhaustive description of future states of the world, because it means that no belief weight is given to elements outside Ω.

Axiom 2 could be interpreted as the assumption that the evidence from which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}&lt;/math&gt; was constructed is free of any contradiction. Technically, it implies that there is at least one element in Ω with possibility 1.

Axiom 3 corresponds to the additivity axiom in probabilities. However there is an important practical difference. Possibility theory is computationally more convenient because Axioms 1–3 imply that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cup V) = \max \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right)&lt;/math&gt; for ''any'' subsets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

Because one can know the possibility of the union from the possibility of each component, it can be said that possibility is [[Principle of compositionality|''compositional'']] with respect to the union operator. Note however that it is not compositional with respect to the intersection operator. Generally:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cap V) \leq \min \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

When Ω is not finite, Axiom 3 can be replaced by:

:For all index sets &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, if the subsets &lt;math&gt;U_{i,\, i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}\left(\cup_{i \in I} U_i\right) = \sup_{i \in I}\operatorname{pos}(U_i).&lt;/math&gt;

==Necessity==

Whereas [[probability theory]] uses a single number, the probability, to describe how likely an event is to occur, possibility theory uses two concepts, the ''possibility'' and the ''necessity ''of the event. For any set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the necessity measure is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1 - \operatorname{pos}(\overline U)&lt;/math&gt;

In the above formula, &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complement of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, that is the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that do not belong to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to show that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) \leq \operatorname{pos}(U)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;

and that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U \cap V) = \min ( \operatorname{nec}(U), \operatorname{nec}(V))&lt;/math&gt;

Note that contrary to probability theory, possibility is not self-dual. That is, for any event &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, we only have the inequality:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) + \operatorname{pos}(\overline U) \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;

However, the following duality rule holds:

:For any event &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, beliefs about an event can be represented by a number and a bit.

==Interpretation==
There are four cases that can be interpreted as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is necessary. &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is certainly true. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is impossible. &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is certainly false. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is possible. I would not be surprised at all if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; occurs. It leaves &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U)&lt;/math&gt; unconstrained.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is unnecessary. I would not be surprised at all if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; does not occur. It leaves &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U)&lt;/math&gt; unconstrained.

The intersection of the last two cases is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that I believe nothing at all about &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Because it allows for indeterminacy like this, possibility theory relates to the graduation of a many-valued logic, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], rather than the classical two-valued logic.

Note that unlike possibility, fuzzy logic is compositional with respect to both the union and the intersection operator. The relationship with fuzzy theory can be explained with the following classical example.

* Fuzzy logic: When a bottle is half full, it can be said that the level of truth of the proposition "The bottle is full" is 0.5. The word "full" is seen as a fuzzy predicate describing the amount of liquid in the bottle.
* Possibility theory: There is one bottle, either completely full or totally empty. The proposition "the possibility level that the bottle is full is 0.5" describes a degree of belief. One way to interpret 0.5 in that proposition is to define its meaning as: I am ready to bet that it's empty as long as the odds are even (1:1) or better, and I would not bet at any rate that it's full.

==Possibility theory as an imprecise probability theory==
There is an extensive formal correspondence between probability and possibility theories, where the addition operator corresponds to the maximum operator.

A possibility measure can be seen as a consonant [[plausibility measure]] in [[Dempster–Shafer theory]] of evidence. The operators of possibility theory can be seen as a hyper-cautious version of the operators of the [[transferable belief model]], a modern development of the theory of evidence.

Possibility can be seen as an [[upper and lower probabilities|upper probability]]: any possibility distribution defines a unique set of admissible probability distributions by

::&lt;math&gt;\left\{\, p: \forall S\ p(S)\leq \operatorname{pos}(S)\,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows one to study possibility theory using the tools of [[imprecise probability|imprecise probabilities]].

==Necessity logic==
We call ''generalized possibility'' every function satisfying Axiom 1 and Axiom 3. We call ''generalized necessity'' the dual of a generalized possibility. The generalized necessities are related with a very simple and interesting fuzzy logic we call ''necessity logic''. In the deduction apparatus of necessity logic the logical axioms are the usual classical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. Also, there is only a fuzzy inference rule extending the usual Modus Ponens. Such a rule says that if α and α → β are proved at degree λ and μ, respectively, then we can assert β at degree min{λ,μ}. It is easy to see that the theories of such a logic are the generalized necessities and that the completely consistent theories coincide with the necessities (see for example Gerla 2001).

'''Prodesis''' was a development project in the [[Lacandon region]] of [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], that ran from 2004 to 2008.&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Mexico+Chiapas+Prodesis.jpg|thumb|right]] --&gt;
The aim of the project was to reduce pressure on the rainforest and combat poverty among its inhabitants, most of them being [[Maya peoples|Mayan Indians]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence peasants]].

== Plan and objectives ==

'''Prodesis''' is an abbreviation of the Spanish name for the programme:&lt;br /&gt;
''Proyecto de Desarrollo Social Integrado y Sostenible, Chiapas, Mexico''&lt;br /&gt;
(''Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project, Chiapas, Mexico'').

Its overall objectives were:[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx/?Plan_Global_y_Planes_Operativos_Anuales]
# [[poverty reduction]] among the inhabitants of the [[Lacandon region]]
# reduction of the pressure on the [[natural resources]] and mitigation of [[environmental degradation]]
# reformulation of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|social development policies in Chiapas]], with emphasis on [[Participatory democracy|participative]] and [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] territorial development

These goals should stimulate a sense of [[citizenship]], and enhance the relation between the [[Chiapas]] government and the 155,000 inhabitants of the 830 communities located around the protected area of the [[Lacandon Jungle]]: the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]]. This population, which is mainly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|rural]], has the highest levels of [[poverty]] and [[marginalization]] in the State of Chiapas, and of [[Mexico]] as a whole.

''Prodesis'' was a continuation the ''Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Selva Lacandon Forest'' ([[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]]), which in turn was a continuation of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|Plan Cañadas]].

As re-formulated on start-up in 2003, ''Prodesis'' focussed on 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by  [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]]. These "micro-regions" were defined by suitability for particular approaches to social and economic development and included Agua Azul, Avellanal, Amador Hernández, Betania, Benemerito de las Américas, Carmen Villaflores, Comunidad Lacandona, Damasco, Francisco I Madero, Maravilla Tenejapa, Marqués de Comillas, Nahá, Nuevo Francisco León, Nuevo Huixtán, Rio Blanco, and Santo Domingo.

== Financing, organization, implementation and evaluation ==
The project was a cooperation between the state of [[Chiapas]] and the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]), and was budgeted for €31.000.000, of which €16.000.000 was invested by the state of Chiapas. The [[European Union|EU]] contributed €15.000.000 through [[EuropeAid]]. The European project (or agreement) code is ALA/B7-310/2003/5756.

The history of PRODESIS stretches back to 1996 when a mission of 4 consultants visited Mexico and carried out an area appraisal to prepare a proposal for a Euro 5 million project to be carried out between SEMARNAP and the EC (Teyssier, Capietto and de Agostini, 1996). In late 1998 SEMARNAP responded to a set of key issues that had been raised by the EC Delegation in 1997, presented a reformulated proposal and requested that renewed consideration be given to the Project.
 
The 1996 proposal was appraised by a further mission, carried out in September 1999, made up of Dr. Alastair White (anthropologist and socioeconomist) and Torsten Mark Kowal (rural development forester and climate/environmental scientist), working for LTS Consultants, Scotland, UK. They reported on the ongoing feasibility of the Project as designed in 1996 through: (i) fact-finding to identify substantive changes in the socio-economic and political context; (ii) analysis of the logic and applicability of the original approach; (iii) appraisal of the probability of fulfilment of basic conditions, identified in 1996 as prerequisites for successful project implementation. The re-designed project was proposed to EU Aide Attaches in Sept 1999 and to EuropeAid in Brussels. The main points in the re-design were to require local project-orientated planning processes within all components to supersede the ambitious participatory planning component proposed in 1996; and emphasis was placed on defining options for achievable changes in land-use, for training specific groups in the alternative land use and microenterprises options, and for linking up community-level projects with credit and other funding sources. 

From 2000 to 2003 the project then awaited improvements in the social and political context, as well as due process by the EC and the Mexican Government. The go-ahead for Prodesis was agreed in 2001. Preparations and consultations started in 2002, and the final contract was signed December 2003. 

Following formal approval, given all the elapsed time, it was necessary to re-design the project yet again, and this was done by Dieter Paas and Arturo Arreola, once the project was tendered for European Technical Assistance in 2003.[http://www.prodesis.chiapas.gob.mx] However, it is unclear how far the White/Kowal recommendations were accepted; nor is it evident how many of the changes proposed in 1999 to the 1996 proposal were then taken on board during the 2003 re-design once the project formally started up. No internet references exist that describe these inputs and their role. 

The project started in 2004 and initially was expected to run until 2007, but due to delays related to modifications of the project plan and financial issues between the EU and Mexico, the project then continued for an extra year until September 2008.

Prodesis was carried out by SeDeSol (Secretariat of Social Development of the State of Chiapas), and its director was Rodolfo Diaz Sarvide.&lt;br /&gt;
Christian Bouteille was the (European) head of the International Technical Assistance. The European Delegation in Mexico-City [http://www.delmex.ec.europa.eu/] was responsible for the European involvement in the project.

Despite some progress and the benefits resulting from the Prodesis investment,in 2008 a classified evaluation report, ordered by the European Commission, and conducted by IBF International Consulting in collaboration with B.A.a Consultors (Piero Di Giacinto, Jan Karremans, Thomas Pijnenburg) concluded that Prodesis had not achieved all its objectives. 

These strong criticisms were summarised by independent sources and can be read here [http://www.expresionlibre.org/site2/estados/noti_0642.php] or here [http://eljustoreclamo.blogspot.com/2008/01/chiapas-operacin-fracaso-comunidades.html]. A further clear set of criticisms are summarised here [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230208/http://www.rmalc.org.mx/documentos/libros/libro%20EU-boell.pdf] that take Prodesis as a case study.

On the 13th and 14 October 2008 the 8th meeting of the Joint Committee (established Under the EU-Mexico Economic Partnership) Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement (Global Agreement) was held in Mexico City. Regarding the session on cooperation it was stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Both parties took note of the progress achieved in current projects in the fields of social development, economic cooperation and science and technology. The parties furthermore underlined the positive results of PRODESIS implementation and agreed to explore the possibility of continuing it with a second phase in the 2007-2013 Cooperation Programme."[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st14/st14478.en08.pdf]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early 2009 it was decided that Prodesis was not going to be continued with a second phase in the Cooperation Programme.

== Historical background of European involvement ==

Prodesis was signed within the framework of the [[Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Association Agreement]] between the [[European Union]] and [[Mexico]]:[https://web.archive.org/web/20090309205444/http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/mexico/index_en.htm]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The new agreement should lead to liberalization of trade and investment between Mexico and the EU [...but also to...] greater social equality and a political system that is genuinely democratic and pluralist and respects human rights. [...] This agreement opens the door to a wide range of potential cooperation activities between the parties, and will allow '''the EU to provide Mexico with financial and technical assistance for such social programmes as action against poverty, regional development, and cooperation in the field of human rights and protection of indigenous communities'''. [...] With regard to the current political context in Mexico, the discussions on the new agreement are going hand-in-hand in Mexico with a complex internal political process of democratization and reform. [...] '''The process of reform currently underway is also being hindered by a range of other factors such as [...] the [[Chiapas conflict|conflict in Chiapas]], the activities of [[EZLN|guerilla movements]] in a number of other areas and the human rights situation, one of the most dramatic recent examples being the massacre which occurred in [[Acteal massacre|Acteal]] on 22 December 1997 and which was strongly condemned by Parliament in its resolution of 15 January 1998.''' [...] The 1997 agreements [...] include a '''democracy clause''' or '''human rights clause''' as an essential component. This was a stumbling block to the signing of the framework agreement in 1991. Nevertheless, the difficulties which have arisen in the context of the transition process in Mexico have highlighted the importance of the ''democracy clause''. [...] Parliament therefore considered it vital that the ''democracy clause'' be included in the new agreement and that the applicability of the agreement would be conditional on strict respect for that clause."[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A4-1998-0156+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism of Prodesis ==
On January 23, 2004 an article in the Mexican newspaper ''La Jornada''[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2004/01/24/010n3pol.php?printver=1&amp;fly=1] reported that in the community of Nuevo San Rafael in the Lacandon forest, 23 houses were burned down and that the victims were chased into the jungle. February 3 Mexican news magazine Proceso suggested a link with a cooperation programme between Mexico and the EU.[http://www.proceso.com.mx/noticias_articulo.php?articulo=21506] On several Indymedia-sites [http://www.indymedia.org/it/2004/01/110358.shtml] and other news and community sites around the world it was soon suggested that the violence was perpetrated by the [[Mexican Army]] against the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] tribe, and that the [[European Union|EU]] was involved in relation to [[Plan Puebla Panamá]]. Before the project even got started Prodesis was already accused of being a [[counter-insurgency]] project aimed at getting rid of the local population to gain control over the regions' [[natural resources]].

Based on this information Member of the [[European Parliament]] Erik Meijer posed a question (E-0546/04, 26-2-2004) to the [[European Commission]] ([[Prodesis#Questions about Prodesis in the European Parliament|see below]]).

Since early 2004 numerous critical articles (varying in factuality) about Prodesis have been published in Mexican newspapers (mainly [[La Jornada]]), magazines (Proceso [http://www.proceso.com.mx/busqueda.php?fuente=h&amp;b=chiapas%20operaci%F3n%20fracaso], Contralínea [http://www.contralinea.com.mx/]), and on websites of local and international [[NGO]]'s.

On the 9th of February 2007 58 representants of communities in the [[Lacandon region]] signed the [[Declaration of Moxviquil]] in which they demanded the project to be suspended. The most important reasons stated in the document were that they were not properly informed about the project, which is a violation of [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169] and the [[Mexican Constitution#Article 2|Mexican Constitution (art.2)]]. Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens and crops. After they had offered the declaration to the director of Prodesis and the head of the European Delegation in Mexico-City, some of those who signed the declaration were threatened by Prodesis staff: if they would stand by their signature, they would not receive any kind of government support anymore (like ''opportunidades'' or ''procampo'').

== Historical background and previous development projects ==

Also please see more about the socio-political context in the [[Lacandon region]], and the predecessor-projects of Prodesis, '''[[Chiapas conflict]]'''.

Until the 1950s, the Selva Lacandona covered an area of about 1.3 million hectares (13,000 km2). By the mid-1990s the pristine forest had been reduced to about 400,000 or at most 450,000 ha. The Lacandón Indians, who until the 1950s were the still the only inhabitants of the Selva Lacandona, were then only about 600 persons, having been reduced from much larger numbers by the diseases brought in the late nineteenth century to which they had no immunity, brought by the mahogany cutters who first penetrated the area. The Lacandones by late last century numbered about 800. Due to demographic pressure, since the late 1950s and especially in the 1970s, about 80,000 other Indians originating in the highlands of Chiapas have occupied parts of the forest area. They are mainly [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] (56% of the present population), with some Tojolabales (17%), Chols (11%) and Tzotzils (2%). 

The small Maya Lacandón communities were outside the monetary economy until recent decades and their main monetary income today comes from the sale of craft items. In 1972, as part of a state government manoeuvre in relation to timber extraction, the Lacandones were granted formal ownership of the 614,000 hectares of the ‘Bienes Comunales Lacandones’ then established, but in 1978 were obliged to share this with some 15,000 Tzeltal and Chol settlers then granted communal rights.  The majority of Lacandones do not possess cattle so have little negative impact on the forest, whereas in all the other communities, a better-off part of the population owns some beef-cattle, constituting an important form of saving and investment. Cattle are managed extensively, each head requiring about a hectare of land, and forest areas are frequently converted to pasture.
 
Marqués de Comillas, previously part of the Selva Lacandona forest, began to be settled by the same Indian groups in the 1970s. Then it was colonised in 1974-86 by settlers coming largely from other Mexican states, though the ejidos that were then formed absorbed the already-settled Tzeltal and other Chiapas Indian groups. Some 10-15% of the total population of the Selva Lacandona area are now mestizos (non-Indians) concentrated in Marqués de Comillas. At the time of settlement, the only communications were by river and by air, and some of the settlers left in the early years finding themselves unsuited to the pioneer life. As a result of the early unattractiveness of the area, the generation of settlers was able to obtain larger areas of land than the 20 hectares usually available to ejidatarios (heads of family on land distributed under the Mexican agrarian reform laws) elsewhere, with 50 hectares a common allocation. However, the interior of the Marqués de Comillas triangle remains poorly served by roads, and this has affected the growth of the communities where substantial concentrations of poverty are still found. 

Between about 1958 and 1986, both the Chiapas State and Federal governments either actively or passively favoured migration to “undeveloped” forest-land. The Chiapas state government looked favourably upon the migration of Indians to the Selva Lacandona, as it tended to reduce the pressure on land and particularly the demands for land reforms in parts of Chiapas where a latifundio system predominated. In the early 1960s and in 1974-86 two periods of federal government-sponsored colonisation occurred, the latter focused on Marqués de Comillas. This was a question of relieving pressures on the land elsewhere in the country.

Until 1986, government policy was by no means clearly oriented to protecting the forest. State-led exploitation of the forest’s precious woods was managed by COFOLASA/CORFO during the 1970s and 80s (cedar and particularly mahogany), as against private companies with largely North American capital who first entered the region in the 1850s. Valuable timber was extracted in this period from areas within the areas formally owned by the Comunidad Lacandona, as well as from Marqués de Comillas, as COFOLASA/CORFO was most active during the period of maximum conversion of forest for agriculture as colonisation proceeded.

Between the mid-1970s and 1986 agricultural and forestry policies continued to be inconsistent. Government statements and actions included both support for maintaining the forest (e.g. the proclamation of the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules in 1978); and support for activities which would have the opposite effect (e.g. legalisation of landholdings on the western side of the forest, and the opening-up of Marqués de Comillas with credit support for cattle, as well as state-sponsored oil exploration). Efforts to promote sustainable timber production in Marqués de Comillas began in 1987 and, after a Chiapas State ban on timber extraction from 1990 to 1994, restarted in 1995.

Since 1987 there has been an overall consistent policy of discouraging, if not preventing new settlement. The negotiated departure has been sought of those settled within the Biosphere Reserve post-1978 without land-rights. 

Government policy, as executed by a variety of state and federal authorities since the early 90s, has broadly sought to encourage a shift to sustainable agriculture so as not to make further inroads into the forest, but without great success due to weaknesses in conception and implementation - including the lack of participatory agricultural extension as proposed should be the methods used by PRODESIS. 

During the mid-1990s, SEMARNAP had established environmentally-orientated subsidies for maize cultivation (termed ‘milpa sedentarizada’), to prevent the burning of cut-over forest or reclaimed fallow, and to stop annual burns of weeds and crop residues. However,  the quota of families to receive these subsidies in each community is usually limited and the money typically arrives very late, which greatly reduces the incentive effect. Subsidies in money and kind are also given for other crops (coffee, organic vegetables, and saplings for timber plantations), but are subject to the same limitations. Inputs have also been given for minor animal husbandry projects. Numerous small economic projects for particular communities have been implemented with a low success rate, as little participatory planning was practised, and there has been little training of community members in the management of such projects.

State intervention patterns have created a situation in which government funds have become an important potential source of direct income, and this has affected local attitudes and behaviour. Communities wait and call for government schemes before taking action and can become disinclined to take local initiatives. A ‘dependency syndrome’ has developed that is often pronounced among the poorer communities, for which the government funds assume greater significance relative to their earnings from production. At least in some communities (Nueva Palestina) the incipient differentiation and the availability of government funds has led to tensions within the community: as to whether funds should go the better-off to further their entrepreneurial activities, or be reserved for the more disadvantaged sections of the community.

== Criticism of Prodesis and European involvement in the historical context ==

Despite the considerable development and biodiversity justifications for setting-up Prodesis, like its predecessor-projects [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|PIDSS]] and [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|Plan Cañadas]], was perceived by (a part of) the population and [[NGO]]'s (local as well as international) as a [[counter-insurgency]] "light" project. 

Something that sustained this scepticism was the fact that Prodesis focussed extensively on the demographic aspects of ''"[[The Chiapas Problem]]"'', and hardly referred to the socio-political history of the area where Prodesis was implemented. By blaming the [[Chiapas conflict]] on overpopulation in a vulnerable environment, but avoiding political issues connecting to the [[EZLN]], the [[San Andrés Accords]], and the diluted [[Cocopa law]] of 2001, many felt these core issues were not being taken seriously by the EC intervention. 

In particular, Prodesis has found it hard to deal with: (i) the delicate issue of "illegal" settlements within the nucleus of the Reserve; (ii) the considerable tensions between ethnic groups; and (iii) the extremely polarized political allegiances that are found in the area. Ensuring  participation in project design and management of the Lacandon people, other indigenous groups, and their organisations, was especially difficult.   

Criticism on Prodesis in relation to [[counter-insurgency]] or [[low intensity conflict]] can be broadly divided along 3 dimensions:

1] in relation to the history of [[marginalization]] of [[Maya peoples#Chiapas|indigenous people]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|landless peasants]] in Chiapas

2] in relation to the history of [[Chiapas conflict#Social development policies|social development policy in Chiapas]]

3] in relation to [[globalization]], [[Plan Puebla Panama]] and the European involvement in Prodesis

Many do believe that, under the guise of a development project (aimed at poverty reduction and protecting the environment), Europe's real motive to cooperate in Prodesis would be to secure European trade and investment in Mexico. Since social or political instability (or perceived instability) would pose a threat to the economic partnership, the EU would contribute to a [[counter-insurgency]] project. 

This would contradict Prodesis' emphasis on [[Grassroots democracy|participative democracy]]. (for a similar argument see also [[Riordan Roett|the Zapatista memo]]). Hence the allegations of a new [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquista]] by means of [[neo-liberal]] policies and [[Foreign direct investment|direct foreign investment]]. Communications from the EU itself have encouraged these ideas. Some quotes:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"The Commission wants to create a climate favourable to trade and investment. [...] It is in the EU’s interest to develop and consolidate its market positions and to pursue a dynamic investment policy. [...] The current challenge is to find a way to facilitate trade and European investment in Latin America. The Commission’s aim is to encourage the development of a legal climate to attract European investments and guarantee the predictability and security of these investments In the WTO framework […] contributing to the development of a stable and predictable framework to help the Latin American countries attract more European investment." [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005SC1590:EN:HTML Strategy for a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America]

"There are destabilising factors that could ultimately jeopardize growth and European investments, and thereby affect the biregional partnership. [...] They jeopardise growth and economic development. [...] These relate, in particular to the '''Chiapas problem''' and the integration of the marginalized population groups and the country’s '''indigenous communities''' in general. These potential '''instability factors''' bring with them a cost (lack of security for companies, a distorted image abroad, especially in Europe) and may '''represent important barriers to''' the general development of the country, and in particular to '''attracting European trade and investment'''."

== Questions about Prodesis in the European Parliament ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tzixcao1.jpg|thumb|right|click to enlarge]] --&gt;
26-2-2004: MEP '''[[Erik Meijer (politician)|Erik Meijer]], question E-0546/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Is the Commission aware that, according to the Mexican newspaper La Jornada of 3 February 2004, five non-governmental organisations in the south-eastern state of Chiapas consider the European Union to have been involved in an attack on the village of Nuevo San Rafael, controlled by the Zapatista movement and occupied by members of the Chol tribe, in the remote nature reserve of Montes Azules, which consists of primeval forest, on 19 or 22 January, in which attack 23 houses were set on fire, the occupants fled, the village was permanently cut off from the outside world by soldiers and the land is being returned to the former big land-owners to enable them to fell the primeval forest? [...] Was this attack encouraged by the fact that the EU has concluded an agreement concerning a development project worth € 15.000.000 with governor Pablo Salazar, possibly in part in connection with Plan Puebla Panama, which comprises major infrastructure projects in Central America from Panama to nine poor federal states in Mexico, which require the indigenous Indian population to make way for newcomers and to enable the land to be put to new uses or at least compel that population to give up the autonomy which it in practice enjoys?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

30-3-2004: Commissioner '''[[Chris Patten#European Commissioner|Chris Patten]], answer E-0546/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Mexico states in its first article that the: Respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, underpins the domestic and external policies of both Parties and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement. The Commission at all times ensures that its actions are consistent with this article. The Commission recently signed a Financing Agreement with Mexico for the Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project in Chiapas, Mexico. Implementation of this project has not yet begun, but is
expected to start in the coming months. [...] The project was designed with the input and participation of local stakeholders who will continue to participate in the planning and implementation process, in particular through the Micro-regional Councils (Consejos microregionales) who represent the local communities. The project is not part of the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP). It has been reported that some local communities and governments in the South/Southeast of Mexico criticise the PPP as a top-down initiative with supposedly inadequate consultation of local stakeholders. The Commission is aware of the press reports in question, and considers any suggestion of EU involvement in any act of violence in Chiapas or elsewhere to be utterly without foundation. [...] There is certainly no evidence to suggest that the reported attack was encouraged by the signing of the financing agreement for this project."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

6-1-2005: MEP '''[[Eva Lichtenberger]], question E-3589/04'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Parliament has received news that the indigenous people and those in the rural areas around Montes Azules have not been duly informed about the project and there is a great deal of mistrust. [...] Do the representatives elected to work on the project have Community support? [...] What will happen to communities which refuse to take part in this project? [...] How will support for the project be assessed in this highly militarised and conflictive region? [...] There are many displaced persons in the area of Montes Azules. What connection is there between the above project and a possible relocation of settlements for the displaced?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

24-2-2005: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer E-3589/04''' (in French [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-3589&amp;language=FR] and German [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-3589&amp;language=DE])

18-7-2005: MEP '''[[Tobias Pflüger]], question P-2769/05'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[File:Tzixcao2.JPG|thumb|right|click to enlarge]]
"According to press reports and my own local research, those belonging to the indigenous population and farmers living in the Lacandon Jungle region were not adequately informed beforehand about this project, or involved in the planning of the project. Under Article 7 of [[International Labour Organization#Indigenous peoples|ILO-convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169], indigenous population groups have to be consulted before projects may be carried out on their lands. According to human rights organisations in Europe and Mexico, the European Commission is running a risk, in financing this project, of lending support to the counter-insurgency action being waged in the context of low-intensity warfare and of exacerbating socio-economic tensions between communities, by virtue of the fact that only certain individual population groups are benefited by this project."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

16-2-2006: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer P-2769/05'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) The current Chiapas State Government, elected in 2000, qualified as beneficiary institution in this EC project due to its reconciliatory position in the conflict between federal government and ELZN, that has been recognised by the latter on several occasions. [...] After its election, the Government of Chiapas also politically assumed the principles of the San Andrés Agreement between the federal Mexican government and the EZLN, as well as the 169 ILO Convention.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The State Government’s position is sustained by the fact that one of the most delicate subjects in the Lacandona region, the agrarian (land) reform and resulting conflicts over land and delocalisation of “informal settlements” (especially in the Montes Azules area – that is not part of Prodesis’ area of intervention), are falling under federal competence. The Chiapas Government hence is not participating in the very tense negotiations between local communities and federal institutions on that issue.&lt;br /&gt;
3) From an institutional point of view, major emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within PRODESIS’ Consultative Council, whose “civil society college” currently includes 30 members of regional and national civil society organisations. The renowned Chiapas expert and EZLN’s external consultant during the negotiation of the San Andres Agreement, Professor [[Jan de Vos (historian)|Jan de Vos]], is also a member of that Consultative Council.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Comments on answer P-2769/05''' by Commissioner [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1) Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner refers to the political situation in 2000: Newly elected president Fox had promised to revive the peace process and ratify the [[Cocopa legislative proposal]] which, taken to the constitutional level, would mean the fulfillment of the [[San Andrés Accords]]. However, in April 2001 Mexican Congress adopted a diluted version of the [[Cocopa law]], which was criticised by the [[International Labour Organization]] for violating [[International Labour Organization#Indigenous peoples|ILO-convention 169]] [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111031202527/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169]. The [[EZLN]] felt betrayed and broke off all dialogue with the federal and state government and installed ''juntas de buen gobierno'' (''communities of [[Good governance]]''). Furthermore, in 2004 Ruben Velazquez Lopez (secretary of government of Chiapas) said he would "not tolerate land-occupations anymore", threatening informal settlements with eviction. So the legitimation the Commissioner gives in her answer of February 16th 2006 conceils the changed political situation between 2000 and 2004, when Prodesis started.[[File:montes-Azules+marker.jpg|thumb|right|click to enlarge]]
2) The Commissioner suggests that conflicts over land and delocalisation of ''informal settlements'' happen only in the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]], which falls under federal competence. Prodesis’ area of intervention is the Lacandon region ''around'' [[Montes Azules]], which is Chiapas territory. The Chiapas Government (beneficiary of the €15.000.000 for Prodesis), hence would not be involved in these matters. This distinction however is purely theoretical: in reality conflicts over land, [[para-military]] attacks, [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] presence, and Prodesis' 16 micro-regions are all located in the [[Lacandon region]] ''around'' the [[Montes Azules]] Reserve. This is illustrated by this map (see on the right) of Chiapas' [[Lacandon region]], with [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]] (green area) at the center. The green circles represent Prodesis projects, the blue circles represent areas with conflicts over land, and the red markings represent areas with para-military presence.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Although emphasis has been put on inclusive participation and control by civil society within Prodesis’ Consultative Council, several members of that council (among them [[Jan de Vos (historian)|Jan de Vos]] and [[Tim Trench (anthropologist)|Tim Trench]]) are critical of Prodesis' consultation process, and sceptical of its effectivity, stating that the project might indeed be worsening the situation in the region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

15-7-2008: MEP '''[[Eva Lichtenberger]], question H-0628/08'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Why was an extremely strife-torn region chosen without consulting or securing the agreement of the local population? [...] What mechanisms does the EU intend to use in order to guarantee that its projects are carried out in accordance with the provisions of the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples concerning the need to secure free and informed consent for any project being carried out on land belonging to indigenous peoples?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

25-9-2008: Commissioner '''[[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], answer H-0628/08'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At every step of the project cycle, and even now with PRODESIS in its closing stages, the Commission has been aware of the difficult political and social situation on the ground. This is reflected both by Prodesis' openness to local partner institutions, and its strong commitment to accountability to final beneficiaries and communities. During the feasibility study and formulation mission, there were multiple contacts and consultations with local beneficiaries and communities as well as national and regional civil society organisations. During the project launch and execution, each planning exercise and productive activity financed by the project necessarily depended on the prior agreement and free consent of local communities and grass-root organisations. From an institutional point of view, emphasis has been put on civil society participation and control within the project's Consultative Council, whose independent Civil Society College included approximately 30 members of regional and national Non State Actors (NSA)."

'''''The Sexual Paradox''''' is a book by [[Susan Pinker]] published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in 2008. Pinker is a psychologist and columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008&gt;
Bazelon (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sexual Paradox'' was 2009 winner of the [[American Psychological Association]]'s annual William James Book Award, a ''[[New York Times]]'' "Editor's Choice", and one of the "Best Books" reviewed by the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. &lt;!--- What is this book ABOUT?---&gt;

== Quotes ==

* "If you were to predict the future on the basis of school achievement alone ... the world would be a matriarchy." (Quoted in [[Emily Bazelon]]'s ''New York Times'' review. Bazelon goes on to note: "And yet, of course, it is not. Once they move from school to work, men on average earn more money and run more shows. They particularly dominate in national government, the corporate boardroom and the science laboratory.")&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;
* "The puzzle is why the idea of sex differences continues to be so controversial." (Quoted in Bazelon.)&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;

== Reviews ==

* "We shouldn't wish the role of sex differences away because they're at odds with feminist dogma. But that doesn't mean we should settle for the reductionist version of the relevant science, even if the complexity doesn't make for as neat a package between hard covers." — [[Emily Bazelon]], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Bazelon2008/&gt;{{clarify|reason=What on earth is this quotation demonstrating?  Is it a positive or negative review?  Is it a summary in some way?|date=December 2015}}
* "Pinker throws out the question of why women may or may not be allowed to be equal to men and posits a different one: why on earth do men get to be the standard? Why should females have the goal of meeting the male standard? This in itself denigrates females.... Pinker dares to posit the idea that women don't have the same preferences as men and therefore, might actually  choose different paths, not be forced into them by the patriarchy."  — Rebecca L. Burch, ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]''.&lt;ref name=Burch2008&gt;Burch (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[Pinker] delivers a well-referenced summary of the most up-to-date psychological research and social statistics in a cheerful style. The publicity the book has received, however, derives less from its style than its message." — [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]], ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008&gt;Campbell (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UNIGIS''' is a worldwide network of [[University|universities]] cooperating since 1992 in the design, development and delivery of [[distance learning]] in ''[[GIS|Geographical Information Science and Systems]]'' (GIS). Members of the UNIGIS network offer [[Postgraduate Certificate]], [[Postgraduate Diploma|Diploma]] and [[Master's degree|Masters]] courses in GIS by open and distance learning, following the mission of ''Educating GIS Professionals Worldwide''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unigis.net/about&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the UNIGIS network also work together in research and curriculum development activities related to [[Geographic information system|GIS]] education. Programmes and courses are under continuous development and are currently being offered in [http://www.unigis.org/ English], [http://www.unigis.ac.at/ German], Hungarian, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080215004734/http://www.unigis.pt/ Portuguese], Spanish and Polish languages. UNIGIS each year enrolls more than 600 new students worldwide.

==UNIGIS courses==
UNIGIS courses are modular and flexible study programmes. The content varies to meet local student needs. Optional courses give the opportunity to tailor the programme to meet individual student needs, and residential workshops are offered to support areas of the courses. Topics covered in the UNIGIS courses include:
*[[Space|Spatial Data]]
*[[Database theory|Database Theory]]
*[[Geoinformation|Geodata Sources]]
*[[GIS]] and Organisations

'''Universology''' literally means "the science of the [[universe]]." Popularizing universologic science was a life's work for 19th century intellectual [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a [[futurology|futurist]] [[utopia]]n. The word can be used synonymously with [[consilience]], a term [[Edward Osborne Wilson]] has popularized with his writings elucidating the apparent unity of all knowledge.

In recent years, Dr. [[Mamoru Mohri]], [[Japan]]'s first [[astronaut]] and Director of Japan's [[Miraikan|National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation]], has popularized and expanded on universology. For Mohri the universological worldview was an epiphany after seeing the planet from space on two missions in the 1990s, and he has become the chief proponent of universology today. "Everything in this universe is part of an uninterrupted sequence of events" Mohri has said.

In 1872 [[Stephen Pearl Andrews|Andrews]] published "The Basic Outline of Universology" which was subtitled "An introduction to the newly discovered science of the universe, its elementary principles, and the first stages of their development in the special sciences."

[[Ilya Romanovich Prigogine]] (born on January 25, 1917) was a Belgian and American physicist and chemist who was born in Russia and became a Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. In the book "Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue With Nature", which he co-wrote with [[Isabelle Stengers]], another professor at Prigogine's group in the University of Brussels, Prigogine states:

"Altogether, we tend to accept the idea propelled by Dialectical Materialism, regarding the necessity of overcoming the antithesis of humane, historical realm and the material world, perceived as atemporal. We do believe, that the setting rapprochement of these opposites will have to be enhanced, as there will be new approaches which will outline the internally evolving Universe, which we are part of." A central aspect of the ways of "outlining the internally evolving Universe", that is what Universology is all about.
