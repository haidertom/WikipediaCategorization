The '''adsorption/bio-oxidation process''' is a two-stage modification of the [[activated sludge]] process used for [[wastewater treatment]]. It consists of a high-loaded A-stage and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary [[clarifier]], with the A-stage being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.

==History==
[[Adsorption]]/bio-oxidation process was invented in the mid-1970s by the professor of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] Botho Böhnke. It was based on the finding, made by the German engineer [[Karl Imhoff]] in the 50th.{{Explain|date=March 2017}} Imhoff stated that the treatment efficiency of 60-80 percent could be achieved in highly loaded activated sludge basins.

In 1977 Böhnke published his first article on adsorption/bio-oxidation process.&lt;ref&gt;Böhnke B. (1977). Das Adsorptions-Belebungsverfahren. Korrespondenz Abwasser, 24. Jahrg., 2/77&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the patent was issued. Extensive research of the following years, conducted by prof. Böhnke together with Bernd and Andreas Diering, ended up in 1985 with the establishment of the company Dr.-Ing. Bernd Diering GmbH. The same year AB-process was for the first time applied in a full-scale at the [[Krefeld]], Germany [[sewage treatment]] plant (800 000 P.E.). In 1990, 19 full scale installations existed in Western Germany alone. Further application of the process in Europe was hindered by the tightening of the effluent discharge requirements with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. The process came into notice in 2000th again due to the increased interest in [[energy recovery]] from [[wastewater]].

==Principle of operation==
The A-stage, or [[adsorption]] stage is the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by [[primary treatment]]. [[File:AB process scheme.png|thumb|Simple schematic description of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process]] Influent organic matter is removed in the A-stage mainly by [[flocculation]] and [[sorption]] to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g [[Volatile suspended solids|VSS]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). [[Hydrolysis]] of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic [[biocoenosis]] with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the A-stage and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional [[activated sludge]] process.

The B-stage, or bio-oxidation stage, is a typical low-loaded activated sludge process, where [[biodegradation]] of the remaining organic material occurs. The B-stage can be designed for nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal by alternating aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones in the reactor.

===Typical operational conditions of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process===

===Advantages of the process===
* Lower aeration requirements decrease energy consumption and aeration costs for 20 percent if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c09/E4-11-06-03.pdf Technologies that Transform. Pollutants into Innocuous Components]. www.eolss.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* The volumes of [[Activated sludge#Process description|aeration tanks]] are 40% lower if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.&lt;ref name=eolss/&gt;
* Increased sludge production in the A-stage results in increased [[biogas]] production in the [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]] (for plants with [[anaerobic digestion]] of excess sludge).&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44&gt;[http://waterenenergie.stowa.nl/upload/publicaties/STOWA%202010-44%20European%20report%20100208%20-%20update.pdf Energy efficiency in the European water industry]. Stowa report #2010-44&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stability towards the shock loads (pH, [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), toxic substances) explained by the wide-ranging biochemical potential, high mutation capacity and adaptability of sludge in the A-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2&gt;Boehnke, B., Diering, B., &amp; Zuckut, S. W. (1997). AB process removes organics and nutrients. Water Environment and Technology, 9(3), 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A-stage can receive higher organic loads than conventional activated sludge systems.
* Effluent concentrations are more stable because of the two-stage process configuration employed.
* Heavy metals are mainly removed with the A-stage sludge. Therefore, B-stage sludge has lower concentrations of heavy metals than sludge from conventional activated sludge process and may comply with the agricultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J.-L., Zhang, J.-T., Chen, X.,`Yi, H.-X. (2011). Characteristics of heavy-metal translating in adsorption and biodegradation activated sludge process. International Conference on Electric Technology and Civil Engineering, ICETCE 2011 - Proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks of the process===
* Incomplete denitrification is often observed in the B-stage if the influent C/N ratio is low. Direct by-pass of a part of A-stage influent with high organic matter content to the B-stage is used to increase the C/N ratio.
* High sludge production in the A-stage is a drawback for WWTPs that are not equipped with anaerobic digestion of sludge, because it increases sludge treatment costs.
* Sludge from A-stage has poor settling properties.&lt;ref name=stowa2010-44/&gt;

==Nutrient removal==
Nitrogen removal in the A-stage can reach 30-40%, as nitrogen of organic compounds is incorporated in [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactor sludge.

The sludge age of the B-stage is typically between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of [[Nitrification|nitrifiers]]. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt; Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.&lt;ref name=wenyi&gt;Wenyi, D., Hong, D., Li-an, Z., Jia, M., Baozhen, W. (2006). Operational retrofits of AB process for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water Practice &amp; Technology, 1 (4) doi: 10.2166/WPT.2006078&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage.

Phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of the B-stage can be achieved by coagulation with ferric and aluminium salts, e.g. FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, J.-L., Shen, X., Peng, Z., Wang, Q. (2011). Study on the phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of AB process by ferric chloride. 5th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, ICBBE 2011 - Proceedings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Y.-Y., Luo, X.-X., Cheng, J.-H., Luo, G. (2008). Experimental investigation of chemically-enhanced phosphorus removal with adsorption-biodegradation process. Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for municipal wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process was applied at the Krefeld plant (800 000 P.E.) in 1985 for the first time. The plant was expanded and modified and currently treats municipal and industrial wastewater of 1 200 000 P.E.&lt;ref name=boehnke2/&gt;

Currently adsorption/bio-oxidation process is applied at the municipal treatment plants in [[Germany]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] (WWTP Dokhaven (Rotterdam), WWTP Utrecht, WWTP Garmerwolde (Groningen) etc.), [[Austria]] (WWTP Salzburg, WWTP Strass etc.), [[Spain]], [[United States|USA]], [[China]] etc.&lt;ref name=stowa2&gt;[http://www.stowa.nl/Upload/Presentatie%20Marthe%20de%20Graaff%20%28Inventarisatie%20van%20AB-systemen%20in%20NL%29%20%282%29.pdf Inventarisatie van AB-systemen in NL]. www.stowa.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is a part of innovative wastewater treatment concept WaterSchoon, realized in the Netherlands. 250 apartments in the new district Noorderhoek ([[Sneek]], the Netherlands) are equipped with separate collection systems for toilet wastewater and the rest of the household wastewater (or so-called [[greywater]]). Both streams are treated separately in order to maximize recovery of resources from wastewater. Adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for grey water treatment to increase sludge production. Sludge, produced in both stages of the process, is digested together with toilet wastewater in the UASB reactor to maximize energy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterschoon.nl/index.htm]. www.waterschoon.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications for industrial wastewater treatment==
The adsorption/bio-oxidation process is used for treatment of [[industrial wastewater]] with high COD, including wastewater from:
* [[Environmental impact of paper#Water pollution|Pulp and paper industry]]&lt;ref name=knudsen&gt;Knudsen, L., Pedersen, J. A., &amp; Munck, J. (1994). Advanced treatment of paper mill effluents by a two-stage activated sludge process. Water Science and Technology, 30 (3), 173-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Textile industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer&gt;Schulze-Rettmer, R., Kim, S. S., &amp; Son, S. S. (1992). Experience with two-stage activated sludge plants for industrial wastewaters in Korea. Water Science and Technology, 25 (4-5), 427-428.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Food industry|Food industry]], including dairy industry &lt;ref name=100years&gt;Jenkins, D. &amp; Wanner, J, (Eds.) (2014). Activated Sludge - 100 Years and Counting. IWA publishing {{ISBN|9781780404943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical industry]]&lt;ref name=100years/&gt;
* [[Tanning (leather)#Health and environmental impact|Leather tanning industry]]&lt;ref name=schulze-rettmer/&gt;

The C/N and C/P ratios of industrial wastewater is often too high for complete aerobic [[biodegradation]] of the influent organic matter, even after the adsorption stage. Addition of nutrients prior to bio-oxidation stage is required in these cases.&lt;ref name=knudsen/&gt;

'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''55''' (3): 385–399. {{doi|10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Glossary/demo_glossary.cgi?mode=history&amp;term_id=1196 Authentic life]. Psychology Centre Athabasca University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://castle.eiu.edu/~psych/spencer/Existential.html "Existential Psychology"]. Eastern Illinois University. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603121545/http://castle.eiu.edu/~psych/spencer/Existential.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.
[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as "poseurs" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]
Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna. "I Bang My Head, Therefore I Am: Constructing Individual and Social Authenticity in the Heavy Metal Subculture" in ''Young.'' 21 (1). 2013. p. 95-110&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Black metal]], an [[extreme metal]] genre, sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} In the metal and hardcore punk subcultures, a band that began from a working class milieu that later signs to a major record label for a lucrative recording contract may be deemed to have "[[sell out|sold out]]" and lost their authenticity. In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

===In marketing===

In marketing brand authenticity is defined as the degree to which brand identity is causally linked to brand behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Schallehn, Mike; Burmann, Christoph; Riley, Nicola (2014).

Although currently a [[Theravada]] Buddhism flourishing country, the [[Mahayana]] cult of worshipping '''Bodhisattva statues''' has existed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Archaeological evidences show that [[Bodhisattva]] cult had existed as a secondary cult inferior to worship of [[Buddha]] during the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sanath Dharmabandu|title=චිත්‍ර හා මූර්ති කලාව|publisher=M.

==History==
During the middle [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]], [[Bodhisattva]] cult became very popular in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=වෙහෙරගල අව‍ලෝකිතේශ්වර බෝධිසත්ත්ව මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early period, [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]] was predominantly flourished with [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravāda]] Buddhist ideas. Later, [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] aspects were developed. In the [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, [[Bodhisattva]]s were worshipped with a major significance. During the [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] it is mentioned that, [[Mahasena of Anuradhapura|King Mahāsēna]] had built Bodhisattva images.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura|King Dhatusena]] (459–477 CE) had built a statue of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nandadeva Wijesekara|title=පැරණි සිංහල ප්‍රතිමා ශිල්පය|publisher=M.

During 7th–10th centuries AD, [[Mahayana]] Buddhism had spread along the [[Sri Lanka]]n territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is evidenced by many surviving Bodhisattva statues and carvings belonging to the period. It is mentioned that King [[Dappula I of Anuradhapura]] had built a 15 cubits-high [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ruhuna]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This image is believed to be the recently restored [[Dambegoda Bodhisattva statue]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an evidence for the strong Maitreya cult in ancient Sri Lanka.

[[Bhuvanaikabahu IV of Gampola|King Bhuwanekabāhu IV]] of [[Kingdom of Gampola|Gampola]] has built Maitreya and [[Natha (Buddhist deity)|Nātha]] (Avalokitesvara) statues in [[Lankatilaka Vihara]]. It is mentioned that King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|Kirti Sri Rajasinghe]] had built a [[Maitreya]] image in [[Ridi Viharaya]]. ''Dambulu Viahara thudapatha'', a text dated to1780 CE mentions about some Maitreya and Nātha images of the temple. These images can be seen flanking the standing Buddha near the central entrance of [[Dambulla cave temple]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types== 
Both male and female [[Bodhisattva]] images has found from [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Avalokitesvara]] images play a significant role among the statuary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also various statues of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]], the wife of Avalokitesvara has found. It is assumed that cult of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tārā]] may have been popular in ancient Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ranjith Hewage|title=විස්මිත අතීත උරුමයන්|publisher=Susara Publishers |date=2012 |chapter=තාරා දෙවඟන මූර්තිය|isbn=9789556761658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of [[Maitreya]] are also common. Statues of Bodhisattvas [[Vajrapani]] and [[Manjushri]] has found in Sri Lanka.

[[Bronze]], stone and [[ivory]] has used as the medium to create Bodhisattva images.

==Examples==
[[File:British Museum Asia 45 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Tara]]; [[British Museum]].]]
The [[Veheragala Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva]], currently displayed at [[Colombo National Museum]], is considered as the finest Bodhisattva image ever found in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This [[bronze]] statue belonging to [[Kingdom of Anuradhapura|Anuradhapura period]] is delicately designed. Also the [[Statue of Tara]], which is now housed in [[British Museum]] is considered as a masterpiece of Sri Lankan art.

'''Body image law''' is the  developing area of law that,  according to Dr Marilyn Bromberg of the [[University of Western Australia]] Law School and Cindy Halliwell, a law student at [[Deakin University]], "encompasses the bills, laws and government actions (such as establishing parliamentary inquiries and creating policies) that may help to improve the [[body image]] of the general public, and particularly of young people".&lt;ref name="mb/ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromberg|first1=Marilyn|last2=Halliwell|first2=Cindy|title=All About That Bass’ and Photoshopping a Model’s Waist: Introducing Body Image Law|journal=The University of Notre Dame Australia Law Review|date=2016|volume=18|url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/undalr/vol18/iss1/1/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for implementing law in this area is to prevent the images of unhealthily thin women causing poor body image which can, along with other factors, lead to an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name="mb/ch" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]] passed a body image law in 2012 which became operational the following year. The law requires models to have a minimum [[body mass index]] to work and if an image was photoshopped to make the model appear thinner, it must have a warning. The warning must state that the image was modified and it must take up at least seven percent of the image. Breaches can result in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel: Restrictions on Depiction of Underweight Models in Commercials|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-restrictions-on-depiction-of-underweight-models-in-commercials/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[French Government]]  passed a similar law in 2015 which came into effect in 2017. This law requires that models provide their employers with a "medical certificate, valid for up to two years, confirming their general physical well-being and the fact that they are not excessively underweight." &lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI of models older than 16 will also be taken into consideration, when determining their overall health.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

The [[Greater London Authority]] banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image on [[Transport for London]] public transport in 2016.&lt;ref name="ap/mo"&gt;{{cite news|title=London mayor bans Tube ads that promote unhealthy body image|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3640626/London-mayor-takes-aim-body-shaming-advertising-Tube.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[Mail Online]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Trondheim]] in Norway banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image in public places in 2017.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Gabriel|title=Norwegian city bans adverts featuring semi-nude models|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-trondheim-ban-adverts-semi-naked-models-negative-body-image-a7026421.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians use [[Chord (music)#Notation|various kinds]] of '''chord names and symbols''' in different contexts, to represent [[Chord (music)|musical chords]]. In most [[List of popular music genres|genres]] of [[popular music]], including [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[rock music|rock]], a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more of the following parts:
# The [[root (chord)|root note]] (e.g., C).
# The [[#Chord quality|chord quality]] (e.g., [[Minor chord|minor]] or lowercase m, or the symbols ° or + for diminished and augmented chords; quality is usually omitted for major chords). 
# The [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] of an [[Interval (music)|interval]] (e.g., seventh, or 7), or less often, its full [[Interval (music)#Interval number and quality|name or symbol]] (e.g., [[major seventh]], maj7, or M7).
# The [[#Altered fifths|altered fifth]] (e.g., [[augmented fifth|sharp five]], or {{Music|#}}5).
# An additional interval number (e.g., add 2 or add2), in [[added tone chord]]s. For instance, the name [[augmented seventh chord|C augmented seventh]], and the corresponding symbol Caug&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, or C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, are both composed of parts 1, 2, and 3.
# Often, a bass note other than the root is indicated after a forward slash, following or slightly under the rest of the chord notation--for example, "GM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/B" would indicate a G major seventh chord, with B, not G, as the bass or bottom note.
Except for the root, these parts do not refer to the notes that form the chord, but to the intervals they form with respect to the root note. For instance, Caug&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; indicates a chord formed by the notes C–E–G{{Music|#}}–B{{Music|b}}. The three parts of the symbol (C, aug, and 7) refer to the root C, the [[Augmented fifth|augmented (fifth)]] interval from C to G{{Music|#}}, and the [[Minor seventh|(minor) seventh]] interval from C to B{{Music|b}}. A set of [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|decoding rules]] is applied to deduce the missing information.

Although they are used occasionally in [[classical music]], typically in an educational setting for [[harmonic analysis]], these names and symbols are "universally used in jazz and popular music",&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.&amp;nbsp;78.
Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[lead sheet]]s, [[fake books]], and [[chord chart]]s, to specify the [[chord (music)|chords]] that make up the [[chord progression]] of a [[song]] or other piece of music. A typical sequence of a jazz or rock song in the key of C major might indicate a chord progression such as "C – Am – Dm – G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;". This chord progression instructs the performer to play, in sequence, a "C Major" chord, an "A minor" chord, a "D minor" chord, and a "G dominant seventh" chord. In a jazz context, players have the freedom to add sevenths, ninths and higher extensions to the chord. In some pop, rock and folk genres, triads are generally performed unless specified in the chord chart (e.g., C Major 7).

==Roles==
These chord symbols are used by musicians for a number of purposes. Chord-playing instrumentalists in the [[rhythm section]] of a [[jazz quartet]], [[band (rock and pop)|rock or pop band]] or [[big band]], such as a [[piano]] player, [[Hammond organ]]ist or [[electric guitar]]ist use these symbols to guide their [[music improvisation|improvised]] performance of [[Voicing (music)|chord "voicings"]] and [[Fill (music)|"fills"]]. A rock or pop guitarist or keyboardist might literally play the chords just as indicated (e.g., the C major chord would be played by playing the notes C, E and G at the same time). In jazz, particularly for music from the 1940s [[Bebop]] era or later, a guitarist or keyboardist typically has latitude to add in the sixth, seventh, and/or ninth, according to "ear" and judgement. Jazz chord voicings often omit the root (leaving it to the bass player) and fifth. As such, a jazz guitarist might "voice" the C major chord with the notes E, A and D—which are the third, sixth, and ninth of the chord. The bassist ([[bass guitar|electric bass]] or [[double bass]]) uses the chord symbols to help improvise a [[bass line]] that outlines the chords, often by emphasizing the root and other key scale tones (third, fifth, and in a jazz context, the seventh).

The "lead instruments" in a jazz band or rock group, such as a [[saxophone]] player or [[lead guitar]]ist use the chord chart to guide their improvised solos. The instrumentalist improvising a solo may use [[scale (music)|scales]] that work well with certain chords or chord progressions. For example, in rock and blues soloing, the [[pentatonic scale]] built on the root note is widely used to solo over straightforward chord progressions that use I, IV and V chords (in the key of C major, these would be the chords C, F and G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;).

Other [[Chord (music)#Notation|notation systems for chords]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.&amp;nbsp;77. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plain [[Staff (music)|staff notation]], used in classical music, [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], commonly used in [[Harmony|harmonic analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, Arnold (1983). ''Structural Functions of Harmony'', p.1–2. Faber and Faber. 0393004783&lt;/ref&gt; [[figured bass]], much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], and [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern [[musicology]].

== Advantages and limitations ==
Any chord can be denoted using [[staff (music)|staff notation]], showing not only its harmonic characteristics but also its exact [[voicing (music)|voicing]]. However, this notation, frequently used in classical music, may provide too much information, making [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] difficult. In fact, although voicings can and do have a significant effect on the subjective musical qualities of a [[Musical composition|composition]], generally these interpretations retain the central characteristics of the chord. This provides an opportunity for improvisation within a defined structure and is important to improvised music such as [[jazz]]. Other problems are that voicings for one instrument are not necessarily physically playable on another (for example, the [[thirteenth chord]], played on [[piano]] with up to seven notes, is usually played on [[guitar]] as a 4- or 5-note voicing that is impossible to play on piano with one hand).

As a result of these limitations, popular music and jazz use a shorthand that describes the harmonic characteristics of chords. The first part of a symbol for a chord defines the root of the chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the instruments in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument). Failure to include the root means that the indicated chord may be hard to hear for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.

This notation does not easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords can be very difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are six possible [[permutation]]s of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, but the question of what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which would strike most musicians as odd. In fact, this turns out to be the same as F/A bass (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;.

Usually, when composers require a chord that is not easily described using this notation, they indicate the required chord in a footnote or in the header of the music. Alternatively, chords can be specified with more detailed numbers. For example, for a C9 chord with no seventh, the composer can write C9 (no 7th), because the normal rule in jazz is that in a ninth chord, the seventh is assumed.

== Chord quality ==
Chord qualities are related with the [[Interval (music)#Quality|qualities]] of the component [[Interval (music)|intervals]] that define the chord (see below). The main chord qualities are:
:* [[Major chord|Major]], and [[Minor chord|minor]].
:* [[Augmented chord|Augmented]], [[Diminished seventh chord|diminished]], and [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]].
:* [[dominant chord|Dominant]].

Some of the symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|interval quality]]:
:* No symbol, or sometimes '''M''' or '''Maj''' (see rule 2 [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|below]]) for major,
:* '''m''', or '''min''' for minor,
:* '''aug''' for augmented,
:* '''dim''' for diminished.

In addition, however,

:*'''{{music|delta}}''' is sometimes used for major,{{efn
| name=ambiguous
| The symbol {{music|major}} is ambiguous, as it is used by some as a synonym for M (e.g., C{{music|major}} {{=}} CM and C{{music|major}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;), and by others as a synonym of M&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g., C{{music|major}} {{=}} CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;).
}} instead of the standard M, or maj,
:* '''−''' is sometimes used for minor, instead of the standard m or min,
:*a lowercase root note is sometimes used for minor, e.g. '''c''' instead of '''Cm''',
:*'''+''', or '''aug''', is used for augmented ('''A''' is not used),
:*'''{{music|dim}}''', '''°''', '''dim''', is used for diminished ('''d''' is not used),
:*'''{{music|halfdim}}''', or '''&lt;sup&gt;Ø&lt;/sup&gt;''' is used for half diminished,
:*'''dom''' may occasionally be used for dominant.

Chord qualities are sometimes omitted (see [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|below]]). When specified, they appear immediately after the root note or, if the root is omitted, at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the symbol Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (C [[minor seventh chord]]) C is the root and m is the chord quality. When the terms minor, major, augmented, diminished, or the corresponding symbols do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered [[Interval (music)#Quality|interval qualities]], rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; ([[minor major seventh chord]]), m is the chord quality and M refers to the M7 interval.

=== Major, minor, augmented, and diminished chords ===
Three-note chords are called [[Triad (music)|triads]]. There are four ''basic triads'' ([[Major triad|major]], [[Minor triad|minor]], [[Augmented triad|augmented]], [[Diminished triad|diminished]]). They are all [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]]—which means defined by the root, a third, and a [[fifth (interval)|fifth]]. Since most other chords are made by adding one or more notes to these triads, the name and symbol of a chord is often built by just adding an [[Interval (music)#Number|interval number]] to the name and symbol of a triad. For instance, a C [[augmented seventh chord]] is a C [[augmented triad]] with an extra note defined by a [[minor seventh]] interval:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C+ || + || m7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;triad&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;minor&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}
In this case, the [[Interval (music)#Quality|quality]] of the additional interval is omitted. Less often, the full name or symbol of the additional interval (minor, in the example) is provided. For instance, a C [[augmented major seventh chord]] is a C augmented triad with an extra note defined by a [[major seventh]] interval:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| C+&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C+ || + || M7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;triad&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In both cases, ''the quality of the chord is the same as the quality of the basic triad it contains''. This is not true for all chord qualities, as the chord qualities "half-diminished", and "dominant" refer not only to the quality of the basic triad, but also to the quality of the additional intervals.

=== Altered fifths ===
A more complex approach is sometimes used to name and denote augmented and diminished chords. An augmented triad can be viewed as a major triad in which the [[perfect fifth]] interval (spanning 7 [[semitone]]s) has been substituted with an [[augmented fifth]] (8 semitones), and a diminished triad as a minor triad in which the perfect fifth has been substituted with a [[diminished fifth]] (6 semitones). In this case, the augmented triad can be named ''major triad sharp five'', or ''major triad augmented fifth'' (M&lt;sup&gt;{{Music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;, maj&lt;sup&gt;aug5&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, the diminished triad can be named ''minor triad flat five'', or ''minor triad diminished fifth'' (m&lt;sup&gt;{{Music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, m&lt;sup&gt;°5&lt;/sup&gt;, min&lt;sup&gt;dim5&lt;/sup&gt;).

Again, the terminology and notation used for triads affects the terminology and notation used for larger chords, formed by four or more notes. For instance, the above-mentioned C augmented major seventh chord, is sometimes called ''C major seventh sharp five'', or ''C major seventh augmented fifth''. The corresponding symbol is CM&lt;sup&gt;7+5&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sup&gt;7{{Music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cmaj&lt;sup&gt;7aug5&lt;/sup&gt;:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| CM&lt;sup&gt;7+5&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C || + || M3 || + || A5 || + || M7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;chord&lt;br&gt;root&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}
:(In chord symbols, [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|the symbol A]], used for augmented intervals, is typically replaced by + or {{Music|#}})
In this case, the chord is viewed as a C [[major seventh chord]] (CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) in which the third note is an augmented fifth from root (G{{Music|#}}), rather than a perfect fifth from root (G). All chord names and symbols including altered fifths, i.e., augmented ({{Music|#}}5, +5, aug5) or diminished ({{Music|b}}5, °5, dim5) fifths can be interpreted in a similar way.

== Rules to decode chord names and symbols ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The amount of information provided in a chord name or symbol lean toward the minimum, to increase efficiency. However, it is often necessary to deduce from a chord name or symbol the component intervals that define the chord. The missing information is implied and must be deduced according to some conventional rules:

# '''General rule to interpret existing information about chord quality'''
#: For triads, [[Major third|major]] or [[Minor third|minor]] always refer to the third interval, while [[Augmented fifth|augmented]] and [[Diminished fifth|diminished]] always refer to the fifth (an augmented fifth above the root and a diminished fifth above the root, respectively). The same is true for the corresponding symbols (e.g., Cm means C&lt;sup&gt;m3&lt;/sup&gt;, and C+ means C&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, the terms third and [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] and the corresponding symbols 3 and 5 are typically omitted. It is assumed that the chord-playing musician plays the 3rd and 5th above the root, so this is not explicitly stated.
#: This rule can be generalized to all kinds of chords,{{efn
| name=rule1
| General rule 1 achieves consistency in the interpretation of symbols such as CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Some musicians legitimately prefer to think that, in CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, M refers to the seventh, rather than to the third. This alternative approach is legitimate, as both the third and seventh are major, yet it is inconsistent, as a similar interpretation is impossible for Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (in Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, m cannot possibly refer to the sixth, which is major by definition, and in C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, + cannot refer to the seventh, which is minor). Both approaches reveal only one of the intervals (M3 or M7), and require other rules to complete the task. Whatever is the decoding method, the result is the same (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is always conventionally decoded as C–E–G–B, implying M3, P5, M7). The advantage of rule 1 is that it has no exceptions, which makes it the simplest possible approach to decode chord quality.&lt;br&gt;
According to the two approaches, some may format the minor seventh as CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (general rule 1: M refers to M3), and others as C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; (alternative approach: M refers to M7). Fortunately, even C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; becomes compatible with rule 1 if it is considered an abbreviation of CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;, in which the first M is omitted. The omitted M is the quality of the third, and is deduced according to rule 2 (see above), consistently with the interpretation of the plain symbol C, which by the same rule stands for CM and also in other variants.
}} provided the above-mentioned qualities appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the chord symbols Cm and Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, m refers to the interval m3, and 3 is omitted. When these qualities do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered [[Interval (music)#Quality|interval qualities]], rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm/M7 ([[minor-major seventh chord]]), m is the chord quality and refers to the m3 interval, while M refers to the M7 interval. When the [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] of an extra interval is specified immediately after chord quality, the quality of that interval may coincide with chord quality (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;). However, this is not always true (e.g., Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = Cm&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;, C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C+&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;P11&lt;/sup&gt;).{{efn|name=rule1}} See specific rules below for further details.
# '''General rule to deduce missing information about chord quality'''
#: Without contrary information, a [[major third]] interval and a [[perfect fifth]] interval ([[major triad]]) are implied. For instance, a C chord is a C major triad, and the name C minor seventh (Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) implies a minor 3rd by rule 1, a perfect 5th by this rule, and a [[Minor seventh|minor 7th]] by definition (see below). This rule has one exception (see the first specific rule below). The chord built on the fifth scale degree, the [[dominant chord]], is often interpreted as a [[dominant seventh]] chord, even if the chord chart does not specifically indicate this. For example, for a song in the key of C Major, if a G chord is indicated, many chord-playing musicians instinctively play a G7 chord. In [[blues]], if a song indicates "C, F, and G" as the chords, many blues guitarists and blues pianists play "C7, F7, and G7", as using dominant seventh chords in place of major chords is an idiomatic part of the blues sound.
#'''Specific rules'''
#: When the fifth interval is [[Diminished fifth|diminished]], the third must be minor.{{efn
| All triads are [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]] chords (chords defined by sequences of thirds), and a major third would produce in this case a non-tertian chord. Namely, the diminished fifth spans 6 semitones from root, thus it may be decomposed into a sequence of two [[minor third]]s, each spanning 3 semitones (m3 + m3), compatible with the definition of tertian chord. If a major third were used (4 semitones), this would entail a sequence containing a major second (M3 + M2 {{=}} 4 + 2 semitones {{=}} 6 semitones), which would not meet the definition of tertian chord.
}} This rule overrides rule 2. For instance, Cdim&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; implies a diminished 5th by rule 1, a minor 3rd by this rule, and a diminished 7th by definition (see below).
#:Names and symbols with only a plain [[Interval (music)#Number|interval number]] (e.g., “Seventh chord”) or the chord root and a number (e.g., “C seventh”, or C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) are interpreted as follows:
#::*If the number is 2, 4, 6, etc., the chord is a major [[added tone chord]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;add6&lt;/sup&gt;) and contains, together with the implied major triad, an extra [[Major second|major 2nd]], [[Perfect fourth|perfect 4th]], or [[Major sixth|major 6th]] (see [[#Added tone chords|below]]). Note that 2 and 4 are sometimes also used to abbreviate [[suspended chord]]s (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;sus2&lt;/sup&gt;).
#::*If the number is 7, 9, 11, 13, etc., the chord is [[Dominant chord|dominant]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = Cdom&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) and contains, together with the implied major triad, one or more of the following extra intervals: minor 7th, major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th (see [[#Seventh chords|Seventh chords]] and [[#Extended chords|Extended chords]] below).
#::*If the number is 5, the chord (technically not a chord in the traditional sense, but a [[dyad (music)|dyad]]) is a [[power chord]]. Only the root, a perfect fifth and usually an octave are played.
#: For [[sixth chord]] names or symbols composed only of root, [[Interval (music)#Number|quality]] and [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] (such as "C major sixth", or "CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;"):
#::* M, maj, or major stands for ''major-major'' (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* m, min, or minor stands for ''minor-major'' (e.g., Cm6 means Cm&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;).
#: For [[seventh chord]] names or symbols composed only of root, quality and number (such as "C major seventh", or "CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;"):
#::* dom, or dominant stands for ''major-minor'' (e.g., Cdom&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;), COMMON FAULT, THIS IS NOT THE C Dominant seventh chord  (ref** ref 8)        C-E-G-Bb is FDom7, CDom7 = G-B-D-F refer to Grove, Oxford, Collins etc
#::* M, maj, or major stands for ''major-major'' (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* m, min, or minor stands for ''minor-minor'' (e.g., Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means Cm&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* +, aug, or augmented stands for ''augmented-minor'' (e.g., C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C+&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* {{music|dim}}, dim, or diminished stands for ''diminished-diminished'' (e.g., C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;{{music|dim}}7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* {{music|halfdim}}, or half-diminished stands for ''diminished-minor'' (e.g., C{{music|halfdim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;).
#:Other specific rules for [[Extended chord|extended]] and [[Added tone chord|added tone]] chords are given below.

=== Examples ===
The table shows the application of these generic and specific rules to interpret some of the main chord symbols. The same rules apply for the analysis of chord names. A limited amount of information is explicitly provided in the chord symbol ('''[[boldface]]''' font in the column labeled "Component intervals"), and can be interpreted with rule 1. The rest is implied (plain font), and can be deduced by applying the other rules. The "Analysis of symbol parts" is performed by applying rule 1.

For each symbol, several formatting options are available. Except for the root, all the other parts of the symbols may be either [[superscript]]ed or [[subscript]]ed. Sometimes, parts of the symbol may be separated by a [[Slash notation|slash]], or written within [[parentheses]]. 
For instance:
* CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; may be written CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, or C&lt;sub&gt;M7&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; may be written as Cm&lt;sub&gt;M7&lt;/sub&gt;, Cm/M7, Cm(M7), or simply CmM7.

Short and long symbols for chord quality (such as ''m'' for minor and ''maj'' for major, respectively) are sometimes both used in the same chord symbol. For instance:
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; may be also written Cm&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Intervals ==
{{Main|Interval (music)}}
A chord consists of two or more notes played simultaneously that are certain intervals apart with respect to the chord root.

== Triads ==
{{Main|Triad (music)}}
As earlier suggested, the root written alone indicates a simple [[major chord|major triad]]. It consists of the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. [[Minor chord|Minor triads]] are the same as major triads, but with the third lowered by a [[semitone|half step]]. [[Augmented triad]]s are the same as a major triad, but with an [[augmented fifth]] instead of a [[perfect fifth]]. [[Diminished triad]]s are similar to minor triads, but with a [[diminished fifth]] instead of a perfect fifth (the minor third is retained).

The table below shows names, symbols and definition for the four kinds of triads (using C as root).

== Seventh chords ==
{{Main|Seventh chord}}
A [[seventh chord]] is a triad with an added note, which is either a [[major seventh]] above the root, a [[minor seventh]] above the root (flatted 7th), or a [[diminished seventh]] above the root (double flatted 7th). Note that the diminished seventh note is [[enharmonically equivalent]] to the [[major sixth]] above the root of the chord. When not otherwise specified, the name "seventh chord" may more specifically refer to a [[major triad]] with an added minor seventh (a [[seventh chord]]).

The table below shows names, symbols, and definitions for the various kinds of seventh chords (using C as root).

For each symbol, several formatting options are available. See [[#Examples|Examples]] above for further details.

Some 7th chords can be considered as triad chords with [[alternate bass]]. For instance,
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E{{music|b}}–G–B{{music|b}} = E{{music|b}}/C
* Cmaj&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–G–B = Em/C

== Extended chords ==
{{Main|Extended chord}}
[[Extended chords]] add further notes onto 7th chords. Of the 7 notes in the major scale, a seventh chord uses only four (root, a third above the root, a fifth above the root and a seventh above the root). The other three notes (the second above the root, the fourth above the root and the sixth above the root) can be added in any combination; however, just as with the triads and seventh chords, notes are most commonly stacked&amp;nbsp;– a seventh implies that there is a fifth and a third and a root. In practice, especially in jazz, certain notes can be omitted without changing the quality of the chord. In a jazz ensemble with a bass player, the chord-playing instrumentalists (guitar, organ, piano, etc.) can omit the root, as the bass player typically incorporates this into the [[bassline]]. 

The 9th, 11th and 13th chords are known as extended [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]] chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are [[enharmonically equivalent]] to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th&amp;nbsp;– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, this does not mean that they must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).

The convention is that using an odd number (7 or 9 or 11 or 13) implies that all the other lower odd numbers are also included. Thus C13 implies that 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 are also there. Using an even number such as 6, implies that only that one extra note has been added to the base triad e.g. 1, 3, 5, 6. Remember that this is theory, so in practice they do not have to be played in that ascending order e.g. 5, 1, 6, 3. Also,to resolve the clash between 3 and 11(AKA 4) one of them may be deleted or separated by an octave and/or, distributed to different colour(timbre) instruments. Another way to resolve might be to covert the chord to minor by flattening the 3rd, which generates a clash between the flat 3rd and the 9th(AKA 2). 

=== 9ths ===
9th chords are built by adding a 9th from the root to a seventh chord. A 9th chord includes the 7th. Without the 7th, the chord is not an extended chord, but becomes an [[added tone chord]]—in this case, an add 9. 9ths can be added to any chord, but are most commonly seen with major, dominant, and minor sevenths. The most commonly omitted note for a voicing is the perfect 5th.

The table below shows  names, symbols, and definitions for the various kinds of ninth chords (using C as root)

NOTE

=== 11ths ===
These are theoretically 9th chords with the 11th (4th) note in the scale added. However, it is common to leave certain notes out. The major 3rd is often omitted because of a strong dissonance with the 11th (4th), therefore called an [[avoid note]]. Omission of the 3rd reduces an 11th chord to the corresponding 9sus4 ([[Suspended chord|suspended]] 9th chord; [[#Reference-idAiken2004|Aikin 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;104). Similarly, omission of the 3rd as well as 5th in C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; results in a major chord with alternate base B{{music|b}}/C, which is characteristic in soul and gospel music. For instance:

*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd = C–(E)–G–B{{music|b}}–D–F ≈ C–F–G–B{{music|b}}–D = C&lt;sup&gt;9sus4&lt;/sup&gt;
*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd and 5th = C–(E)–(G)-B{{music|b}}–D–F ≈ C–F–B{{music|b}}–D = B{{music|b}}/C

If the 9th is omitted, the chord is no longer an extended chord, but an [[added tone chord]] (see below). Without the 3rd, this added tone chord becomes a 7sus4 (suspended 7th chord). For instance:

*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 9th = C&lt;sup&gt;7add11&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–G–B{{music|b}}–(D)–F 
*C&lt;sup&gt;7add11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd = C–(E)–G–B{{music|b}}–(D)-F ≈ C–F–G–B{{music|b}} = C&lt;sup&gt;7sus4&lt;/sup&gt; NB - to properly use the term "sus4", the 4 (in this example the "F"), must have been played in the previous chord so that it can be suspended as a dissonant note into the new chord

Alterations from the natural diatonic chords can be specified as C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt; ... etc. Omission of the 5th in a '''sharpened''' 11th chord reduces its sound to a flat-fifth chord. ([[#Reference-idAiken2004|Aiken 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;94):

C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–(G)–B{{music|b}}–D–F{{music|#}} ≈ C–E–G{{Music|b}}–B{{music|b}}–D = C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;

=== 13ths ===
These are theoretically 11th chords with the 13th (or 6th) note in the scale added. In other words, theoretically they are formed by all the seven notes of a diatonic scale at once. Again, it is common to leave certain notes out. After the 5th, the most commonly omitted note is the troublesome 11th (4th). The 9th (2nd) can also be omitted. A very common voicing on guitar for a 13th chord is just the root, 3rd, 7th and 13th (or 6th). For example:
C–E–(G)-B{{music|b}}–(D)–(F)-A, or C–E–(G)–A–B{{music|b}}–(D)–(F). On the piano, this is usually voiced C–B{{music|flat}}–E–A.

== Added tone chords ==
{{Main|Added tone chord}}
An important characteristic of jazz and blues is the extensive use of [[Seventh chord]]s. In jazz, any chord indicated in a chord chart or fakebook may be interpreted with an added seventh, according to the discretion and musical instincts of the chord-playing musicians. For example, for a jazz song in the key of C, if the opening chord indicates "C" or "C Major", a jazz guitarist accompanying the singer may add the major seventh. For jazz-style blues progressions, any major chords may be played as dominant seventh chords. For example, a jazz musician who sees the turnaround I VI/ii V written as C A/d min G in a fakebook typically interprets this as C7 A7/d min7 G7. This interpretation means that a composer who wants a jazz comping musician to play a simple triad (for artistic reasons or effect) usually must be explicit in the lead sheet or part. For example, if a song in the key of C has a chord labelled "G", a composer who wants a simple triad  (the notes G, B, and D) may write G (triad only) or G (no 7).

The combination of 9th (2nd), 11th (4th) and 13th (6th) notes with 7ths in a chord give jazz chord voicings their distinctive sound. However the use of these notes is not exclusive to the jazz genre; in fact they are very commonly used in folk, classical and popular music generally. Without the 7th, these chords lose their jazzy feel, but can still be very complex. These chords are called [[added tone chords]] because they are basic triads with notes added. They can be described as having a more open sound than extended chords.

In blues, when chords are written without additional notation requesting sevenths, the chords are often played as dominant seventh chords. For example, in the progression C/F/C/C/F/F/C/C/G/F/C/G, a simple version of the 12 bar blues, chord-playing musicians often play all of these chords as dominant seventh chords (e.g., using the chords C7, F7, and G7).

Notation must provide some way of showing that a chord is an added tone chord as opposed to extended. There are two ways this is shown generally, and it is very common to see both methods on the same score. One way is to simply use the word 'add', for example:
* C&lt;sup&gt;add9&lt;/sup&gt;

The second way is to use 2 instead of 9, implying that it is not a 7th chord for instance:
* C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Note that in this way we potentially get other ways of showing a 9th chord:
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add9&lt;/sup&gt;
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add2&lt;/sup&gt;
* C&lt;sup&gt;7/9&lt;/sup&gt;

Generally however the above is shown as simply C&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies a 7th in the chord. Added tone chord notation is useful with 7th chords to indicate partial extended chords. For example:
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add13&lt;/sup&gt;

This would indicate that the 13th is added to the 7th, but without the 9th and 11th.

The use of 2, 4 and 6 as opposed to 9, 11 and 13 indicates that the chord does not include a 7th unless specifically specified. However, it does not mean that these notes must be played within an octave of the root, nor the extended notes in 7th chords should be played outside of the octave, although it is commonly the case. 6 is particularly common in a [[minor sixth chord]] (also known as minor/major sixth chord, as the 6 refers to a [[major sixth]] interval).

It is possible to have added tone chords with more than one added note. The most commonly encountered of these are [[6/9 chord]]s, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A good rule of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.

Similarly, even numbers such as 8, 10 and 12 can be added. However, these double the main triad, and as such are fairly rare. 10 tends to be the most common; it can be used both in suspended chords and (with an accidental) in major or minor chords to produce a [[blue note|major–minor clash]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|b}}10&lt;/sup&gt; indicating the [[Hendrix chord]] of C–E–G–B{{music|b}}–E{{music|b}}). However, because of [[enharmonic]]s, such chords can more easily, and perhaps more intuitively, be represented by {{music|#}}2 (or {{music|#}}9) for a minor over a major or {{music|b}}4 for a major over a minor. In any other case, an 8, 10 or 12 simply indicates the respective note from the triad doubled up one octave.

== Suspended chords ==
{{Main|Suspended chord}}
A [[suspended chord]] is a triad where a note that does not belong to that chord (and is therefore a dissonant note) was being played in the previous chord and is continued to be played in the new chord. Thus it is said to be "suspended" as a dissonant note in the new chord. The most common example is V7 to I. So in "C", it is G,B,D,F moving to C, E, G but, the F is being suspended from the previous chord thus we have V7 to Isus4. In practice the 3rd (E) is replaced by the 4th (F). This chord, because of its dissonant sound,"desires" to resolve into a normal triad, i.e the F then resolves to the E. Thus we have the progression V7 to Isus4 to I. 

There are many variations to suspensions e.g. suspend the 2nd instead of the fourth or even suspend both (called a double suspension). If the progression starts on a 9th chord, the 6th may also be suspended. Three points to note: Firstly, the number given to the suspended note is as it appears in the new chord, not the previous chord. Thus in C, V7 to Isus4, the suspended note 4 is F, which was 7 in the previous chord. Secondly, if the dissonant note does not appear in the previous chord then there is no note being suspended and that note is simply an added note. Thus in our example if the progress is from V with no 7, and the F appears in I it is not a suspension. It is just V to C4 eg G,B,D to C, F, G.  Thirdly, in our example, the G appears in both chords but as it is consonant (not dissonant) in the new chord, it is not labeled as a suspension.

Suspended chords are notated with the symbols "sus4" or "sus2". Where "sus" is found on its own, the suspended fourth chord is implied. The resolution to a regular triad may not be indicated in the chord notation, but the chord-playing instrumentalists may do the resolution even if it is not notated. 

The resolution is especially appropriate if the written melody resolves from a fourth to a third above the root (e.g., if the chord G sus 4, in the key of C Major, lasts a bar in 4,4, and the melody note resolves from the note "C" for two beats and then the note "B" for two beats, this 4-3 resolution in the melody is often mirrored by chord-playing musicians shifting from G sus 4 to G Major. A composer or songwriter who wants to leave the tension unresolved in the backing band may write "N.C" (no chord) after the G sus 4 chord is sounded for the first two beats. This tells chord-playing musicians not to play any chord. 

The "sus" indication can be combined with any other notation. So for example:

* C&lt;sup&gt;9sus4&lt;/sup&gt;

This chord is an extended 9th chord with the 3rd replaced by the 4th (C-F–G–B{{music|b}}–D). However, the major third can be added ''as a tension'' above the 4th to "colorize" the chord (C-F–G–B{{music|b}}–D–E). A sus4 chord with the added major third (sometimes called a major 10th) can also be [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartally]] voiced as C–F–B{{music|b}}–E.

Sus chords are used extensively in jazz, where entire song sections may be based on sus chords. Sus chords of short duration (half a bar) are common in rock, pop and folk.

== Power "chords" ==
{{Main|Power chord}}
Though [[power chord]]s are not true chords ''per se'', as the term "chord" is generally defined as three or more different notes (pitch classes) sounded simultaneously, and a power chord contains only two pitch classes (the root, the fifth, and often a doubling of the root at the octave), power chords are still expressed using a version of chord notation. Most commonly, power chords (e.g., C–G–C) are expressed using a "5" (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;). Power chords are also referred to as ''fifth chords'', ''indeterminate chords'' or ''neutral chords'' (though the term "neutral chord," when expressed with an n (e.g., Cn), is also used to describe a pair of stacked [[neutral third]]s, e.g., C–E{{music|d}}–G, which requires a [[quarter tone]] or similarly sized microtone; or the mixed third chord), since they are inherently neither major nor minor; generally, a power chord refers to a specific doubled-root, three-note voicing of a fifth chord. 

Power chords played on a heavily [[distortion (music)|distorted]] and loudly amplified [[electric guitar]] are a foundational part of the sound and impact of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hardcore punk]]. Power chords are also used, though less commonly, on other instruments, such as [[Hammond organ]] in a traditional heavy metal genre (e.g., [[Deep Purple]]) or electric bass in heavy metal or [[grunge]]. In hard rock and heavy metal, in some cases where there are rapid chord changes in a lead sheet, these are interpreted as power chords, even if they are not notated in "C5"-style notation. For example, in the following chord progression, "C ///|F///|G///|C B B{{music|b}} A", if a fast tempo was played, many hard rock or heavy metal guitarists would play the "C B Bb A" measure as power chords. In other cases, a rock guitarist may decide to interpret a several bar reiteration of what appears notated on the lead sheet as a major or minor chord (e.g., C Maj or C min) as C5, for the raw, stark effect that a power chord provides.

To represent an extended neutral chord, e.g., a seventh (C–G–B{{music|b}}), the chord is expressed as its corresponding extended chord notation with the addition of the words "no3rd," "no3" or the like. The aforementioned chord, for instance, would be indicated C&lt;sup&gt;7no3&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Chords containing quarter tones ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
While not a common practice, the methods for naming chord names and symbols can be adapted to naming chords that contain [[quarter tones]].

=== Neutral chords ===
Neutral chords are chords built entirely by stacking neutral thirds (the interval between a major and minor third). While the neutral triad can sound like major or minor depending on context, it can also be thought of as a chord quality in its own right. An example of the neutral triad would be C–E{{music|d}}–G where the E{{music|d}} exists halfway between E{{music|b}} and E{{music|natural}}. The neutral triad is quite rare and is more commonly seen as the neutral seventh chord such as C–E{{music|d}}–G–B{{music|d}}. These chords are composed of two fifths being a neutral third apart. The chord symbol can be written with a lowercase "n" or "neut" following the root such as Cn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.  Neutral chords can also be extended to higher degrees such as ninths and elevenths. While there is no universally accepted series of notes for larger neutral chords, it makes sense to consider that higher extensions to the chord would be built in the same manner that the seventh chord is, by a series of neutral thirds.

=== Supermajor and subminor ===
Supermajor chords are major triads that have the third raised a quarter tone higher than normal. Such a triad is arguably either an altered version of a suspended chord or a unique triad in its own right. Subminor chords are minor triads that have the third lowered by a quarter tone. An example of a supermajor triad would be C–E{{music|t}}–G, in which E{{music|t}} exists halfway between E and F. An example of a subminor triad would be C–E{{music|db}}–G in which E{{music|db}} exists halfway between D and E{{music|b}}. Supermajor triads can be written with "sup" or a capital "S" following the root while subminor can be written with "sub", "s" or (by extrapolating and adapting [[metric prefix]]es) the micro symbol (µ, not to be confused with the [[Mu chord|Mu major chord]]). The previous examples would therefore be Csup/CS, and Csub/Cs/Cµ. Because triads such as these rarely appear in musical context, they are considered theoretical.

In addition, sevenths can be theoretically created as well based on keeping the relationship of a chord having two perfect fifths the same. While a C major seventh chord would have a major third and major seventh, Csup&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; would contain a supermajor third (E{{music|t}}) and a supermajor seventh (B{{music|t}}). Csub&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; would contain a subminor third (E{{music|db}}) and a subminor seventh (B{{music|db}}). Arguably, higher extensions could be used as well, producing chord names such as Csup&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; or Csub&lt;sup&gt;13{{music|b}}9&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Half-diminished chords without seventh ===
By extension, standard chord notation allows for the expression of a chord built upon an interval of a minor third and a neutral third; i.e. C–E{{music|b}}–G{{music|d}}. Whereas a [[half-diminished seventh chord]] is achieved by diminishing only one of the two intervals needed to transform a minor seventh chord into a [[diminished seventh chord]], a half-diminished chord without a seventh is thus achieved by only diminishing the fifth note halfway between a minor chord and a diminished chord. It would thus be noted as C{{music|halfdim}}, or more explicitly C{{music|halfdim}}no&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to avoid confusion with a half-diminished seventh chord.

== Inversions ==
{{Main|Inversion (music)#Chords}}
In addition to all of the ways of ''building'' chords (listed above), a chord may be [[Inverted chord|inverted]]. Inverting a chord refers to playing a chord, but with a note other than the root as the lowest note of the chord. Take, for example, the C major and the C dominant seventh chords. Refer to the tables below for a list of inversions.

| C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;
| C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/B{{music|b}}
|}

The notation C/E bass indicates a C major chord, but with an E in the bass. Likewise the notation C/G bass indicates that a C major chord is played with a G in the bass. In a jazz quartet with a bass player, the bass player plays the indicated bass note.

See [[figured bass]] for alternate method of notating specific notes in the bass.

== Hybrid chords ==

=== Upper structures ===
{{Main|Upper structure}}
Those are notated in a similar manner to inversions, except that the bass note is not necessarily a chord tone. Examples:
* C/A{{music|b}} bass (A{{music|b}}–C–E–G), equivalent to A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;M7{{music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;;
* C{{music|#}}/E bass (E–G{{music|#}}–C{{music|#}}–E{{music|#}});
* Am/D bass (D–A–C–E). 

Chord notation in jazz usually leaves a certain amount of freedom to the player as for voicing chords, also adding tensions  (e.g., 9th, 11th, 13th, etc.) at the player's discretion. Therefore, upper structures are most useful when the composer wants musicians to play a specific tension array. Example:

If a composer was starting with the following, simpler chord progression:

:{{music|time|4|4}} E&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | Am&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | E{{music|b}}m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | D{{music|b}} G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | C ||

and wished to add "colour" to, chord substitution and reharmonization could be done using slash chords. By using [[tritone substitution]] and tonic substitute chords (e.g., substituting iii or VI of a tonic chord), the following chord progression could be created:

:{{music|time|4|4}} C{{music|#}}/E bass | C/A bass E{{music|b}}/A bass | D{{music|b}}/E{{music|b}} bass G{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;M7{{music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;/A{{music|b}} bass | E{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;add2&lt;/sup&gt;/D{{music|b}} bass D{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|#}}9&lt;/sup&gt;/G bass| Am&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/C bass ||

These are also commonly referred as "[[slash chord]]s". A slash chord is simply a chord placed on top of a different bass note; for example:
* D/F{{music|#}} bass is a D chord with F{{music|#}} in the bass;
* A/C{{music|#}} bass is an A chord with C{{music|#}} in the bass.
Slash chords generally do not indicate a simple inversion (which is usually left to the chord player's discretion anyway), especially considering that the specified bass note may not be part of the chord to play on top. The bass note may be played instead of or in addition to the chord's usual root note, though the root note, when played, is likely to be played only in a higher octave to avoid "colliding" with the new bass note.

=== Polychords ===
{{Main|Polychord}}
Polychords, as the name suggests, are combinations of two or more chords. The most commonly found form of a polychord is a '''bichord''' (two chords played simultaneously) and is written as follows: {{sfrac|upper chord|lower chord}}, for example: {{sfrac|B|C}} (C–E–G—B–D{{music|#}}–F{{music|#}}). In case a very specific voicing is needed, the individual chords can be written in their desired inversions, for example: {{sfrac|E{{music|b}}m/G{{music|b}}|Cdrop2}} (C–G–E—G{{music|b}}–B{{Music|b}}–E{{music|b}}).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=chord symbols should be devoid of voicing information in common practice.}}

== Other symbols ==

The [[Slash (punctuation)|right slash]] '''/''' or diagonal line written above the staff where chord symbols occur is used to indicate a [[Beat (music)|beat]] during which the most recent chord symbol is understood to continue. It is used to help make uneven harmonic rhythms more readable. For example, if written above a measure of standard time, "C / F G" would mean that the C chord symbol lasts two beats while F and G last one beat each. The slash is separated from the surrounding chord symbols so as not to be confused with the chord-over-a-bass-note notation that also uses a slash. Another example is "C///|F///|G///||A G F G"; in this example, the C Major chord is played for one measure, the F Major chord for one measure, the G Major chord for one measure, and then in the last bar, there is one chord per beat "A G F G". Some fake books extend this slash rhythm notation further by indicating chords that are held as a whole note with a diamond, and indicating unison rhythm section rhythmic figures with the appropriate note heads and stems.

For chord abbreviations, the right slash indicates the bass note if other than the root. It is usually written with the complete chord name, and, after the slash symbol, the desired bass note. For example, the symbol C/G would mean that the chord to play is a C major triad with a G as the bass note, leading to the following notes: G–C–E (commonly known as the 2nd inversion C major triad). Some arrangers use C/G bass, adding the word bass to make the intention clear. With just C/G, a musician might misinterpret this as a [[polychord]] (two chords played simultaneously). In this example, if C/G was intended to be read as a polychord, a pianist would play a C Major chord (the notes C, E and G) and a G Major chord (the notes G, B and D) simultaneously.

[[File:Music-simile.svg|thumb|text-top|frameless|upright=0.7|Alt=Examples of a simile and double simile marks|Simile marks]]A simile mark in the middle of an otherwise empty measure tells the musician to repeat the chord or chords of the preceding measure. When seen with two slashes instead of one it indicates that the previous measure's chords should be repeated for two further measures, called a double simile, and is placed on the measure line between the two empty bars. It simplifies the job of both the music reader (who can quickly scan ahead to the next chord change) and the copyist (who doesn't need to repeat every chord symbol).

The chord notation '''N.C.''' indicates the musician should play no chord. The duration of this symbol follows the same rules as a regular chord symbol. This is used by composers and songwriters to indicate that the chord playing musicians (guitar, keyboard, etc.) and the bass player should stop accompanying for the length covered by the "No Chord" symbol. Often the "No Chord" symbol is used to enable a solo singer or solo instrumentalist to play a pickup to a new section or an interlude without accompaniment. 

The stopping of the accompaniment creates a contrast for the listener. It can also enable the songwriter to do a modulation to a new key during the "No Chord" period, as the lack of chords and bassline can free the composer to shift to a different key. If the composer did not write "No Chord", the chord-playing instrumentalists and the bassist might think that the last indicated chord should be continued, as one of the conventions of lead sheet writing is that if the same chord (often the tonic or "I" chord) is repeated for a number of measures, the arranger does not have to keep writing "C Major" in every bar.

An even more stringent indication for the band to tacet (stop playing) is the marking ''solo break''. In jazz and popular music, this indicates that the entire band, including the drummer and percussionist, should stop playing to allow a solo instrumentalist to play a short [[cadenza]], often one or two bars long. This rhythm section tacet creates a change of texture and gives the soloist great rhythmic freedom to speed up, slow down, or play with a varied tempo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">'''Dialogical analysis''', or more precisely '''dialogical interaction analysis''', refers to a way of analyzing human communication which is based on the theory of [[dialogism]]. The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Bakhtin]].

==Overview==
[[Dialogism]] makes several assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.com/books?id=8ir3M0yOjGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Linell, 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio-historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other.

Dialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed &amp;ndash; why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance?

Although dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]] because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see [[dialogical self]]), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ut1yKKJGxVIC&amp;printsec=frontcover Markova &amp; Gillespie, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the production of knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WYNFT16NpMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover Jovchelovitch, 2008])&lt;/ref&gt; and relations between groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;([https://gcal.academia.edu/documents/0010/3091/Cornish___Ghosh_2007_Necessary_contradictions_of_community_led_health_promotion.pdf Cornish, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis&lt;ref&gt;([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex_Gillespie2/publication/261882642_Sensitizing_Questions_A_Method_to_Facilitate_Analyzing_the_Meaning_of_an_Utterance/links/55a4c32a08ae81aec913096a.pdf?origin=publication_list. "Gillespie &amp; Cornish, 2014"])&lt;/ref&gt; and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.&lt;ref&gt;([http://qrj.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/11/10/1468794114557991.full.pdf+html "Aveling, Gillespie &amp; Cornish 2015"])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood''' ('''DAD''') according to the [[International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-10]]), is defined as:

:"A particular pattern of abnormal social functioning that arises during the first five years of life and that tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances, e.g. diffuse, nonselectively focused attachment behaviour, [[attention-seeking]] and indiscriminately friendly behaviour, poorly modulated peer interactions; depending on circumstances there may also be associated emotional or behavioural disturbance." – [http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf90.htm+f942 F94.2] of the ICD-10.

Disinhibited attachment disorder is a subtype of the ICD-10 category F94, "Disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood and adolescence". The other subtype of F94 is [[reactive attachment disorder]] of childhood (RAD – F94 .1).

Synonymous or similar disorders include [[Affectionless psychopathy]] and [[Institutional syndrome]].

Within the ICD-10 category scheme, disinhibited attachment disorder specifically excludes [[Asperger syndrome]] (F84.5), hospitalism in children (F43.2), and [[hyperkinetic disorder]]s (F90.-).

==Comparison with the DSM-IV==
The [[DSM-IV]] distinguishes two categories of RAD: an inhibited subtype and a disinhibited subtype (in the DSM it is listed as 313.89 under infant diagnoses). The ICD-10 describes the former, emotionally withdrawn subtype as RAD and the latter subtype as Disinhibited Attachment Disorder (DAD) (Zeanah ''et al.'', 2004).

Generally, the DSM-IV criteria for the inhibited subtype of RAD were generated by studies done on children who were maltreated or abused. Criteria for the DSM-IV disinhibited subtype of RAD were based on research on children raised in institutions (Zeanah, 1996). This is largely based on the fact that inhibited subtype of RAD is more prevalent in maltreated children, and the disinhibited subtype of RAD is more prevalent in children raised in institutions (Zeanah, 2000).

==Studies==
In a study by Zeanah, (Zeanah ''et al.'', 2004) on reactive attachment disorder in maltreated toddlers, the criteria for DSM-IV ''disinhibited'' RAD (i.e. disinhibited attachment disorder) were:

# not having a discriminated, preferred attachment figure, 
# not checking back after venturing away from the caregiver, 
# lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, 
# a willingness to go off with relative strangers.

For comparison, the criteria for DSM-IV ''inhibited'' RAD were:

# absence of a discriminated, preferred adult,
# lack of comfort seeking for distress,
# failure to respond to comfort when offered,
# lack of social and emotional reciprocity, and
# emotion regulation difficulties.

The authors found that these two disorders were not completely independent; a few children may exhibit symptoms of both types of the disorder.

Their discovery by Galileo Galilei supported one bundle of hypotheses concerning the nature of the Solar System, which the papal authorities denied in favour of a different bundle.]]
[[File:Galileantelescope 2.png|thumb|The geometrical optic functioning of the Galilean telescope does not lend itself to the creation of fictitious images. The following illustrations by Galileo accordingly refute one of the two alternative bundles of hypotheses]]

[[File:Sidereus Nuncius sickle moon.jpg|thumb|Galileo's sketch of mountains on the sickle moon, as published in Sidereus Nuncius ]]
The '''Duhem–Quine thesis''', also called the '''Duhem–Quine problem''', after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], is that it is impossible to test a [[scientific hypothesis]] in isolation, because an [[empirical method|empirical]] test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions (also called ''auxiliary assumptions'' or ''auxiliary hypotheses''). In recent decades the set of associated assumptions supporting a thesis sometimes is called a ''bundle of hypotheses''.

==The substance of the thesis==
The Duhem–Quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Duhem-Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct; for example, that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate. For instance, as evidence against the idea that the [[Earth]] is in motion, some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. Later theories of physics and astronomy, such as [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[relativistic mechanics]] could account for such observations without positing a fixed Earth, and in due course they replaced the static-Earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions.

Although a bundle of hypotheses (i.e. a hypothesis and its background assumptions) ''as a whole'' can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test, the Duhem–Quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle.  One solution to the dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept the background assumptions as true (e.g. explanatory scientific theories together with their respective supporting evidence) we will have rational—albeit nonconclusive—reasons for thinking that the theory under test probably is wrong in at least one respect if the empirical test fails.

==Example from Galilean astronomy== 
The pioneering work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the application of the [[telescope]] to astronomical observation met with rejection from influential sceptics. They denied the truth of his most startling reports, such as that there were [[Galileo Galilei|mountains on the moon]] and [[satellite]]s around Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, Galileo. Sidereus nuncius. 1610. [https://archive.org/details/Sidereusnuncius00Gali]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular some prominent philosophers, most  notoriously [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], refused to look through the telescope, arguing in effect that the instrument might have introduced [[Artifact (error)|artefacts]] producing illusions of mountains or satellites invisible to the unencumbered eye. To neglect such possibilities amounted to [[underdetermination]] in which argument for optical artefacts could be urged as being of merit equal to arguments for observation of new celestial effects, whether the latter were more parsimonious or not. On a similar principle in modern times a prevalent view is that [[Marcello Truzzi#.22Extraordinary claims.22|extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof]].

In the early 17th century the modern version&lt;ref name="Harding1976"/&gt; of the Duhem–Quine thesis had not been formulated, but commonsense objections to such elaborate and ad hoc implicit auxiliary assumptions certainly could be urged. To begin with, the mechanism of the (Galilean) telescopes had been explained in terms of [[geometrical optics]] and the nature of the objects that they imaged was consistent; for example a distant lake would not resemble a tree when seen through a telescope. The behaviour of telescopes on Earth denied any basis for arguing that they could create systematic artefacts in the sky, such as apparent satellites that behaved in the predictable manner of Jovian moons. Evidence also offered no basis to suggest that they could present yet other, more elaborate artefacts, fundamentally different from the satellites, such as Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination. 

In practice of course, the [[Galileo affair|politics and theology]] of the day trumped common sense, but the nature of the controversy was a clear example of how different bundles of (usually implicit) auxiliary assumptions could support mutually inconsistent hypotheses concerning a single topic. In terms of either version of the Duhem–Quine thesis it therefore is necessary to study the defensibility of the auxiliary assumptions together with the primary hypotheses if one is to select the most viable working hypotheses.

==Pierre Duhem==
As popular as the Duhem–Quine thesis may be in [[philosophy of science]], in reality [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] stated very different theses.  Duhem believed that ''only in the field of [[physics]]'' can a single individual hypothesis not be isolated for testing.  He says in no uncertain terms that experimental theory in physics is not the same as in fields like [[physiology]] and certain branches of [[chemistry]]. Also, Duhem's conception of "theoretical group" has its limits, since he states that not all concepts are connected to each other logically. He did not include at all ''a priori'' disciplines such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] within the theoretical groups in physics, since they cannot be tested.

== Willard Van Orman Quine ==
{{See also|Confirmation holism}}
Quine, on the other hand, in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", presents a much stronger version of [[underdetermination]] in science.  His theoretical group embraces ''all'' of human knowledge, including mathematics and logic. He contemplated the entirety of human knowledge as being one unit of empirical significance.   Hence all our knowledge, for Quine, would be [[epistemological]]ly no different from [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Greek gods]], which were posited in order to account for experience.

Quine even believed that logic and mathematics can also be revised in light of experience, and presented [[quantum logic]] as evidence for this.  Years later he retracted this position; in his book ''Philosophy of Logic'', he said that to revise logic would be essentially "changing the subject". In classic logic, connectives are defined according to [[truth value]]s. The connectives in a multi-valued logic, however, have a different meaning than those of classic logic. As for [[quantum]] logic, it is not even a logic based on truth values, so the logical connectives lose the original meaning of classic logic. Quine also notes that [[deviant logic]]s usually lack the simplicity of classic logic, and are not so fruitful.

{{more footnotes|date=April 2008}}

'''Ecophagy''' is a term coined by [[Robert Freitas]] that means the literal consumption of an [[ecosystem]]. It derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "οικος" (oikos) or  [[Late Latin]] "oeco-", which refers to a "house" or "household", and the Greek "φᾰγεῖν" (phagein), "to eat".

Freitas used the term to describe a scenario involving [[molecular nanotechnology]] gone awry. In this situation (called the [[grey goo]] scenario) out-of-control [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating nanorobots]] consume entire ecosystems, resulting in global ecophagy.&lt;br/&gt;
However, the word "ecophagy" is now applied more generally in reference to any event{{dubious|date=April 2012}}—nuclear war, the spread of [[monoculture]], massive species extinctions—that might fundamentally alter the planet. Scholars suggest that these events might result in [[ecological collapse|ecocide]] in that they would undermine the capacity of the Earth's biological population to repair itself. Others suggest that more mundane and less spectacular events—the [[human overpopulation|unrelenting growth of the human population]], the steady transformation of the natural world by human beings—will eventually result in a planet that is considerably less vibrant, and one that is, apart from humans, essentially lifeless. These people believe that the current human trajectory puts us on a path that will eventually lead to ecophagy.
In the paper in which Freitas coined the term he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Freitas]], (2000) ''Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular nanotechnology is the risk that self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment (e.g., "biomass") into replicas of themselves (e.g., "nanomass") on a global basis, a scenario usually referred to as the "grey goo problem" but perhaps more properly termed "global ecophagy".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Semiotics}}

'''Ethnosemiotics''' is a disciplinary perspective which links [[semiotics]] concepts to [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods.

==Definition==
[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] and Joseph Courtés defined for the first time ethnosemiotics in ''[[Semiotics]] and language: an analytical dictionary''.

"Ethno-semiotics is not truly an autonomous semiotics. If it were, it would be in competition with a field of knowledge already established under the name of ethnology or anthropology, whose contribution to the advent of semiotics itself is considerable. Rather, it is a privileged area of curiosities and of methodological exercises ... . 
Given that general semiotics authorizes the treatment of non-linguistic (gestual, somatic, etc.) syntagmatic concatenations as discourses or texts, the field of ethno-linguistics can be enlarged to become an ethno-semiotics; analyses, still rare, of rituals and ceremonies lead us to suppose that ethnology can become, once again, the privileged locus for the construction of general models of signifying behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Algirdas Julien Greimas, Joseph Courtés Semiotics and language: an analytical dictionary Indiana University Press, 1982 - 409 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, in Italy, the interest toward the discipline has been renewed thanks to the studies and the researches of Maurizio del Ninno, Tarcisio Lancioni, and Francesco Marsciani. Under the direction of Francesco Marsciani, in Bologna in 2007 the Ethnosemiotic Centre of the Bologna University (CUBE) was founded, active in different fields of inquiry. In 2015, CUBE's experience led to the series Quaderni di Etnosemiotica and the Ethnosemiotics lab.

==Focus and fields of inquiry==
The ethnosemiologist analyses the systems of signifiers which are individuated in specific cultural contexts through the observation and the application of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]]. At the present, the principal researchers which have been realized are focused on urban spaces, therapy, rituals, folklore, everyday practices. 
In Italy we can distinguish two approaches to ethnosemiotics:

* the Urbin school, founded by Maurizio del Ninno, which follows the theoretical framework of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Georges Dumézil]], close to French [[Social Anthropology]].
* the Bologna-Siena school, founded by Tarcisio Lancioni and Francesco Marsciani, which were concerned by the development of a set of concepts and methods to apply semiotic analysis to different aspects of everyday life.

From 2015 the Ethnosemiotics Lab leads researches both in the theoretical and the methodological field. Developed inside CUBE, active at the Bologna University, it conducts multidisciplinary researches. The synergy between ethnographic observation and the analysis of the manifested values offers active results from the point of view of the capacity to describe social phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7623">The '''Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre''' (Gender Centre) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that strives to address the issues of gender inequality in [[Ghana]].  Based in [[Accra]], Ghana, the Gender Centre has conducted studies on issues ranging from sexual and psychological violence against school girls to the ways in which social norms lead women to have a higher risk of HIV infection than men. The Centre works with local, national, and international organizations in its work towards addressing the problems facing women in Ghanaian society. The Gender Centre conducts research to provide both quantitative and qualitative data that will lead to new laws, fresh outlooks, and community discussions concerning women in this region of the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Dorcas Coker-Appiah]] is the executive director of the Gender Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gendercentreghana.org/?page_id=696|title=Staff|author=|date=|website=gendercentreghana.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanfeministforum.com/the-2nd-ghana-feminist-forum-a-personal-perspective/|title=The 2nd Ghana Feminist Forum: A Personal Perspective - African Feminist Forum|author=|date=29 August 2011|website=africanfeministforum.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre was founded in 1995. Since that time it has conducted numerous studies and published its findings in two books, ''Violence Against Women &amp; Children In Ghana'' and ''Gender Norms, Violence Against Women, HIV/AIDS, a Case Study In Ghana.''&lt;ref&gt;Both works can be purchased through the Gender Centre by contacting them through their website [http://www.gendercentreghana.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

The Gender Centre publishes its research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercentreghana.org|title=Gender Studies &amp; Human Right Documentation Centre|author=|date=|website=www.gendercentreghana.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as manuals, a semiannual newsletter, and an annual report, for other organizations and individuals to use in striving to combat women's inequality.

===Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project===
The Gender Centre successfully conducted the Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=1 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 1998 and continues today. The project aims to abolish [[violence against women]] through conducting community-based research and pursuing a grassroots approach in which meetings with traditional leaders, religious leaders, and community members lead to local teams responsible for raising awareness, dealing with domestic violence crises, and counseling women who have been victims of violence. The project initially began with 3 communities and expanded in 2005 to include a total of 18 communities around Ghana.

===Safe Schools Project===
The Safe Schools Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=2 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) endeavors to address the pressing issue of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of schoolgirls in Ghana. Over the course of two years the Gender Centre trained 120 counselors from thirty communities in the Central Region of Ghana to provide effective counseling to victimized school girls and to prevent further abuse by teachers and peers.

===Ghanaian Women and HIV/AIDS===
The Gender Centre's most recent work concerns women's susceptibility to contracting [[HIV]] due to certain social norms and gender roles that exist in Ghanaian society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=6 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For this qualitative research project, interviewers were trained to ask probing questions and used tape recorders in order to encourage conversation flow with the anonymous interviewees. The final report, published by the Gender Centre, is meant to complement empirical evidence already existing about the rate of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[West Africa]]. The Ghanaian government has adopted the popular ABCs of HIV prevention ([[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]]), but the research by the Gender Centre shows that gender norms and domestic violence make this approach to combating the spread of HIV somewhat ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender Norms, Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.'' Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Ghana are traditionally sexually submissive, meaning that they are not always able to deny their male partners sex or insist on condom use. Men, on the other hand, are often free to take multiple sexual partners and even multiple wives. The practice of wife inheritance in which a widow will marry her deceased husband's relative can promote the spread of HIV as well, since the woman may have the virus herself or can contract it from her new husband's other wives or partners. Additionally, the social stigmatization faced by women already infected discourages them from revealing their positive status, putting others at risk for contracting the disease. After this initial research, the Gender Centre has been conducting meetings and workshops to raise awareness about how such social norms are putting women at a higher risk for contracting HIV. The Center endeavors to reverse these detrimental gender norms by holding support meetings in major cities all over the country and by running a series of radio shows about women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS conducted in the local languages of Twi, Ewe, and Wale, as well as English.

==Collaborations==

The Gender Centre has collaborated with other organizations and agencies as it works to promote awareness about the issues facing women in Ghana today. The Centre has most recently worked with the [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), Rural Watch, [[Academy for Educational Development]] (AED),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aed.org/ Retrieved 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bawku East Women's Development Association (BEWDA), The Centre for the Development for People (CEDEP),&lt;ref&gt;http://cedepghana.tripod.com/ Retrieved 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Amasachina Self Help Association, and the General Agricultural Workers Union (GAWU) of the Ghana Trades Union Congress (TUC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanatuc.org/organisations.php Retrieved 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Gender Centre has published three works of research and analysis, ''Breaking the Silence &amp; Challenging the Myths of Violence Against Women &amp; Children in Ghana: Report of a National Study on Violence'' edited by Dorcas Coker-Appiah and Kathy Cusack, ''Gender Norms, Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS'', and its most recent work, officially launched on 4 May 2010, ''The Architecture for Violence Against Women in Ghana'' edited by Kathy Cusack and Takyiwaa Manuh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercentreghana.org/contactus.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gibbs Society of Biological Thermodynamics''' is composed of scientists involved in the field of [[Biophysics]], with the group meeting annually in the Fall. Recent meetings have been held at the Touch of Nature Conference Center in [[Carbondale, Illinois]].
Current incarnations have begun with a meet and greet on Saturday night, followed by two and a half days of lectures and two nights of poster sessions. Poster sessions often end with several attendees creating a bonfire at a nearby beach. The last night of the meeting is known for its food, a selection of beef cooked over an open flame, with attendees affectionately calling it the "Buffalo Tro".

The 24th annual meeting of the Gibbs Society of Biological Thermodynamics will be held from September 25-28, 2010. The Keynote speaker is C. Nick Pace, [[Texas A&amp;M University]].

In 2009, the Gary K. Ackers Lecture in Biothermodynamics was instituted, with Michael Brenowitz giving the inaugural lecture.  [[Tim Lohman]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], will be giving the Ackers lecture at the 2010 meeting.

[[File:Green Bridge System.JPG|thumb|Green bridge system]]
'''Green bridges''' are an [[Ecotechnology|ecotechnological]] [[In_situ#Environmental_engineering|in-situ]] horizontal filtration system. Their different physical and biological filters work in combination to remove suspended and dissolved impurities of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 7|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green bridge filters help in reducing the suspended solids by filtration process, reducing [[Chemical oxygen demand|Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)]]/[[Biochemical oxygen demand|Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)]] by aerobic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sayali|first=Joshi|title=Ecotechnological Applications for control of lake pollution|url=http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/data/ilec/wlc12/F%20-%20Eutrophication%20and%20its%20Control/F-12.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Bridges also help in the restoration of ecological food chain.

== Development ==
Natural streams, rivers and lakes have their own in-built purification system which consists of natural slopes, stones for biological growth and complex [[food web]] help in the purification process. This food web is nothing but utilization of one's waste by another as its own food. Nature has her own living machinery of detritivorous microbes and other living species to consume wastes. These principles have been harnessed in the treatment of polluted streams.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Green bridges are developed using fibrous material with stones. All the floatable and suspended solids are trapped in this biological bridge and the turbidity of flowing water is reduced. Green plants on the bridges increase the DO level in water, which in turn facilitates the growth of aerobic organisms, which degrade organic pollutants. Sandeep Joshi, director, SERI (Shrishti Eco-Research Institute) has developed this technology and has received a patent for it.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Benefits ==
* Capital expenditure is comparable with the annual operational cost of conventional bioremediation systems.
* Can be developed and operated in combination with conventional systems to improve the performance of the latter.
* Reduce the ecotoxicity of the man-made substances released into the water bodies and facilitate the eco-assimilation of those pollutants into the ecological cycles thus reducing the quantum of hazardous residues to zero which otherwise require costly secured landfill and incineration techniques.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Expected results===
* Solids control : 40–80% reduction
* Pollution control : COD/BOD reduction – 40–90%
* Fecal coliforms control : 50–100% reduction
* Ecotoxicity : Nil
* Dissolved oxygen : Increased by 150% – 1200%
* Aquatic species : 
** Increase in plants/plankton – 200%
** Increase in micro-invertebrates – 200%

Other than the changes in the water quality mentioned above a multifold change in population of avifauna, terrestrial plants along the riverbanks has been noticed. There is an overall odour and mosquito reduction and improvement of river aesthetics. Increase in health status of aquatic life in lentic-lotic system by reduction in ecotoxicity of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kodarkar|first=Mohan|title=Ecological Restoration of Highly Polluted Stretch of Ahar River, Udaipur &amp; Ecological Improvement of Udaisagar Lake, Rajasthan, India, p. 12|url=http://rcse.edu.shiga-u.ac.jp/gov-pro/plan/2010list/10/indian_lakes/ilbm_impact_story-udaipur%27s_ecological_restoration_of_ahar_river_using_green_bridge_technology__2_.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High availability''' is a characteristic of a system, which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually [[uptime]], for a higher than normal period.

Modernization has resulted in an increased reliance on these systems.  For example, hospitals and data centers require high availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. [[Availability]] refers to the ability of the user community to obtain a service or good, access the system, whether to submit new work, update or alter existing work, or collect the results of previous work. If a user cannot access the system, it is – from the users point of view – ''unavailable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Floyd Piedad, Michael Hawkins|title=High Availability: Design, Techniques, and Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHB0HdQ98qYC&amp;dq=high+availability+floyd+piedad+book&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gs0LSrLvBKjm6gOT3ISPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7|isbn=9780130962881|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the term ''[[downtime]]'' is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.

==Principles==
There are three principles of [[systems design]] in [[reliability engineering]] which can help achieve high availability.

# Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding redundancy to the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system.
# Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure.  Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover.
# Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must.

==Scheduled and unscheduled downtime==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
A distinction can be made between scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Typically, scheduled downtime is a result of maintenance that is disruptive to system operation and usually cannot be avoided with a currently installed system design. Scheduled downtime events might include patches to [[system software]] that require a [[booting|reboot]] or system configuration changes that only take effect upon a reboot. In general, scheduled downtime is usually the result of some logical, management-initiated event. Unscheduled downtime events typically arise from some physical event, such as a hardware or software failure or environmental anomaly. Examples of unscheduled downtime events include power outages, failed [[CPU]] or [[RAM]] components (or possibly other failed hardware components), an over-temperature related shutdown, logically or physically severed network connections, security breaches, or various [[Application software|application]], [[middleware]], and [[operating system]] failures.

If users can be warned away from scheduled downtimes, then the distinction is useful.  But if the
requirement is for true high availability, then downtime is downtime whether or not it is scheduled.

Many computing sites exclude scheduled downtime from availability calculations, assuming that it has little or no impact upon the computing user community. By doing this, they can claim to have phenomenally high availability, which might give the illusion of [[continuous availability]]. Systems that exhibit truly continuous availability are comparatively rare and higher priced, and most have carefully implemented specialty designs that eliminate any [[single point of failure]] and allow online hardware, network, operating system, middleware, and application upgrades, patches, and replacements. For certain systems, scheduled downtime does not matter, for example system downtime at an office building after everybody has gone home for the night.

==Percentage calculation==
Availability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year. The following table shows the downtime that will be allowed for a particular percentage of availability, presuming that the system is required to operate continuously. [[Service level agreement]]s often refer to monthly downtime or availability in order to calculate service credits to match monthly billing cycles. The following table shows the translation from a given availability percentage to the corresponding amount of time a system would be unavailable.

[[Uptime]] and [[availability]] can be used synonymously as long as the items being discussed are kept consistent.  That is, a system can be up, but its services are not available, as in the case of a [[network outage]].  This can also be viewed as a system that is available to be worked on, but its services are not up from a functional perspective (as opposed to software service/process perspective). The perspective is important here - whether the item being discussed is the server hardware, server OS, functional service, software service/process...etc.  Keep the perspective consistent throughout a discussion, then uptime and availability can be used synonymously.

==="Nines"===
{{see also|List of unusual units of measurement#Nines}}
Percentages of a particular order of magnitude are sometimes referred to by the [[List of unusual units of measurement#Nines|number of nines]] or "class of nines" in the digits.  For example, electricity that is delivered without interruptions ([[Power outage|blackout]]s, [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]s or [[Voltage spike|surge]]s) 99.999% of the time would have 5 nines reliability, or class five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~walker/classes/aos.s00/lectures/L25.ps Lecture Notes] M. Nesterenko, Kent State University&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the term is used in connection with [[mainframes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/cocchi/CIS345/LargeComputing/05_Availability.ppt Introduction to the new mainframe: Large scale commercial computing Chapter 5 Availability] IBM (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPcM5UePTY0 IBM zEnterprise EC12 Business Value Video] at ''youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt; or enterprise computing, often as part of a [[service-level agreement]].

Similarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then "five", so 99.95% is "three nines five", abbreviated 3N5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Precious metals, Volume 4|last=|first=|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1981|isbn=9780080253695|location=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22four+nines+five%22 page 262]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}&lt;!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually referred to as "three and a half nines",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems |first1=Niall Richard |last1=Murphy |first2=Betsy |last2=Beyer |first3=Jennifer |last3=Petoff |first4=Chris |last4=Jones |year=2016 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4rPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22three+and+a+half+nines%22 38]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is incorrect: a 5 is only a factor of 2, while a 9 is a factor of 10, so a 5 is 0.3 nines (per below formula: &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} 2 \approx 0.3&lt;/math&gt;):{{efn|See [[Mathematical coincidence#Concerning base 2|mathematical coincidences concerning base 2]] for details on this approximation.}} 99.95% availability is 3.3 nines, not 3.5 nines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshdeprez.com/post/67-nines-of-availability/ |title=Nines of Nines |author=Josh Deprez |date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, going from 99.9% availability to 99.95% availability is a factor of 2 (0.1% to 0.05% unavailability), but going from 99.95% to 99.99% availability is a factor of 5 (0.05% to 0.01% unavailability), over twice as much.{{efn|"Twice as much" on a logarithmic scale, meaning two ''factors'' of 2: &lt;math&gt;\times 2 \times 2 &lt; \times 5&lt;/math&gt;}}

A formulation of the ''class of 9s''  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  based on a system's [[unavailability]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be

:&lt;math&gt; c := \lfloor  - \log_{10} x  \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

(cf. [[Floor and ceiling functions]]).

A [[Nine (purity)|similar measurement]] is sometimes used to describe the purity of substances.

In general, the number of nines is not often used by a network engineer when modeling and measuring availability because it is hard to apply in formula. More often, the unavailability expressed as a [[probability]] (like 0.00001), or a [[downtime]] per year is quoted. Availability specified as a number of nines is often seen in [[marketing]] documents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The use of the "nines" has been called into question, since it does not appropriately reflect that the impact of unavailability varies with its time of occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid5_gci921823,00.html Evan L. Marcus, ''The myth of the nines'']&lt;/ref&gt; For large amounts of 9s, the "unavailability" index (measure of downtime rather than uptime) is easier to handle. For example, this is why an "unavailability" rather than availability metric is used in hard disk or data link [[bit error rate]]s.

==Measurement and interpretation==

Availability measurement is subject to some degree of interpretation. A system that has been up for 365 days in a non-leap year might have been eclipsed by a network failure that lasted for 9 hours during a peak usage period; the user community will see the system as unavailable, whereas the system administrator will claim 100% [[uptime]]. However, given the true definition of availability, the system will be approximately 99.9% available, or three nines (8751 hours of available time out of 8760 hours per non-leap year). Also, systems experiencing performance problems are often deemed partially or entirely unavailable by users, even when the systems are continuing to function. Similarly, unavailability of select application functions might go unnoticed by administrators yet be devastating to users&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; a true availability measure is holistic.

Availability must be measured to be determined, ideally with comprehensive monitoring tools ("instrumentation") that are themselves highly available. If there is a lack of instrumentation, systems supporting high volume transaction processing throughout the day and night, such as credit card processing systems or telephone switches, are often inherently better monitored, at least by the users themselves, than systems which experience periodic lulls in demand.

An alternative metric is [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF).

==Closely related concepts==
Recovery time (or estimated time of repair (ETR), also known as [[recovery time objective]] (RTO) is closely related to availability, that is the total time required for a planned outage or the time required to fully recover from an unplanned outage. Another metric is [[mean time to recovery]] (MTTR).  Recovery time could be infinite with certain system designs and failures, i.e. full recovery is impossible. One such example is a fire or flood that destroys a data center and its systems when there is no secondary [[disaster recovery]] data center.

Another related concept is data availability, that is the degree to which databases and other information storage systems faithfully record and report system transactions. Information management specialists often focus separately on data availability in order to determine acceptable (or actual) data loss with various failure events. Some users can tolerate application service interruptions but cannot tolerate data loss.

A [[service level agreement]] ("SLA") formalizes an organization's availability objectives and requirements.

==System design==
Paradoxically, adding more components to an overall system design can undermine efforts to achieve high availability. That is because complex systems inherently have more potential failure points and are more difficult to implement correctly. While some analysts would put forth the theory that the most highly available systems adhere to a simple architecture (a single, high quality, multi-purpose physical system with comprehensive internal hardware redundancy), this architecture suffers from the requirement that the entire system must be brought down for patching and operating system upgrades. More advanced system designs allow for systems to be patched and upgraded without compromising service availability (see [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[failover]]).

High availability requires less human intervention to restore operation in complex systems; the reason for this being that the most common cause for outages is human error.&lt;ref name=humanerror&gt;{{cite web|date=October 27, 2010|url=http://www.gartner.com/id=1458131|title=Top Seven Considerations for Configuration Management for Virtual and Cloud Infrastructures |publisher=[[Gartner]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]] is used to create systems with high levels of availability (e.g. aircraft flight computers). In this case it is required to have high levels of failure detectability and avoidance of common cause failures. Two kinds of redundancy are passive redundancy and active redundancy.

Passive redundancy is used to achieve high availability by including enough excess capacity in the design to accommodate a performance decline. The simplest example is a boat with two separate engines driving two separate propellers. The boat continues toward its destination despite failure of a single engine or propeller. A more complex example is multiple redundant power generation facilities within a large system involving [[electric power transmission]]. Malfunction of single components is not considered to be a failure unless the resulting performance decline exceeds the specification limits for the entire system.

Active redundancy is used in complex systems to achieve high availability with no performance decline. Multiple items of the same kind are incorporated into a design that includes a method to detect failure and automatically reconfigure the system to bypass failed items using a voting scheme. This is used with complex computing systems that are linked. Internet [[routing]] is derived from early work by Birman and Joseph in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active redundancy may introduce more complex failure modes into a system, such as continuous system reconfiguration due to faulty voting logic.

Zero downtime system design means that modeling and simulation indicates [[mean time between failures]] significantly exceeds the period of time between [[planned maintenance]], [[upgrade]] events, or system lifetime. Zero downtime involves massive redundancy, which is needed for some types of aircraft and for most kinds of [[communications satellite|communications satellites]]. [[Global Positioning System]] is an example of a zero downtime system.

Fault [[instrumentation]] can be used in systems with limited redundancy to achieve high availability. Maintenance actions occur during brief periods of down-time only after a fault indicator activates. Failure is only significant if this occurs during a [[mission critical]] period.

[[Modeling and simulation]] is used to evaluate the theoretical reliability for large systems. The outcome of this kind of model is used to evaluate different design options. A model of the entire system is created, and the model is stressed by removing components. Redundancy simulation involves the N-x criteria. N represents the total number of components in the system. x is the number of components used to stress the system. N-1 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where one component is faulted. N-2 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where two component are faulted simultaneously.

==Reasons for unavailability==
A survey among academic availability experts in 2010 ranked reasons for unavailability of enterprise IT systems. All reasons refer to '''not following best practice''' in each of the following areas (in order of importance):&lt;ref&gt;Ulrik Franke, Pontus Johnson, Johan König, Liv Marcks von Würtemberg: Availability of enterprise IT systems – an expert-based Bayesian model, ''Proc. Fourth International Workshop on Software Quality and Maintainability'' (WSQM 2010), Madrid, [http://www.kth.se/ees/forskning/publikationer/modules/publications_polopoly/reports/2010/IR-EE-ICS_2010_047.pdf?l=en_UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Monitoring of the relevant components
# [[Requirements management|Requirements]] and procurement
# Operations
# Avoidance of network failures
# Avoidance of internal application failures
# Avoidance of external services that fail
# Physical environment
# Network redundancy
# Technical solution of backup
# Process solution of backup
# Physical location
# Infrastructure redundancy
# Storage architecture redundancy

The factors themselves are based on the work of [[Evan Marcus]] and [[Hal Stern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Marcus |first2=H. |last2=Stern |title=Blueprints for high availability |edition=Second |location=Indianapolis, IN |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2003 |isbn=0-471-43026-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs of unavailability==
In a 1998 report from IBM Global Services, unavailable systems were estimated to have cost American businesses $4.54 billion in 1996, due to lost productivity and revenues.&lt;ref&gt;IBM Global Services, ''Improving systems availability'', IBM Global Services, 1998, [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~irl/docs/availabilitytutorial.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

High availability is one of the primary requirements of the control systems in unmanned vehicles&lt;ref&gt;[[Ground Combat Vehicle]]&lt;/ref&gt; and autonomous maritime vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[[ACTUV]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the controlling system becomes unavailable, the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) or ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) would be lost.

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἱστορία|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''historía''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''stær'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169–190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Caliò |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293–306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subfields====
The chief subfields of social history include:
* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789–1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20–21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950–2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857–1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850–1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365–370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">In English-language education, '''History of the English language''' ('''HEL''') is a commonly required class for students in [[English studies]] and [[Education theory|Education]], though in the nineteenth and early twentieth century it was often required of all US college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baugh|first=Albert C.|year=1962|title=Historical Linguistics and the Teacher of English|journal=[[College English]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=106–10|jstor=373743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

Since HEL is often the only linguistics class required of English majors and Education students, it usually includes a basic introduction to linguistic concepts and theories (on phonetics, dialects, language families, etc.) as well as the historical stages of English--[[Old English]], [[Middle English]], [[Early Modern English]], and [[Modern English]].

Among the topics which may be taught in HEL are the following: origin and development of the language; vocabulary and etymology; meaning and expression; the role of reference books and dictionaries; varieties of spoken English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/details.php?id=Q100-38|title=History of the English Language|date=2002–2013|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and place in the curriculum==

The need for HEL, as perceived by college professors and (English) department heads, was found to vary widely in a poll of department heads done in 1952. The poll asked heads to comment on the selection of language courses they'd require an MA candidate who applies for a teaching position to have taken; of 46 heads, 20 marked HEL, more than any other option (including advanced grammar, Old English, Chaucer, etc.). The author of the study noted that at the time no graduate courses in language study were required for the MA programs at many notable institutions, including Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, and Penn State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Donald W|year=1952|title=English Language Studies and the M. A. Program|journal=[[College English]]|volume=14|issue=3|pages=164–66|jstor=372130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional passionate plea is made to promote HEL—J. E. Graves notes in a 1956 article in ''[[College English]]'' that proper courses in HEL are necessary for any future English teacher, and bemoans the perceived shoving aside of "language study in high school with non-rigorous semantics and 'learning situations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graves|first=J. E.|year=1956|title=Training English Teachers|journal=[[College English]]|volume=17|issue=8|jstor=495707}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such plea came in 1961 from [[Albert C. Baugh]], professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania and author of ''A History of the English Language'',&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Ronald G.|year=1936|title=Rev. of Baugh, ''A History of the English Language''|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=72–75|jstor=409029|doi=10.2307/409029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Morton C.|year=1958|title=Rev. of Baugh, ''A History of the English Language''|journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=57|issue=4|page=796|jstor=27707189}}&lt;/ref&gt; who "justified" HEL by arguing that it teaches skills necessary for teachers of literature who often have students read older texts (Baugh cites Shakespeare throughout), including etymology (and the history of word changes), pronunciation and accentuation, and grammar and idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baugh|first=Albert C.|year=1962|title=Historical Linguistics and the Teacher|journal=[[College English]]|volume=24|issue=2|pages=106–10|jstor=373743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, though by no means all, scholars of education suggest the importance of HEL. Marcia Henry, taking the [[Orton-Gillingham]] approach for dyslexic children as a structural starting point, argues that teaching the subject aids students in decoding and spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Marcia K.|year=1998|title=Beyond Phonics: Integrated Decoding and Spelling Instruction Based on Word Origin and Structure|journal=[[Annals of Dyslexia]]|volume=38|pages=258–75|url=http://ld4elementaryliteracy.edublogs.org/files/2008/07/beyondphonics.pdf|doi=10.1007/bf02648260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of English education, a field now often referred to as English Language Arts in which HEL is often required, the position of history of the English language is tenuous: it is not universally acknowledged that elementary and high-school students need to be taught anything about the subject. James Ney, a linguist at Arizona State University, argues that the shift in contemporary linguistics toward [[transformational grammar]] has taken attention away from historical linguistics. Ney's study of high-school textbooks suggested that history of English only takes up a minute amount of coverage; if it is there at all, it pertains to etymology and dictionary usage. Though some curriculum proposals (some of which very ambitious; Ney singles out the 1968 Atlanta Regional Curriculum Project) did promote a more rigorous study of the subject in elementary and high school, no discernible impact seems to have been made on actual school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ney|first=James W.|editor=James Flood|others=Diane Lapp, James R.

A '''holdfast''' is a [[root]]-like structure that anchors [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] organisms, such as [[seaweed]], other sessile [[algae]], stalked [[crinoid]]s, [[Benthic zone|benthic]] [[cnidaria]]ns, and [[sponge]]s, to the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. N. Thomas |year=2002 |title=Seaweeds |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London |isbn=978-0-565-09175-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdfasts vary in shape and form depending on both the species and the substrate type.  The holdfasts of organisms that live in muddy substrates often have complex tangles of root-like growths. These projections are called '''[[wikt:haptera|haptera]]''' and similar structures of the same name are found on [[lichen]]s.  The holdfasts of organisms that live in sandy substrates are bulb-like and very flexible, such as those of [[sea pen]]s, thus permitting the organism to pull the entire body into the substrate when the holdfast is contracted.  The holdfasts of organisms that live on smooth surfaces (such as the surface of a boulder) have flattened bases which adhere to the surface. The organism derives no nutrition from this intimate contact with the substrate, as the process of liberating nutrients from the substrate requires [[enzyme|enzymatically]] eroding the substrate away, thereby increasing the risk of organism falling off the substrate.

The claw-like holdfasts of [[kelp]]s and other algae differ from the roots of [[Embryophyte|land plants]], in that they have no absorbent function, instead serving only as an anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D.1984.

In the context of [[human evolution]], '''human vestigiality''' involves those [[phenotypic trait|traits]] (such as [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or [[behavior]]s) occurring in [[human]]s that have lost all or most of their original [[function (biology)|function]] through [[evolution]]. Although structures called ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial]]'' often appear functionless, a vestigial structure may retain lesser functions or develop minor new ones. In some cases, structures once identified as vestigial simply had an unrecognized function.

The examples of human vestigiality are numerous, including the anatomical (such as the human [[Coccyx|tailbone]], [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], and [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|inside corner of the eye]]), the behavioral ([[goose bumps]] and [[palmar grasp reflex]]), and molecular ([[pseudogene]]s). Many human characteristics are also vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals.

== History ==
[[Charles Darwin]] listed a number of putative human vestigial features, which he termed rudimentary, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' (1890). These included the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also commented on the sporadic nature of many vestigial features, particularly musculature. Making reference to the work of the anatomist [[William Turner (anatomist)|William Turner]], Darwin highlighted a number of sporadic muscles which he identified as vestigial remnants of the [[panniculus carnosus]], particularly the [[sternalis muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C, ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'', London: John Murray, 1890, p.13.[https://archive.org/details/ajp4619.0001.001.umich.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner W, ''On the musculus sternalis'', Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh session 1866–1867, p.65.[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingso618661869roya#page/64/mode/2up/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published [[Robert Wiedersheim#The Structure of Man|''The Structure of Man'']], a book on [[human anatomy]] and its relevance to man's evolutionary history. This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial, or as Wiedersheim himself explained: "Organs having become wholly or in part functionless, some appearing in the Embryo alone, others present during Life constantly or inconstantly. For the greater part Organs which may be rightly termed Vestigial."&lt;ref name="The Structure of Man"&gt;Wiedersheim, R. (1893) ''The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History''. Second Edition. Translated by H. and M. Bernard. London: Macmillan and Co. 1895. [https://archive.org/details/structureofmanin00wiediala]&lt;/ref&gt; His list of supposedly vestigial organs included many of the examples on this page as well as others then mistakenly believed to be purely vestigial, such as the [[pineal gland]], the [[thymus gland]], and the [[pituitary gland]]. Some of these organs that had lost their obvious, original functions later turned out to have retained functions that had gone unrecognized before the discovery of hormones or many of the functions and tissues of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller, G. B. (2002) "Vestigial Organs and Structures." in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 1131–1133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Koerth-Baker | first=Maggie | title=Vestigial Organs Not So Useless After All | date=30 July 2009 | work=National Geographic | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090730-spleen-vestigial-organs.html | accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included:
* the role of the pineal in the regulation of the [[circadian rhythm]] (neither the function nor even the existence of melatonin was yet known);
* discovery of the role of the [[thymus]] in the immune system lay many decades in the future; it remained a mystery organ until after the mid-20th century;
* the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[hypothalamus]] with their many and varied hormones were far from understood, let alone the complexity of their interrelationships.

Historically, there was a trend not only to dismiss the [[vermiform appendix]] as being uselessly vestigial, but an anatomical hazard, a liability to [[Appendicitis|dangerous inflammation]]. As late as the mid-20th century, many reputable authorities conceded it no beneficial function.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF"&gt;Wells, H.g. Huxley, J. Wells, G. P. The Science of Life. Pub. Cassell 1931&lt;/ref&gt; This was a view supported, or perhaps inspired, by Darwin himself in the 1874 edition of his book [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. The organ's patent liability to appendicitis and its poorly understood role left the appendix open to blame for a number of possibly unrelated conditions. For example, in 1916, a surgeon claimed that removal of the appendix had cured several cases of [[Trigeminal neuralgia|trifacial neuralgia]] and other nerve pain about the head and face, even though he stated that the evidence for appendicitis in those patients was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, M. I.: Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 67, Issues 15-26, 1916. Page 1326&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of hormones and hormonal principles, notably by [[Endocrinology|Bayliss and Starling]], argued against these views, but in the early twentieth century, there remained a great deal of fundamental research to be done on the functions of large parts of the digestive tract. In 1916, an author found it necessary to argue against the idea that the colon had no important function and that "...the ultimate disappearance of the appendix is a coordinate action and not necessarily associated with such frequent inflammations as we are witnessing in the human..."&lt;ref&gt;W. Colin MacKenzie. A Contribution to the Biology of the Vermiform Appendix. Medical record, Volume 89 Page 342 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been a long history of doubt about such dismissive views. Around 1920, the prominent surgeon [[Kenelm Hutchinson Digby]] documented previous observations, going back more than thirty years, that suggested lymphatic tissues, such as the tonsils and appendix, may have substantial immunological functions.

[[File:Ileum-Caecum-Colon of rabbit IMG 5771.JPG|thumb|Ileum, caecum and colon of rabbit, showing ''Appendix vermiformis'' on fully functional [[caecum]].]]
[[File:Gray536.png|right|thumb|The human vermiform appendix on the vestigial caecum.]]
In modern humans, the [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions, much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze [[cellulose]] and similar indigestible plant materials.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871). ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Some herbivorous animals, such as rabbits, have a terminal vermiform appendix and [[cecum]] that apparently bear patches of tissue with immune functions and may also be important in maintaining the composition of [[intestinal flora]]. It does not however seem to have much digestive function, if any, and is not present in all herbivores, even those with large caeca.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian | title = Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-61714-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the accompanying pictures however, the human appendix typically is about comparable to that of the rabbit's in size, though the caecum is reduced to a single bulge where the ileum empties into the colon.&lt;ref name="WellsSOF" /&gt; Some carnivorous animals may have appendices too, but seldom have more than vestigial caeca.&lt;ref name="StPRCESD"&gt;Peter Robert Cheeke, Ellen S. Dierenfeld, Comparative Animal Nutrition and Metabolism. Publisher: CABI;  2010 {{ISBN|978-1-84593-631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions, some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion, though that is unlikely to be a novel function, given the presence of vermiform appendices in many herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21153898/|title=Appendix may be useful after all – Health – Health care – More health news – NBC News|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Randal Bollinger |first1=R. |last2=Barbas |first2=Andrew S. |last3=Bush |first3=Errol L. |last4=Lin |first4=Shu S. |last5=Parker |first5=William |title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=249 |issue=4 |pages=826–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17936308 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intestinal bacterial populations entrenched in the appendix may support quick re-establishment of the flora of the large intestine after an illness, poisoning, or after an antibiotic treatment depletes or otherwise causes harmful changes to the bacterial population of the colon.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Q. Choi, "The Appendix: Useful and in Fact Promising", ''Live Science'', 2009, [http://www.livescience.com/10571-appendix-fact-promising.html Appendix has useful function]&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. It is widely present in [[euarchontoglires]] (a superorder of mammals that includes rodents and primates) and has also evolved [[Convergent evolution|independently]] in the [[diprotodont]] [[marsupials]], [[monotreme]]s, and is highly diverse in size and shape which could suggest it is not vestigial. Researchers deduce that the appendix has the ability to protect good bacteria in the gut. That way, when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines, the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep the person healthy.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x |pmid=19678866 |title=Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1984–99 |year=2009 |last1=Smith |first1=H.

The coccyx serves as an attachment site for tendons, ligaments, and muscles. It also functions as an insertion point of some of the muscles of the pelvic floor.
In rare cases, congenital defect results in a [[Tail#Human tails|short tail-like structure]] being present at birth.

=== Wisdom teeth ===
&lt;!--This section also appears in the wisdom teeth article, please try to keep the two in harmony--&gt;
[[Wisdom tooth|Wisdom teeth]] are vestigial third molars that human ancestors used to help in grinding down plant tissue. The common postulation is that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth, which were possibly used to help chew down foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the [[cellulose]] that makes up a plant cell wall. As human diets changed, smaller jaws were [[Natural Selection|naturally selected]], yet the third molars, or "wisdom teeth", still commonly develop in human mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dr. George B.

=== Vomeronasal organ ===
In some animals, the [[vomeronasal organ]] (VNO) is part of a second, completely separate sense of smell, known as the [[Olfaction|accessory olfactory system]]. Many studies have been performed to find if there is an actual presence of a VNO in adult human beings. Trotier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/25.4.369 |pmid=10944499 |title=The Vomeronasal Cavity in Adult Humans |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=369–80 |year=2000 |last1=Trotier |first1=D. |last2=Eloit |first2=C |last3=Wassef |first3=M |last4=Talmain |first4=G |last5=Bensimon |first5=J.

Macalister, Annals and Magazine of Natural History, vol. vii., 1871, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other primates such as the [[orangutan]] and [[chimpanzee]] however have ear [[muscle]]s that are minimally developed and non-functional, yet still large enough to be identifiable.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; A muscle attached to the ear that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, can no longer be said to have any biological function.

The outer structure of the ear also shows some vestigial features, such as the node or point on the helix of the ear known as [[Darwin's tubercle]] which is found in around 10% of the population.

=== Eye ===
The [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|plica semilunaris]] is a small fold of tissue on the inside corner of the eye. It is the vestigial remnant of the [[nictitating membrane]], an organ that is fully functional in some other species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Owen|Owen, R.]] 1866–1868. ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates''. London.{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its associated muscles are also vestigial.&lt;ref name="Descent" /&gt; Only one species of [[primate]], the [[Calabar angwantibo]], is known to have a functioning nictitating membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330250307 |pmid=5971502 |title=The skin of primates.

The [[orbitalis muscle]] is a vestigial or rudimentary nonstriated muscle (smooth muscle) of the eye that crosses from the infraorbital groove and sphenomaxillary fissure and is intimately united with the periosteum of the orbit.

=== Reproductive system ===
{{Main|List of homologues of the human reproductive system}}

==== Genitalia ====
In the [[internal genitalia]] of each human sex, there are some residual organs of [[mesonephric duct|mesonephric]] and [[paramesonephric duct|paramesonephric]] ducts during embryonic development:
* [[Gartner's duct]]
* [[Epoophoron]]
* [[Vesicular appendages of epoophoron]]
* [[Paroophoron]]

Human vestigial structures also include leftover embryological remnants that once served a function during development, such as the belly button, and analogous structures between biological sexes. For example, men are also born with two nipples, which are not known to serve a function compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;"Breast Anatomy and Embryology." Essentials of Plastic Surgery (2015): 355-61&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to genitourinary development, both internal and external genitalia of male and female fetuses have the ability to fully or partially form their analogous [[phenotype]] of the opposite biological sex if exposed to a lack/overabundance of androgens or the SRY gene during fetal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(06)80172-1 |pmid=7965425 |title=True hermaphroditism: Genetic variants and clinical management |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=738–44 |year=1994 |last1=Hadjiathanasiou |first1=C.G. |last2=Brauner |first2=R. |last3=Lortat-Jacob |first3=S. |last4=Nivot |first4=S. |last5=Jaubert |first5=F. |last6=Fellous |first6=M. |last7=Nihoul-Fékété |first7=C. |last8=Rappaport |first8=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4274/jcrpe.2495 |pmid=26761946 |pmc=5096479 |title=Homozygous Ala65Pro Mutation with V89L Polymorphism in SRD5A2 Deficiency |journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=218–23 |year=2016 |last1=Eren |first1=Erdal |last2=Edgünlü |first2=Tuba |last3=Asut |first3=Emre |last4=Karakaş Çelik |first4=Sevim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of vestigial remnants of genitourinary development include the [[hymen]], which is a [[membrane]] that surrounds or partially covers the external [[vagina]]l opening that derives from the sinus tubercle during fetal development and is homologous to the male [[seminal colliculus]].&lt;ref name=Healey2010&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/174_2010_128 |chapter=Embryology of the Female Reproductive Tract |title=Imaging of Gynecological Disorders in Infants and Children |pages=21–30 |series=Medical Radiology |year=2010 |last1=Healey |first1=Andrew |isbn=978-3-540-85601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers{{who|date=January 2013}} have hypothesized that the persistence of the hymen may be to provide temporary protection from [[infection]], as it separates the vaginal lumen from the urogenital sinus cavity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2008.03.009 |pmid=19646660 |title=Hymen Sparing Surgery for Imperforate Hymen: Case Reports and Review of Literature |journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=e61–4 |year=2009 |last1=Basaran |first1=Mustafa |last2=Usal |first2=Deniz |last3=Aydemir |first3=Cumhur }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the [[glans penis]] and the [[clitoris]], the [[labia minora]] and the ventral penis, and the ovarian follicles and the seminiferous tubules.&lt;ref name=Healey2010/&gt;

He wrote, “It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial structure devoid of function... However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when the child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from contact with sodden clothes or napkin.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the physical act of sex, the foreskin reduces friction, which can reduce the need for additional sources of lubrication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Some medical researchers, however, claim [[Circumcision|circumcised]] men enjoy sex just fine and that, in view of recent research on HIV transmission, the foreskin causes more trouble than it’s worth."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The area of the outer forskin measures between 7–100 cm2,&lt;ref&gt;Kigozi G, Wawer M, Ssettuba A, et al. .

The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. London, UK: John Murray; 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2017 publication of the Global Health Journal: Science and Practice, Morris and Krieger wrote, "The variability in foreskin size is consistent with the foreskin being a vestigial structure."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morris BJ, Krieger JN, Klausner JD|date=March 2017|title=CDC's Male Circumcision Recommendations Represent a Key Public Health Measure|url=http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15|journal=Global Health, Science and Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=15–27|doi=10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00390|pmc=5478224|pmid=28351877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin speculated that the sensitivity of the foreskin to fine touch might have served as an “early warning system” in our naked ancestors while it protected the glans from the intrusion of biting insects and parasites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Musculature ===
A number of [[muscles]] in the human body are thought to be vestigial, either by virtue of being greatly reduced in size compared to homologous muscles in other species, by having become principally tendonous, or by being highly variable in their frequency within or between populations.

==== Head ====
The Occipitalis Minor is a muscle in the back of the head which normally joins to the [[auricular muscles]] of the ear. This muscle is very sporadic in frequency—always present in Malays, in 56% of Africans, 50% of Japanese, 36% of Europeans, and is nonexistent in the [[Khoikhoi]] people of southwestern Africa and in [[Melanesia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30079154 |first1=Alexander |last1=Macalister |year=1875 | title =Additional Observations on Muscular Anomalies in Human Anatomy.

The platysma, a quadrangular (four sides) muscle in a sheet-like configuration, is a vestigial remnant of the panniculous carnosus of animals. In horses, it is the muscle that allows it to flick a fly off its back.

==== Face ====
In many non-human mammals, the upper lip and sinus area is associated with [[whiskers]] or vibrissae which serve a sensory function. In humans, these whiskers do not exist but there are still sporadic cases where elements of the associated vibrissal capsular muscles or sinus hair muscles can be found.

The [[palmaris longus muscle]] is seen as a small tendon between the [[flexor carpi radialis]] and the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]], although it is not always present. The muscle is absent in about 14% of the population, however this varies greatly with ethnicity. It is believed that this muscle actively participated in the arboreal locomotion of primates, but currently has no function, because it does not provide more grip strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2014/178906 |pmid=24860810 |pmc=4016873 |title=Morphometric and Statistical Analysis of the Palmaris Longus Muscle in Human and Non-Human Primates |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2014 |pages=1-6 |year=2014 |last1=Aversi-Ferreira |first1=Roqueline A.

The [[levator claviculae muscle]] in the [[posterior triangle of the neck]] is a supernumerary muscle present in only 2–3% of all people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1999 |ref=harv |last=Rubinstein |first= David |last2=Escott |first2=Edward J. |last3=Hendrick |first3=Laura L. |title=The prevalence and CT appearance of the levator claviculae muscle: a normal variant not to be mistaken for an abnormality |journal= AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=583–6 |pmid=10319965 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/reprint/20/4/583.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nearly always present in most mammalian species, including [[gibbon]]s and [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loukas |first=M. |last2=Sullivan |first2=A. |last3=Tubbs |first3=R.S. |last4=Shoja |first4=M.M. |title=Levator claviculae: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Folia Morphol. |year=2008 |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=307–310 |url=http://www.fm.viamedica.pl/zamow_art_pdf.phtml?id=46&amp;indeks_art=781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Torso ====
The [[pyramidalis muscle]] of the abdomen is a small and triangular muscle, anterior to the [[rectus abdominis]], and contained in the [[rectus sheath]]. It is absent in 20% of humans and when absent, the lower end of the rectus then becomes proportionately increased in size. Anatomical studies suggest that the forces generated by the pyramidalis muscles are relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1447-073X.2007.00226.x |pmid=19159363 |pmc=3531545 |title=Architecture and fiber type of the pyramidalis muscle |journal=Anatomical Science International |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=294–7 |year=2008 |last1=Lovering |first1=Richard M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Larry D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] of the back has several sporadic [[Latissimus dorsi muscle#Variations|variations]]. One particular variant is the existence of the dorsoepitrochlearis or latissimocondyloideus muscle which is a muscle passing from the tendon of the latissimus dorsi to the long head of the [[triceps brachii]]. It is notable due to its well developed character in other apes and monkeys, where it is an important climbing muscle, namely the dorsoepitrochlearis brachii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ca.20799 |pmid=19373904 |title=Development and clinical significance of the musculus dorsoepitrochlearis in men |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=481–8 |year=2009 |last1=P. |first1=Haninec |last2=R. |first2=Tomáš |last3=R. |first3=Kaiser |last4=R. |first4=Čihák }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, William E., ''The Musculoskeletal Anatomy of the Thorax and Brachium of an Adult Female Chimpanzee'',6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory, New Mexico, 1965. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/462433.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This muscle is found in ≈5% of humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/MuscularSystem/Text/L/06Latissimus.shtml{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leg ====
The [[plantaris muscle]] is composed of a thin muscle belly and a long thin tendon. The muscle belly is approximately {{convert|5|-|10|cm|inch|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} long, and is absent in 7–10% of the human population. It has some weak functionality in moving the knee and ankle but is generally considered redundant and is often used as a source of tendon for grafts. The long, thin tendon of the plantaris is humorously called "the freshman's nerve", as it is often mistaken for a nerve by first-year medical students.

==== Tongue ====
Another intriguing example of human vestigiality occurs in the tongue, specifically the chondroglossus muscle.  In a morphological study of 100 Japanese cadavers, it was found that 86% of fibers identified were solid and bundled in the appropriate way to facilitate speech and mastication.  The other 14% of fibers were short, thin and sparse – nearly useless, and thus concluded to be of vestigial origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(02)80087-5 |pmid=12392330 |title=Morphological study of the human chondroglossus muscle in Japanese |journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger |volume=184 |issue=5 |pages=493–9 |year=2002 |last1=Ogata |first1=Shigemitsu |last2=Mine |first2=Kazuharu |last3=Tamatsu |first3=Yuichi |last4=Shimada |first4=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breasts ===
[[Supernumerary nipple|Extra nipples]] or [[Accessory breast|breasts]] sometimes appear along the [[Milk line|mammary lines]] of humans, appearing as a remnant to mammalian ancestors who possessed more than two nipples or breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kajava | first1 = Y | year = 1915 | title = The proportions of supernumerary nipples in the Finnish population | url = | journal = Duodecim | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 143–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0971-6866.108051 |pmid=23716953 |pmc=3656534 |title=Seven nipples in a male: World′s second case report |journal=Indian Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=373–5 |year=2012 |last1=Goyal |first1=Tarang |last2=Bakshi |first2=SK |last3=Varshney |first3=Anupam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ==
[[File:Gaensehaut.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Goose bumps]] are an example of a vestigial human reaction to stress.]]
Humans also bear some vestigial behaviors and reflexes.&lt;ref name=Spinney&gt;{{Citation|title=Remnants of evolution |author=Laura Spinney |journal=New Scientist |year=2008 |volume=198 |issue=2656 |pages=42–45 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the formation of [[goose bumps]] in humans under [[stress (medicine)|stress]] is a vestigial [[reflex action|reflex]]; a possible function in human evolutionary ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. (1872) ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' John Murray, London.{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Raising the hair is also used to trap an extra layer of air, keeping an animal warm.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt; Due to the diminished amount of hair in humans, the reflex formation of goose bumps when cold is also vestigial.&lt;ref name=Spinney/&gt;

The [[palmar grasp reflex]] is supported to be a vestigial behavior in human infants. When placing a finger or object to the palm of an infant, it will securely grasp it. This grasp is found to be rather strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology |edition=fifth |author=Peter Gray |year=2007 |page=66 |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-0617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[infant]]s—37% according to a 1932 study—are able to support their own weight from a rod,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzL2Bgvf9Q0C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22chancy+and+mcgraw+(31)+investigated+the+reflex+in+the+125+infants%22%22 Behavior Development in Infants] (via Google Books) by Evelyn Dewey, citing a study "Reflexes and other motor activities in newborn infants: a report of 125 cases as a preliminary study of infant behavior" published in the ''Bull. Neurol. Inst. New York'', 1932, Vol. 2, pp. 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;, although there is no way they can cling to their mother. The grasp is also evident in the feet too. When a baby is sitting down, its prehensile feet assume a curled-in posture, similar to that observed in an adult chimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |author=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |pages=85–86 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archetype: A Natural History of the Self |author=Anthony Stevens |year=1982 |page=87 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0-7100-0980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancestral primate would have had sufficient body hair to which an infant could cling unlike modern humans, thus allowing its mother to escape from danger, such as climbing up a tree in the presence of a predator without having to occupy her hands holding her baby.

It has been proposed that the [[hiccup]] is an evolutionary remnant of earlier [[amphibian]] [[respiratory system|respiration]].&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.10224 |pmid=12539245 |title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for the origin of hiccough |journal=BioEssays |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |year=2003 |last1=Straus |first1=C. |last2=Vasilakos |first2=K. |last3=Wilson |first3=R. J. A. |last4=Oshima |first4=T. |last5=Zelter |first5=M. |last6=Derenne |first6=J-Ph. |last7=Similowski |first7=T. |last8=Whitelaw |first8=W. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibians such as tadpoles gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to mammalian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during fetal development, before the motor pathways that enable normal lung ventilation form. Thus, according to recapitulation theory, the hiccup is evolutionarily antecedent to modern lung respiration. Additionally, they point out that hiccups and amphibian gulping are inhibited by elevated CO{{Sub2}} and may be stopped by [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] agonists, illustrating a possible shared physiology and evolutionary heritage. These proposals may explain why premature infants spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping, possibly gulping like amphibians, as their lungs are not yet fully formed. Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs before 28 weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the [[phrenic nerve]], which primarily controls the thoracic diaphragm. The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation, it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held-over from our amphibious ancestors.
This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for most of this paragraph.

== Molecular ==
{{further|Pseudogene}}
There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], a gene that is functional in most other mammals and produces an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes [[vitamin C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-4165(99)00123-3 |pmid=10572964 |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in l-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |volume=1472 |issue=1–2 |pages=408–11 |year=1999 |last1=Ohta |first1=Yuriko |last2=Nishikimi |first2=Morimitsu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and other members of the suborder [[Haplorrhini]], a mutation disabled the gene and made it unable to produce the enzyme. However, the remains of the gene are still present in the [[human genome]] as a vestigial genetic sequence called a [[pseudogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishikimi M, Fukuyama R, Minoshima S, Shimizu N, Yagi K |title=Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the human nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in man |journal=J.

Via '''deep [[water aeration]]''' or '''[[Hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] aeration''', the [[oxygen]] demand of deep water is covered by oxygen from the atmosphere without destroying the lake’s natural [[Lake stratification|stratification]]. Thus the deep water becomes aerobic, the [[phosphate]] dissolution is reduced significantly and the mineralization of [[sediments]] improves.
Years of scientific evidence show that it is possible to keep the deep water aerobic all year round via technical ventilation measures and thereby to recover the natural balance of lakes effectively.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, C., Bernhardt, H.: Handbuch Angewandte Limnologie – 14. Erg.Lfg. 4/0 Verlag: Hüthig Jehle Rehm, 2002, {{ISBN|3-609-75820-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eutrophication ==
In stratified, eutrophic lakes an oxygen deficit in deep water is created during summer stagnation. As a result of elevated nutrient inputs the trophic level of many lakes increases continuously. Elevated phosphorus concentrations may lead to stronger algae growth and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption in the deep zones. 
In the anaerobic environment of deep water sludge accumulates, while concentrations of [[ammonium]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]] increase in the [[water body]].
The [[hypolimnion]] is now not only hostile, but the [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic conditions]] also cause increased phosphate dissolutions from the sediments into the deep water. These additional nutrient loads create further problems after the next full circulation. 
Particularly in terms of drinking water production in reservoirs and dams with respect to the existing regulations of the Drinking Water Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;Verordnung über die Qualität von Wasser für den menschlichen Gebrauch (Trinkwasserverordnung) vom 21. Mai 2001. Zuletzt geändert durch Art. 3, Abs. 1, 2 vom 5. Dezember 2012. In: BGBl., Teil 1, Nr. 24: 959-969 (2001) und BGBl. I S. 2562 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; these deteriorations in water status are a serious problem. The deep water aeration can prevent this process.

== Technical measures for hypolimnetic aeration ==
TIBEAN or TWBA stands for the German „Tiefenwasserbelüftungsanlage" which means „deep water aeration system". 
The TIBEAN - series are floating or submerse plants. They consist of one or more upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, [[degassed water]] is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented. [[File:TIBEAN Polycon Anlagenkomponenten.jpg|thumbnail|TIBEAN: technical components and functional principal]]

=== Technology ===
At the lower end of the plant atmospheric air is inserted into the water by an [[Injector|ejector]]. A mixture of water and oxygen is forced upwards in the upstream pipe. At the end of the upstream pipe the mixture flows into the degassing chamber. Residual gases are separated from the oxygenated water. The gas escapes into the [[atmosphere]], the oxygenated water flows back through the downstream pipe. The outlet provides a laminar flow and a horizontal outflow into the hypolimnion.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, D.: TIBEAN – a new hypolimnetic water aeration plant. Verb. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 24: 184-187, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klapper, H. 1992"&gt;Klapper, H.: Eutrophierung und Gewässerschutz. Stuttgart, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1992, {{ISBN|978-3-334-00394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thanks to the flow and mass transfer calculations which are performed in the context of the technical configuration, the optimal set-up can be determined.

=== Individual parts ===
# Floating tanks
# Upstream pipe (Telescope) 
# Degassing chamber
# Mixing device
# Suction fence 
# Covering fence
# Downstream pipe
# Oxygen input
# Submersible pump with ejector
# Main ballast tanks

=== Material ===
TIBEAN can be made of [[Polyethylene]], [[Polypropylene]], [[stainless steel]] and an Al/Mn- alloy. Thanks to best properties almost all facilities are made of thermoplastic materials (PE, PP) and thus are UV, weather and frost resistant.

== Applications ==
TIBEAN systems are highly variable and cover a very wide range of applications with an oxygen input from 1.5 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg/h, an application depth of 5 to 50 m and a flow rate from 600 to 7500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h.

The objectives for water body restoration or aquatic therapy can vary, depending on the priority. Therefore, the possibilities of deep water aeration systems as TIBEAN are diverse:
* Conservation of deep zones as aerobic habitat for fish and other higher organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Doke, J.L., Funk, W.H., Juul, S.T.J., Moore, B.C.: Habitat availability and benthic invertebrate population changes following alum treatment and hypolimnetic oxygenation in [[Newman Lake]], Washington. In: J. Freshwat. Ecol. 10: 87-100,1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehrli, B., Wüest, A.: Zehn Jahre Seenbelüftung: Erfahrungen und Optionen. EAWAG, Dübenedorf-Zürich, Schweiz,1996, {{ISBN|3-906484-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction of nutrient concentration in surface waters.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Prevention of sludge formation, increased ammonium production and the formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Cost reduction for drinking water production.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Targeted treatment of deep water with coagulants.

=== Drinking water production in water reservoir dams ===
Especially in respect of drinking water production, deep-water aeration allows a significant reduction of production costs and facilitates further technical treatment of the hypolimnic water.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; Since water for drinking water production is drawn from below the thermocline in most reservoirs, an improved hypolimnic water quality has direct influence on the production of drinking water. With regard to the applicable limiting values of drinking water regulations, the following effects can be achieved via deep-water aeration:

==== pH and corrosion ====
For the [[pH]] of drinking water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide an indication of the [[corrosion]] behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also [[copper]] and asbestos cement pipes.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter"&gt;Die Bedeutung einzelnen Trinkwasserparameter, Wasserverband Großraum Ansfelden, 29.08.2003,  http://wasserverbandansfelden.riscompany.net/medien/download/50330502_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted.&lt;ref name="Korrosion"&gt;Wasserqualität: Spezialteil Korrosion, www.waterquality.de, know-how online, http://www.waterquality.de/trinkwasser/K.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly [[alkalinity|alkaline]] reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, [[buffer solution]]s are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Iron and manganese ====
For concentrations of iron and manganese in drinking water, the threshold values are 200&amp;nbsp;µg/l and 50&amp;nbsp;µg/l respectively. Although they serve as essential [[trace element]]s in drinking water, slightly elevated iron and manganese concentrations are undesirable from a technical and hygienic point of view.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; At low oxygen concentrations, iron and manganese are dissolved as ions. The naturally occurring iron and manganese is mainly present as divalent, soluble ferrous/ manganous compound. At very high concentrations, a yellow water colour is noticeable. When this water is aerated, the oxidization creates ferric iron/ manganese, with iron forming red-brown and manganese forming black precipitates. These precipitates cause staining and turbidity of the water and lead to laundry stains. The precipitates can also narrow pipes and deposit on mountings. Iron levels above 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/l and manganese levels above 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l become noticeable as an unpleasant metallic taste.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; Providing an aerobic hypolimnic environment, deep-water aeration oxidizes and precipitates dissolved iron and manganese compounds, before the water is treated in a suitable facility for drinking water production. In this way further operating costs for the removal of dissolved iron and manganese compounds can be realized.

The amount and mobility of iron species also influences the redox-controlled phosphorus household.&lt;ref&gt;Lean, D.R.S., McQueen, D.J., Story, V.R.: Phosphate transport during hypolimnetic aeration. Arch. Hydrobiol. 108, 269-280, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Divalent iron compounds successively diffusing from anaerobic sediment layers are oxidized at the boundary zone between aerobic water and anaerobic sediment, and accumulate at the top sediment layer. The stronger this accumulation, the more effective the aerobic boundary between sediment and water can act as a [[diffusion]] barrier for phosphate.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Nutrient concentrations and sludge formation ====
As already mentioned, the deep-water aeration can reduce nutrient concentrations significantly. Aerobic conditions promote [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] thus contributing to nitrogen discharge of the system.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; The chemical and microbial oxidation of reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide and methane as well as the intensified degradation of organic matter can reduce the sludge formation. Aerobic conditions in the deep-water are also an important factor to decrease the redox-controlled redissolution of phosphorus from the sediment and to allow reprecipitation of released phosphorus. In this way the deep-water aeration additionally reduces costs for drinking water production by waiving denitrification stages or reducing the use of costly flocculants.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

== Planning and design ==
The final design of plants is carried out in different phases. The first step should always be a [[Echo sounding|morphometric measurement]] of the water body in order to assess the depth profile and the associated requirements for the technical design, and later on to determine the optimal location of the plant.
The exact technical design requires the evaluation of various measurements of parameters such as nutrient concentrations, temperature stratification, pH, temporal variations of oxygen concentrations as well as calculations of flow rates, mass transport quantities and distribution of [[suspended solids]] in the hypolymnion.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''''Inventio''''', one of the five canons of rhetoric, is the method used for the ''discovery of arguments'' in Western [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin]] word, meaning "invention" or "discovery". ''Inventio'' is the central, indispensable canon of rhetoric, and traditionally means a systematic search for [[argument]]s.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheryl Glenn and Melissa A. Goldthwaite|title=The St. Martin’s Guide to Teaching Writing|year=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

A speaker uses ''Inventio'' when he or she begins the thought process to form and develop an effective argument. Often, the invention phase can be seen as the first step in an attempt to generate ideas or create an argument that is convincing and compelling. The other four canons of [[classical rhetoric]] (the others being [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) rely on their interrelationship with invention.

==Purpose==
{{One source|section|date=December 2013}}
According to Crowley and Hawhee, invention is the division of rhetoric that investigates the possible means by which proofs can be discovered. It supplies the speaker and writers with sets of instructions or ideas that help them to find and compose arguments that are appropriate for a given rhetorical situation.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley and Hawhee, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For personal and lyric essays, narratives, and descriptive writing, invention techniques help writers draw from their memory and observation for the kinds of details that will add depth to their essays.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008 /&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

The first direction of invention aims toward deriving heuristic procedures or systematic strategies that will aid students in discovering and generating ideas about which they might write; the second direction of invention is characterized by how writers establish "voice" in writing and realize individual selves in discourse.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}}

One of the oldest criticisms of rhetoric is that as an art it has no proper subject matter. In other words, an orator might speak on any topic, with his success being measured purely on the brilliance of his rhetorical skills. This aspect of rhetoric is one reason why [[Plato]] attacked what he saw as empty rhetoric on the part of [[sophist]] philosophers such as [[Gorgias]].

[[Aristotle]], in his works on rhetoric, answered Plato's charges by arguing that reason and rhetoric are intertwined ("Rhetoric is the counterpart of [[Dialectic]]" is the first sentence of his ''Rhetoric''). In Aristotle's view, dialectic reasoning is the mechanism for discovering universal truths; rhetoric is the method for clarifying and communicating these principles to others. And in order to communicate effectively, an orator must be able to assemble proper arguments that support a thesis.

''Inventio'', therefore, is the systematic discovery of rhetorical practices. In the Greek and Roman traditions, rhetorical practices are often but not always arguments. Aristotle, as well as later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], devoted considerable attention to developing and formalizing the discipline of rhetorical invention. Two important concepts within invention were topoi and stasis. Other rhetorical cultures seem to have additional means of locating "available means." Historian of [[Celts|Celtic]] poetics [[Robert Graves]] credited [[analepsis]] as a method of inventing his historical arguments in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] [[medicine woman]] [[Maria Sabina]] credited the hallucinogenic [[psilocybe]] mushroom with the flow of her discourse. The philosopher Jacques Derrida described ''inventio'' as the "invention of the other."

Janice Lauer proposes that invention should be: (1) applicable to a wide variety of writing situations so that they will transcend a particular topic and can be internalized by the student; (2) flexible in direction allowing a thinker to return to a previous step or skip to an inviting one as the evolving idea suggests; and (3) highly generative by involving the writer in various operations—such as visualizing, classifying, defining, rearranging, and dividing—that are known to stimulate insights.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|155}}

==''Topoi''==
In classical rhetoric, arguments are obtained from various sources of information, or topoi ([[Greek language|Greek]] 'places'; i.e. "places to find something"), also called by the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''loci'' (''cf''. [[Literary topoi]]). Topoi are categories that help delineate the relationships among ideas; Aristotle divided these into "common" and "special" groups.

In the common group could be found such categories as laws, witnesses, contracts, oaths, comparisons of similarity, difference, or degree, definitions of things, division of things (whole or parts, for instance), cause and effect, and other items that could be analyzed, researched, or documented.

Modern writers and students use these topics, as well, when discovering arguments, although today more emphasis is placed on scientific facts, statistics, and other "hard" evidence. Classical rhetoricians saw many areas of inquiry that today's writer might view as being purely in the province of "logic," developing syllogisms, finding contradictions, as being of equal or greater importance.  Barbara Warnick has compared the 28 topics of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and topical schemes of Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca's ''The New Rhetoric'' to illustrate major differences of rhetoric throughout these time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|pages=107|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A.E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, two of Aristotle's topics "Opponent's Utterance" and "Response to Slander" were more relevant to ancient debates in the practice of Athenian law, in which every citizen was his or her own lawyer.  On the other hand, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's schemes were meant to be comprehensive rather than outlining every single detail of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=113|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A. G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Aristotle's Rhetoric focused mainly on oral endeavors, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha'sThe New Rhetoric dealt with written arguments.  Writing is a modern innovation that was looked down upon in ancient Greece.  According to Warnick, another difference between the two systems is that Aristotle developed Rhetoric as a way of spreading the practice of rhetoric so it could be performed and taught correctly.  Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's The New Rhetoric emphasized the study of rhetoric, focusing more on the understanding of the topic rather than the practice of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=112|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special topoi included such concepts as justice or injustice, virtue, good, and worthiness. Again, these are areas of inquiry seen by many today as belonging to other arts, but from Greek times through the Renaissance, these were considered integral to the study and practice of rhetoric.

Topics (or topoi) can be used to invent arguments and also to conceptualize and formulate the single-sentence declarative thesis. Edward P.J. Corbett, Robert Connors, Richard P. Hughes, and P. Albert Duhamel define topics as "ways of probing one's subject in order to find the means to develop that subject".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}} They issued four common topics that are most useful to students: definition, analogy, consequence, and testimony. Definition involves the creation of a thesis by taking a fact or an idea and explaining it by precisely identifying its nature; it always asks the question "What is/was it?" Analogy is concerned with discovering resemblances or differences between two or more things proceeding from known to unknown; it is a useful tool for investigating comparisons and contrasts because it always asks the question "What is it like or unlike?" Consequence investigates phenomena costs to effect-to-cause pattern, best established through probabilities from patterns that have previously occurred. It always answers the question "What caused/causes/will cause it?" Testimony relies on appeals to an authority (such as an expert opinion, statistics, or the law), and it always answers the question "What does an authority say about it?" "Ultimately a thesis or an argument must say something about the real world. Teaching the topics requires using examples and good examples are to be had by applying each topic to a definite subject and coming up with several thesis statements".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|156}}

==Modes of persuasion==
Aristotle described three "modes of persuasion," or "appeals."&lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|year=1924|others=Translated by W. Rhys Roberts|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, NY|page=1356a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dealt with the matter of the case (logos), the second dealt with the character of the speaker (ethos), and the third dealt with the emotions of the audience (pathos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, Pennsylvania|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.

Aristotle defined ethos as an appeal based on a speaker’s character within a persuasive act. Later, the Roman rhetorician Cicero expanded this definition to contain elements of character outside a particular rhetorical act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=1&amp;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most rhetoric scholars today combine the two definitions, understanding ethos to mean character both inside and outside a rhetorical circumstance. Speakers use the mode of ethos when they create an argument based on their own character. When relying on ethos, a speaker uses personal “trustworthiness or credibility” to persuade the audience to believe their specific argument on a particular topic (Ramage 81). For example, if a presidential candidate has a long history of philanthropy, he or she will invent an argument that demonstrates personal good character in order to convince the audience that he or she is the best candidate for office.

Pathos represents an appeal to the audience’s emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal can be achieved by the use of metaphors, storytelling, or general passion. In order to appeal to an audience’s emotions during the speech’s delivery, the speaker must first take the audience’s emotion into account during the early invention phase. For example, if a presidential candidate grew up poor and managed to succeed in life through hard work and education, then the candidate would have to apply that story to the speech-inventing process in order to appeal to the audience’s emotions. This storytelling draws upon the common "bootstraps" narrative of American culture, one that often appeals to the emotions of the U.S. electorate.

As Aristotle explains, logos, often referred to as the "logical" appeal, uses the arguments present in the case itself to appeal to the audience's reason. Aristotle writes that logos depends on "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt; Logos appeals work "when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt;  ''Inventio'' is linked with logos such that it deals with what an author would say as opposed to ''how'' it might be said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Invention|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/invention.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Stasis''==
According to rhetorical scholar Thomas O. Sloane, Cicero described rhetoric as the devising of true or seemingly true arguments for the sake of making one’s case appear probable.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=National Council of English|year=1989|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a speaker must debate both sides of an argument to invent an effective argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"/&gt; Sloane goes on to say it is important for a speaker to critique every aspect of his or her argument. Ciceronian invention is simply an analytical process of argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a theorist of law, Cicero put forward a specific procedure commonly referred to as stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"/&gt;

Stasis is a procedure by which a speaker poses questions in order to clarify the main issues and persuasive points of a speech or debate.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure allows the speaker to critically question each point, assessing the relative worth of each point as appropriate to the substance of the case and to its capacity to persuade an audience.

Using stasis theory gives the speaker numerous advantages that will help them excel in persuading. According to Crowley and Hawhee, the following advantages may accrue in the use of stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"/&gt;

*Allows the speaker to clarify his or her thinking about the point in dispute.
*Allows the speaker to consider the assumption and values an audience holds. 
*Establishes certain areas in which more research and effort needs to be spent.
*Distinguishes which points are crucial to an effective argument.
*Guides the speaker towards building an effective arrangement for their argument or speech.

There are four types of stasis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawhee, Debra and Sharon Crowley|chapter=Stasis theory: Asking the right questions |title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students |year=1999|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; conjectural (question of fact: Is/was it?), definitional (question of definition: What is/what is its meaning?), qualitative (question of quality: How good or bad is/was it), and translative (question of place or procedure: Is/was this appropriate process or place to handle the matter?). For instance, a lawyer defending someone accused of damaging property might pose the following questions:

*Question of fact: did the person damage the item? (conjectural)
*Question of definition: was the damage minor or major? (definitional)
*Question of quality: was he justified in damaging the item? (qualitative)
*Question of jurisdiction: should this be a civil or criminal trial? (translative)

The question of fact is key as the first step in formulating any argument is separating the true from the false. If the terms of the argument at hand cannot be agreed on, the discussion will not move in any positive direction. Going back and forth attacking sources of information is not conducive to making any real progress, so an emphasis on using only solid information and evidence-based anecdotes is at the crucial to achieving stasis

The question of definition means to define what, exactly, the issue of concern is, and what, if any, biases or preconceptions our arguments hold. Then, categorizing the problem is the next focus, agreeing on the class of the event and therefore the attitude with which it should be approached. A political disagreement should be investigated with a different lens than a criminal case, for example, as they are concerns of a different nature.

The question of quality means identifying the magnitude of the event, the wider impacts, as well as what would happen if no action were to be taken. Identifying if this problem is important as part of a bigger picture is key to preparing a sound argument, as well as figuring out whether or not it is a cause worth pursuing. The quality aspect of stasis comes down to deciding if this particular problem requires attention, and at what cost will a resolution come about.

The question of jurisdiction means formulating a plan of action. Just as we calculate whether the particular problem is worth the energy in the quality category, here we make the decision to take action. A plan of action includes determining what kind of people should be involved in solving this problem, and what strategy these people will use.&lt;ref&gt;https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/736/1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention in the rhetorical tradition==
Invention also entails the adaptation of ideas and stylistic devices to unfamiliar audiences.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=John M.|title=Inventing Authority: Bill Clinton, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Orchestration of Rhetorical Traditions|year=1997|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar John M. Murphy argues that rhetorical traditions consist of common patterns of language use and organized “social knowledge” of communities that make resources available for the invention of effective arguments.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt; Invention allows these rhetorical traditions to be adapted across cultural differences or situations. Murphy provides an example in which an orator would blend several rhetorical traditions: one by which the orator might primarily identify and another by which the audience might identify, thus merging speaker and audience through a display of interconnected rhetorical traditions.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt;

To Cicero, traditional rhetoric was a "mode of thought" and to attain this rhetoric it is required to make the "true nature of rhetorical inventio" apparent.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloane|first=Thomas O.|title=Reinventing Inventio|journal=College English|date=Sep 1989|volume=51|issue=5|pages=303–473|doi=10.2307/378000|jstor=378000|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas O. Sloane, a rhetorical scholar, discusses that ''inventio'' in the rhetorical tradition specifically refers to addressing the pros and cons of an argumentation.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  Sloane argues that it is required when using ''inventio'' as a tool that one must not only consider the discourse at hand but the discourses that accompany the positives and negatives attached.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In further explanation, one must debate all sides of an argument "or one's ''inventio'' will remain not fully invented."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In modern revivals of rhetoric, Sloane argues along with Reed Way Dasenbrock that these pros and cons of ''inventio'' do not have as much emphasis as they did in Cicero.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  This lack of attention to different sides of an argument is why Dasenbrock believes that the revival of rhetoric "is relevant; [but] it isn't complete."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;

==Amplification and invention==
[[Amplification (rhetoric)|Amplification]] is a term in rhetoric defined as the enrichment of words to increase rhetorical effect.  It is closely related to invention such that it deals with the development and progression of notions, drawing from the topics of invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Figures of Amplification|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Groupings/of%20amplification.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Topics of invention can also be seen as topics of amplification, especially those of division, definition, and comparison.

'''Jakob Rosenberg''' (1893 – 1980) was a German-US art historian and [[Rembrandt]] scholar.

Rosenberg was born in [[Berlin]] into a family of art dealers and in the years 1912-1914 he first did an internship in the art trade in Munich. After serving in WWI he was captured by the British in 1915 and was sent to Switzerland by prisoner exchange. After the war he studied art history in Bern and Zurich, then in Frankfurt and Munich, where he received his doctorate under [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]. He then worked for [[Max J. Friedlander]] in the Berlin print cabinet ''[[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]'', where he also had contact with [[Wilhelm von Bode]]. In 1935 he beame a curator there but was dismissed the same year for racial reasons. After a visit to Harvard in 1936, Jakob Rosenberg emigrated to the United States in 1937, where he was admitted to Harvard University through Adolph Goldschmidt and his friend Paul Sachs. He was first a research fellow and lecturer, in 1940 associate professor and in 1947 full professor. His 1948 overview work on Rembrandt was reprinted in 1964 and 1968, holding its own as a standard work during the early years of the [[Rembrandt Research Project]]. He was also director of the Graphic Collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 1939.

In 1954 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Jacob Rosenberg married Elisabeth Husserl, the daughter of [[Edmund Husserl]], in 1922.

Rosenberg died in [[Cambridge]].

During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krist Anthony Novoselic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|v|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{lang-hr|'''Krist Novoselić'''}}; born May 16, 1965) is an [[Americans|American]] [[musician]] and [[Activism|political activist]], and was the [[bassist]] and founding member of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] alongside [[guitarist]] and [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] [[Kurt Cobain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvana.com/|title=Official Nirvana Website: Complete Discography, Videos and more|website=www.nirvana.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana|title=Nirvana {{!}} Music|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana achieved massive success, earning multiple gold and [[Platinum (award)|platinum awards]] and touring around the world at sold-out shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7518783/nirvana-nevermind-nine-chart-facts-anniversary|title=Nirvana's 'Nevermind': 9 Chart Facts About the Iconic Album|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his musical endeavours, Novoselic has been active politically, including the creation of the [[political action committee]] JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/politics/career.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2010 he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'s'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|title=Reverb – "Krist Novoselic" Archives – Seattle Weekly|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006203927/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|archivedate=October 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 Novoselic has been board chair of the [[electoral reform]] organization [[FairVote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/tags/author_krist_novoselic|title=Author krist novoselic at FairVote|last=FairVote.org|website=FairVote|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krist Anthony Novoselic was born on May 16, 1965 to [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/krist-novoselic-ne-vjeruje-bushu/114008.aspx|title=Krist Novoselic ne vjeruje Bushu|publisher=index|work=index.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/showtime/glazba/24409/Nirvanin-basist-hrvatskog-porijekla-duboko-u-politici.html|title=Nirvanin basist hrvatskog porijekla duboko u politici|publisher=tportal|work=tportal.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/17042010/novaselici-nismo-ni-sanjali-da-ce-nam-sin-postati-rock-zvijezda|title=Novaselići: Nismo ni sanjali da će nam sin postati rock zvijezda!|publisher=[[Zadarski list]]|work=zadarskilist.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant parents, Kristo and Maria, in [[Compton, California]]. He lived there for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/audio/interviews/mp3/media/krist2.mp3 Interview with Krist Novoselic – Audio file]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humoropedia.com/krist-novoselic/|title=5 Unreal Facts About Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic You’D Never Believe|work=Humoropedia|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic has a younger brother Robert, born in 1968, and a younger sister, Diana, born in 1973. In 1979, his family relocated to [[Aberdeen, Washington]] as a result of surging real estate costs in California. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Younger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/younger.php|title=Novoselic Dedication Page|publisher=novoselic.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memories of listening to music was listening to [[Chuck Berry]] with his father. Growing up, he had a "severe" [[Malocclusion|underbite]], for which underwent corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kristnovoselicescalators.tumblr.com/post/142188663820/novoselic-91-i-had-started-reading-michael|title=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic — Novoselic ‘91 I had started reading Michael...|website=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pavitt commodore.jpg|thumb|Novoselic with Kathleen Hanna, Bruce Pavitt and Dylan Carlson, Paramount Theater, Seattle, October 31st, 1991]]
Novoselic was already interested in [[Hard rock|hard rock bands]] such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Who]], [[Van Halen]], [[Devo]] and [[Aerosmith]]. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Prljavo kazalište]] and [[Azra]]. While in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he picked up an interest in [[punk rock]], and discovered bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Ramones]] when he lived in Croatia at the age of 14 for one year.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/krist-novoselic/110291/biography|title=Krist Novoselic Biography – AOL Music|publisher=Music.aol.com|date=May 16, 1965|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalweb.com/nirvana2/101_random_facts.htm|title=101 Random Facts|website=www.goalweb.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[John Entwistle]], and [[Gene Simmons]] as the fundamental influences of his bass playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Krist Novoselic: My Favorite Bass Players (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080836/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|archivedate=August 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Novoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend [[Kurt Cobain]], who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to [[punk rock]]. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair ended up sharing similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band [[Melvins]]. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] and Kurt attended Montesano High School (Washington). At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his former band [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]], and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nirvana/biography|title=Nirvana Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Novoselic worked as a [[House painter and decorator|painter and decorator]] and was eventually laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wattpad.com/301062129-nirvana-facts-krist-novoselic|title=Nirvana FACTS - Krist Novoselic  - Wattpad|website=www.wattpad.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nirvana (1987–1994) ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
	 
Cobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] [[cover band]], in which Cobain played [[Drum kit|drums]] and Novoselic sang and played [[guitar]]. That band was short-lived as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You are: The Story of Nirvana|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|isbn=0-385-47199-8|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]]. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1987.php|title=Nirvana Live Guide - 1987|website=www.nirvanaguide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer [[Dale Crover]] filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met [[Chad Channing]]. The trio recorded their debut [[album]] ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subpop.com/releases/nirvana/bleach_deluxe_edition|title=Bleach: Deluxe Edition|last=Records|first=Sub Pop|website=Sub Pop Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and [[Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/surprising-drummer-reveals-missed-joining-nirvana-twice/|title=Surprising Drummer Reveals How He Missed Out On Joining Nirvana Twice|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-01-13|work=AlternativeNation.net|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/nirvana-chad-channing-no-regrets/|title=Chad Channing Recalls His Time in Nirvana Without Regrets|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic contributed to song writing of various songs, helping out Cobain, such as giving ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselic-on-kurts-writing-process-and-the-in-utero-aesthetic-20131003|title=Krist Novoselic on Kurt Cobain's Writing Process|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-scream-mn0001287850|title=The Scream {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were impressed by their drummer, [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/dave-grohls-first-band-scream-to-reissue-1988-album-no-more-censorship/|title=Dave Grohl’s first band, Scream, to reissue 1988 album No More Censorship|date=2018-03-29|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from [[San Francisco]], where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final [[drummer]]. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their ''Bleach'' Album. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardrock.com/rpm/nirvana-signs-to-a-major-or-how-kim-gordon-saved-the-world/|title=NIRVANA SIGNS TO A MAJOR (or how Kim Gordon saved the world)|work=Hard Rock presents Revolutions Per Minute|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] to record ''[[Nevermind]].'' Novoselic helped write the song "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]". Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/howling-in-the-abyss-the-improbable-success-of-nirvanas-nevermind/|title=Howling in the Abyss: The Improbable Success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind'|date=2016-09-23|work=Observer|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Nevermind]]'' had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/nirvana-debuted-smells-like-teen-spirit-22-years-ago-tonight-20130417|title=Watch Nirvana Debut 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Live in 1991|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, at the [[MTV Music Awards|MTV music awards show]], Nirvana would win awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician [[Brian May]] ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/10/nirvanas-eight-most-rock-n-roll-moments.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nirvana-181-1336070|title=Nirvana bassist reveals Brian May helped him after bass-throwing injury - NME|date=2008-11-20|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvanas-novoselic-relives-failed-1992-vma-bass-toss-20081120|title=Nirvana's Novoselic Relives Failed 1992 VMA Bass Toss|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a [[compilation album]] named ''[[Incesticide]]''. Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs "[[Dive (Nirvana song)|Dive]]", "[[Hairspray Queen]]", and "[[Incesticide|Aneurysm]]" on the album.

During Nirvana's 1992 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading]] concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/songguide/bodyd9ac.html?songid=179|title=The Money Will Roll Right In|website=www.livenirvana.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic was an occasional [[vocalist]] and [[backing vocalist]] in Nirvana, occasionally singing "[[Scoff (song)|Scoff]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" at live shows. Novoselic stated that "I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/adrift/articles/guitar.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1993, Nirvana worked on their third album [[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']], it debuted at number one on the [[billboard 200]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nirvana/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177363|title=Nirvana In Utero Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recording sessions mixed by [[Steve Albini]] were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound perfect" as well as the Novoselic and the rest of the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". ''In Utero'' sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5b8c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Nirvana - In Utero|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/in-utero-19930916|title=In Utero|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Nirvana performed on [[MTV Unplugged]] with [[Lori Goldston]] playing [[cello]], the introduction of guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]],'' which earned a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|best alternative music performance.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-20110517|title=100 Best Albums of the '90s|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-album-anniversary/|title=23 Years Ago: 'Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York' Released|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/deep-10-nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-new-york|title=Deep 10: Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York|date=2016-11-03|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/krist-novoselic-kurt-cobain-clear-mind-wouldnt-have-killed-himself/|title=Krist Novoselic Discusses Kurt Cobain's Suicide|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, where the video for Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" was awarded for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1994/mtvvmas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 1994 MTV Video Music Awards|website=www.rockonthenet.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several songs, including "Exhausted", "[[Big Me]]", "[[February Stars]]", and "Butterflies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2013/09/09/220657501/dave-grohl-and-krist-novoselic-share-memories-unreleased-tracks-from-in-utero|title=Dave Grohl And Krist Novoselic Share Memories, Unreleased Tracks From 'In Utero'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived. The song "[[You Know You're Right]]" was the band's final studio recording. The band had split up following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Kurt's death]], with both members going their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/features/krist-novoselic-on-nirvanas-rise-traumatic-end-and-his-future-with-giants-in-the-trees/|title=Krist Novoselic On Nirvana's Rise, Traumatic End And His Future With Giants In The Trees — Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic and Grohl continued to support the Nirvana franchise. Novoselic worked on completing the ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' [[box set]] and ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]'' album, as well as pushing for release of a [[Nevermind|20th anniversary album for ''Nevermind'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/discography.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Nirvana (1995–present) ===
After Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band [[Sweet 75]] with Seattle musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single [[Sweet 75 (album)|self-titled album]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselics-ecelctic-new-sound-19970911|title=Krist Novoselic’s Ecelctic New Sound|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=1997-09-11|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/sweet75/info.html|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com -|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Novoselic joined singer [[Johnny Cash]], guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]] and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] to record a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", for the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-27/entertainment/ca-29172_1_willie-nelson |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Novoselic directed his first movie, ''[[L7 (band)|L7]]: [[The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum|The Beauty Process]]'', a [[pseudo-documentary]] that utilizes [[concert]] footage taped in 1997 in three American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://clatsopnews.com/2017/09/28/kris-novoselic/|title=Krist Novoselic: Famous Rock Star Lives Among Us - ClatsopNews|last=Publisher|first=ClatsopNews|date=2017-09-28|work=ClatsopNews|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/l7.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|title=L7: The Beauty Process|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213788/|others=Bryan Lee Brown, Suzi Gardner, Gail Greenwood|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he joined [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Soundgarden]] guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] in the [[No WTO Combo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/569932/correction-novoselic-biafra-were-in-no-wto-combo/|title=CORRECTION: Novoselic, Biafra Were In No-WTO Combo|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alternativetentacles.com/artists/no-wto-combo/|title=Alternative Tentacles Records|date=2018-01-19|work=Alternative Tentacles Records|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Krist Novoselic, 2007.jpg|thumb|Novoselic in 2007.]]
In 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background [[vocals]] on Foo Fighters' song "Walking a Line", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'' album sessions. The track is included on the ''One by One'' bonus [[DVD]], as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former [[Meat Puppets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeatpuppets.com/|title=Meat Puppets|website=www.themeatpuppets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; front man [[Curt Kirkwood]] and former [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] drummer [[Bud Gaugh]] to form [[Eyes Adrift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there was another group called "Eyes Adrift", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album "Bud, Curt &amp; Krist" in this nation. Eyes adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the [[Japan]]ese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], singing lead on "Inquiring Minds", "Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel" and "Pasted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-251464/|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-08-27|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a single named ''Alaska''.

Following the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in recent years, Novoselic has occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, "Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about."&lt;ref&gt;Jasmin, Earnest. "Novoselic drops hint of making solo album". ''[[The News Tribune]]'' January 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]. In October 2010, [[Dave Grohl]], former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on [[BBC]] [[radio]], that Novoselic would be joining [[Foo Fighters]] as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/952506/foo-fighters-return-dave-grohl-recruits-krist-novoselic |title=Foo Fighters Return, Dave Grohl Recruits Krist Novoselic |work=Billboard  |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[encore]] of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in [[Tarzana, California]] on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist [[Pat Smear]] for a version of Nirvana's "[[Marigold (song)|Marigold]]" a 1992 Grohl original, which was a [[B-side]] on Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=Foo Fighters Secret Show Becomes Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/12/22/foo-fighters-secret-show-becomes-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion on the song "[[I Should Have Known (Foo Fighters song)|I Should Have Known]]", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album called ''[[Wasting Light]]'', released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=New Foo Fighters Album Will Be a Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/10/28/new-foo-fighters-album-will-be-a-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2017, Novoselic joined Foo Fighters on stage at [[Matthew Knight Arena]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], to play bass guitar on "[[Big Me]]", a song off Foo Fighters debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-surviving-nirvana-members-reunite-at-foo-fighters-show-w513601|title=See Surviving Nirvana Members Reunite at Foo Fighters Show|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months later, on October 6, 2018, Novoselic joined the band during an encore to play several Nirvana songs, with Dave Grohl on drums, Pat Smear on guitar, and Joan Jett filling in as their lead singer.

== Political and social activism ==
[[File:Krist Novoselic 15A.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Novoselic in 2008]]
Novoselic has had an interest in politics from high school. This included the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] conflict between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=garyalexw|title=Nirvana in Belfast - MTV News|date=2012-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyVYQvQPk|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nirvana/1992/kings-hall-belfast-northern-ireland-63d67e4f.html|title=Nirvana Setlist at King's Hall, Belfast|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state legislature attempted to pass a [[Bill (law)|bill]] called the Erotic Music Law. The [[law]] would allow courts to declare certain albums "erotic" by their content, and would make it illegal to sell those albums to those under the age of 18. A lobbying group called the Washington Music Industry Coalition formed as a response to the bill. Novoselic and Nirvana actively [[Campaigner|campaigned]] against the bill and performed a benefit concert for the [[Advocacy group|lobbying group]] in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/nirvana-bassist-turns-politician|title=Nirvana Bassist Turns Politician|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krist appeared on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] [[KOMO-TV]]{{'}}s "Town Meeting" in March 1992 arguing his points and expressing his views with two opposing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RareNirvana|title=Krist Novoselic on Komo TV's "Town Meeting" Show in 1992|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrog9H-Yd0|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Erotic Music Law was reintroduced to the [[Washington State Legislature]] as the Matters Harmful to Minors bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/senator-krist-19960208|title=Senator Krist: An Interview With Krist Novoselic|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the music industry had serious clout in Seattle given the success of the scene, Novoselic proposed creating a [[political action committee]], which was named JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/then-now-krist-novoselic-musician-1.608822|title=Then &amp; now Krist Novoselic, musician|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, JAMPAC fought a number of different issues, including the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]], a 1985 law that strictly limited the ability of minors to attend shows. With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/icons-of-rock-krist-novoselic/|title=Icons Of Rock: Krist Novoselic|date=2011-05-01|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic remains active in politics making appearances to advocate [[electoral reform]] (especially [[instant-runoff voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-ic.galegroup.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/ic/ovic/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Magazines&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA126653168&amp;mode=view|title=Krist Novoselic: Smells Like Governance|author=Katherine Turman|publisher=Opposing Viewpoints|date=January–February 2005|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[proportional representation]]) and running the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fixour.us/|title=Wahkiakum Democrats Precinct Caucus|publisher=Fixour.us|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered a 2004 run for [[Lieutenant governor|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]], challenging an incumbent of the same party, but ultimately decided against it. He also joined the board of [[FairVote]], then the Center for Voting and Democracy, and was appointed chair in January 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kornelis|first=Chris|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Smells Like a New Blogger: Krist Novoselic (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907194917/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/2007/11/smells_like_a_new_blogger_kris.php|archivedate=September 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |title=Barack Obama For President |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130232930/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php/ |title=Presidential Pick-A-Problem Primary |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102131705/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php |archivedate=November 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since broken with the Democratic Party, partly because "it's a top-down structure" adverse to reform from its grassroots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic?%20Run%20blog))|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, FairVote, Dumping the Dems, &amp;amp; Why the GOP Should Embrace Anarchy|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grange is not actually a political party.

[[File:KristNovoselicpodium.jpg|thumb|Novoselic giving a speech during his political career.]]
Novoselic continues to support political reform, even looking at [[social network]]s such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as major factors in shaping the political future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2013011568_novoselic27web.html|title=Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic sees political potential in social networks|author=Carla Meyer|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=September 27, 2010|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his support for [[Voting|fair voting]] reforms on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Washington Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/309013-5|title=Krist Novoselic on Electoral Reforms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Novoselic was asked how he described his [[Ideology|political views]], and he responded, "I'm an [[anarcho-capitalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], moderate... I don't know" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic (at 11:30)&lt;/ref&gt; On his [[Twitter]] page, he announced that he had voted for 2016 [[Libertarian]] [[presidential candidate]] [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KristNovoselic/status/594881482914562048|title=Krist Novoselić on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, he supported [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|his political campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic |first=Krist |url=http://kristnovoselic.blogspot.com/2015/08/real-election-reform-enters-2016.html |title=This Is Krist Novoselić: Real Election Reform Enters The 2016 Race |publisher=Kristnovoselic.blogspot.com |date=2015-08-12 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leave No Trace''' is a set of [[outdoor]] [[ethics]] promoting [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] in the outdoors. It consists of seven principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview|title=Seven Principles Overview {{!}} Leave No Trace|website=lnt.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# plan ahead and prepare,
# travel and camp on durable surfaces,
# [[waste disposal|dispose of waste]] properly,
# leave what you find,
# minimize [[campfire]] impacts,
# respect [[wildlife]],
# be considerate of other visitors.

These  principles have been adapted to different activities, ecosystems and environments. Since 1994, '''Leave No Trace Center For Outdoor Ethics''', a non-profit organization also known as Leave No Trace, exists to educate people about their recreational impact on nature as well as the principles of Leave No Trace to prevent and minimize such impacts.

==Origins==
In the mid 20th-century there was a cultural shift in [[wilderness]] ethics from [[woodcraft]] where wilderness travelers prided themselves on their ability to rely on the resources of wild lands to a post-WWII ethics of minimal [[environmental impact|impact on the environment]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner|first=J.M.|title=From Woodcraft to 'Leave No Trace':Wilderness, Consumerism, and Environmentalism in Twentieth-Century America |journal=Environmental History| pages=462–484| volume=7| date=July 2002|url=http://environmentalhistory.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7-3_Turner.pdf |doi= 10.2307/3985918| format=PDF| issue=3| jstor=3985918| publisher=Environmental History, Vol. 7, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leave No Trace began in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="lnthist"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |url=http://lnt.org/about/history.html |title=In Depth History of Leave No Trace |work= |publisher=Leave No Trace |accessdate=2006-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718233839/http://www.lnt.org/about/history.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large increase of wilderness visitation following the creation of new recreational equipment such as white gas stoves, synthetic tents, and sleeping pads. This began a commercial interest in [[outdoor recreation]] which in turn caused more visitors to national parks.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; In those decades, the [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], and the [[National Park Service]] started to teach their non-motorized visitors how to have a minimal impact on the land. Wilderness Informational Specialists were trained to educate visitors on minimal impact camping in the different parks. In 1987 the three departments cooperatively developed a pamphlet titled "Leave No Trace Land Ethics".&lt;ref name="USFSLNThist"&gt;{{cite web | last = Marion | first = Jeffrey L. | authorlink = |author2=Scott E. Reid  | year = 2001 | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev2_038125.pdf | format=PDF | title = Development of the U.S. Leave No Trace Program: An Historical Perspective | work = | publisher = U.S. Forest Service | accessdate = 2012-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1970s, groups such as the [[Sierra Club]] were advocating minimum impact camping techniques. The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) had been actively advocating training and implementation of Leave No Trace and outdoor ethics principles early in the 1970s at such places as [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] in Northern [[New Mexico]]. A pilot program in the 1980s between the BSA and the Bureau of Land Management in the [[High Uintas Wilderness]] tried to reach a wide audience.

The national education program of Leave No Trace was developed in 1990 by the [[United States Forest Service]] in conjunction with the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] (NOLS). At the time the USFS also created other programs such as [[Smokey Bear]], [[Woodsy Owl]], and previously in 1985 the [[Tread Lightly!]] program which was geared towards motorized recreation. The [[Bureau of Land Management]] joined the program in 1993 followed by the [[National Park Service]] and [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=USFSLNThist/&gt;

==Principles==
Leave No Trace provides a framework for outdoor recreation decision making, which is summarized in the following seven principles.  Originally developed for the "[[backcountry]]", there are now also seven "frontcountry" principles as well:&lt;ref name="lntprin"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| url =http://www.lnt.org/programs/lnt7/index.html| title =Seven Principles of Leave No Trace| work =| publisher =Leave No Trace| accessdate =2006-08-03| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060813092832/http://www.lnt.org/programs/lnt7/index.html| archivedate =2006-08-13| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcountry===
# Plan ahead and prepare: Poorly prepared people, when presented with unexpected situations, often resort to high-impact solutions that degrade the outdoors or put themselves at risk. Proper planning leads to less impact.
# Travel and camp on durable surfaces: Damage to land occurs when surface vegetation or communities of organisms are trampled beyond repair. The resulting barren area leads to unusable trails, campsites, and [[soil]] [[erosion]].
# Dispose of waste properly: Trash and litter in the backcountry ranks high as a problem in the minds of many backcountry visitors. This will greatly detract from the naturalness of an area and could potentially cause greater environmental damage.  If no trash receptacles are available, visitors should carry out all trash from what they have brought in.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm| title=Pack it in, pack it out| work=Teaching leave no trace| publisher=U.S. Bureau of Land Management|accessdate=2007-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814105440/http://www.blm.gov/education/lnt/background/packing.htm |archivedate = 2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, backcountry campers create [[wastewater|waste water]] from certain activities and fecal waste which requires proper disposal according to Leave No Trace principles.  (Urinating in the woods is not a violation of Leave No Trace. However, if defecating one must not leave any toilet paper, and the waste is to be buried a certain distance from both paths and water sources). 
# Leave what you find: Leave No Trace directs people to minimize site alterations by avoiding actions such as digging tent trenches, cutting branches from live trees, hammering nails into trees, permanently clearing an area of rocks or twigs, or removing other natural items.
# Minimize campfire impacts: Because the naturalness of many areas has been degraded by overuse of fires, Leave No Trace teaches to seek alternatives to fires or use low-impact fires.
# Respect wildlife: minimizing impact on wildlife and ecosystems.
# Be considerate of other visitors: Following hiking etiquette and maintaining quiet allows visitors to go through the wilderness with minimal impact on other users.

===Frontcountry===
# Know before you go
# Stick to trails and camp overnight right
# Stash your trash and pick up waste
# Leave it as you find it
# Be careful with fire
# Keep wildlife wild
# Share our trails and manage your pet

==Scientific foundation==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Two primary scientific disciplines form the foundation of the Leave No Trace program: [[recreation ecology]] and [[human dimensions of natural resources]]. Recreation ecology research, "a field of study that examines, assesses and monitors visitor impacts, typically to protected natural areas, and their relationships to influential factors" has provided the foundation for Leave No Trace messaging because of its focus on recreational impacts. Recreation ecology has dominated most minimum-impact research, and reviews suggest that there have been over one thousand recreation ecology articles published within recent decades. Examples include both ecological and social impacts of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rendezvous.nols.edu//content/category/46/262/733/|title=rendezvous.nols.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the behavior of outdoor enthusiasts is perhaps{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} the largest determinant of impact, and human dimensions research, which focuses on the sociological, psychological, cultural, and economic aspects of recreationists is limited but growing with regard to Leave No Trace-related studies.

The majority of human dimensions research related to Leave No Trace has evaluated educational effectiveness through various communication strategies in an effort to increase knowledge and influence behavioral change. For example, studies have evaluated communication strategies to mitigate human and wildlife conflict, reduce litter, minimize removal of natural objects or deter off-trail hiking. Few studies have addressed Leave No Trace specifically, instead focusing on minimum-impact behaviors broadly, and even fewer studies have evaluated the most common user-group, frontcountry visitors. More recently, however, social scientists have explored concepts such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, and behaviors of outdoor enthusiasts in the context of Leave No Trace practices, and have begun examining the perceptions of frontcountry visitors.

Since 1994, a Leave No Trace program has been managed by the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics.&lt;ref name="lnthome"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url = http://lnt.org/ | title = Center for Outdoor Ethics | work =  | publisher = Leave No Trace | accessdate = 2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization, is dedicated to the responsible enjoyment and active stewardship of the outdoors worldwide. 

The Center's mission is to teach people how to enjoy the outdoors responsibly. This mission is accomplished through education, research, volunteerism and partnerships. Leave No Trace tries to build awareness, appreciation and respect for wildlands. 

The Center has partnerships with the [[National Park Service]], the [[U.S. Forest Service]], the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]],&lt;ref name="lntnp"&gt;[http://www.lnt.org/support/nonprofits.php LNT Non-profit Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205153039/http://lnt.org/support/nonprofits.php |date=2011-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], and other partners such as colleges, universities, outfitter/guide services, small businesses, non-profits and youth serving organizations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[American Camp Association]].

There are also formal Leave No Trace organisations in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=October 2015}}
Despite the fact that Leave No Trace is a widely accepted [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] ethic, there has been a good amount of criticism. Environmental historian James Morton Turner argued in 2002 that Leave No Trace focused attention of backpackers "largely on protecting wilderness as a [[recreation]]al landscape" rather than tackling larger questions, such as "the modern economy, [[consumerism]], and the environment".&lt;ref name=JSTOR1&gt;{{cite journal| jstor=3985918|title=From Woodcraft to 'Leave No Trace': Wilderness, Consumerism, and Environmentalism in Twentieth-Century America |journal=Environmental History |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner also argues that this ethic omitted the calculus behind it, and the code itself, in his view, "helped ally the modern backpacker with the wilderness recreation industry" by encouraging backpackers to practice the Leave No Trace ethic while in the wilderness and to keep an eye out for the logo of this ethic in shopping malls.&lt;ref name=JSTOR1 /&gt;

Gregory Simon and Peter Alagona had a different argument, saying in a 2009 article that there should be a move beyond Leave No Trace. They argued that this ethic "disguises much about human relationships with non-human nature" because it makes it seem that parks and wilderness areas are "pristine nature" which in their view, "erases their human histories, and prevents people from understanding how these landscapes
have developed over time through complex human–environment interactions".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Beyond_Leave_No_Trace.pdf| title=Beyond Leave No Trace| publisher=Ethics, Place and Environment| accessdate=2014-10-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101004332/http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Beyond_Leave_No_Trace.pdf| archivedate=2014-11-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the place of this ethic, they say that there should be a  new [[environmental ethic]] "that transforms the critical scholarship of social science into a critical practice of wilderness recreation, addresses the global economic system...and reinvents wilderness recreation as a more collaborative, participatory, productive, democratic, and radical form of political action".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; In the article they also write about how certain corporations in the outdoor recreation industry and magazines like ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' support Leave No Trace (LNT), but that in stores for outdoor recreation products like [[REI]], "the LNT logo becomes both a corporate brand and an official stamp of approval".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt;

The authors also argue that because LNT "focuses on the immediate, local impacts of recreational use while ignoring larger issues of change over time and connections through space" it has what they consider "two conceptual flaws": the idea that the current wilderness is in a "natural, pristine condition" and the obscuring of the "spatial connections between what takes place inside parks and wilderness areas and what occurs outside".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; The authors note that additionally, this ethic is limited in scope, offering "a code of conduct calibrated to the particular, limited, and arbitrary geographic scale of parks and wilderness areas".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; They articulate their new environmental ethic as expanding LNT, not rejecting it all together, expanding its "spatial scale beyond the boundaries of parks and wilderness areas...broaden[ing] LNT’s ethical purview to include the global economic systems that make contemporary American wilderness recreation possible", redefining recreationists rather than "passive ethical subjects and consumers, to active participants in collaborative programs" and in sum, "a more democratic, more participatory, and more radical vision of outdoor recreation as a form of political action".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt; Near the end of the article, the authors articulate the seven principles of what they call 'Beyond Leave No Trace':&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT /&gt;
# Educate yourself and others about the places you visit
# Purchase only the equipment and clothing you need
# Take care of the equipment and clothing you have
# Make conscientious food, equipment, and clothing consumption choices
# Minimize waste production
# Reduce [[energy consumption]]
# Get involved by conserving and restoring the places you visit

Three years later, Simon and Alagona responded to critiques of their 2009 article calling for a 'Beyond Leave No Trace' approach. They argued that they were not the first to explore LNT's history, that they "joined a growing chorus of researchers", and importantly that they "remain steadfast in our endorsement of LNT’s value and potential" but that they believe that "this simple ethic is not enough in a world of global capital circulation where the goods we produce and consume in order to enjoy the outdoors can have long-term and far-reaching social and environmental ramifications".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Alagona%20%26%20Simon%202012.pdf| title=Leave No Trace Starts at Home: A Response to Critics and Vision for the Future| publisher=Ethics, Place and Environment| accessdate=2014-10-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101004203/http://www.gregory-simon.com/GLS/Research_and_Publications_files/Alagona%20%26%20Simon%202012.pdf| archivedate=2014-11-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While dismissing the concerns of critics, they write that, firstly, Leave No Trace "could not exist in its current form without a plethora of consumer products;" secondly, that "the use of such products does not erase environmental impacts;" and thirdly that LNT "systematically obscures these impacts, displacements, and connections by encouraging the false belief that it is possible to 'leave no trace'".&lt;ref name=BeyondLNT2 /&gt;

Other critics of Leave No Trace have argued that it is impractical, displaces [[environmental impact of tourism|environmental impacts]] to other locations, "obscures connections between the uses of outdoor products and their production and disposal impacts" and have questioned how much the ethic affects everyday environmental behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512002680| title=Contradictions at the confluence of commerce, consumption and conservation; or, an REI shopper camps in the forest, does anyone notice?| accessdate=2014-10-31 | doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.11.022| volume=45| journal=Geoforum|pages=325–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wea.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/2013_colloquium/2013%20olrs%20book%20of%20abstracts_final.pdf#page=22| title=Environmentally Responsible Behavior and the Application of Leave No Trace beyond the Backcountry|publisher=Outdoor Leadership Research Symposium|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27519">'''Legal informatics''' is an area within [[information science]]. Erdelez and O'Hare (1997) define legal informatics as follows:

:The [[American Library Association]] defines [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] as "the study of the [[structure]] and [[properties]] of [[information]], as well as the application of [[technology]] to the [[Categorization|organization]], [[archive|storage]], [[information retrieval|retrieval]], and dissemination of information." Legal informatics therefore, pertains to the application of informatics within the context of the legal environment and as such involves [[law]]-related [[organization]]s (e.g., law offices, [[court]]s, and [[law school]]s) and [[User (computing)|user]]s of information and [[information technology|information technologies]] within these organizations.

==Delivery of legal services==
Advances in [[technology]] and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a "bespoke" product created by a professional [[Lawyer|attorney]] on an individual basis for each client.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"&gt;Richard Susskind, From Bespoke to Commodity, LEGAL TECH. J., 2006, at 4, 4–7. {{cite web |url=http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/21/51/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129134550/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk//content//view//21//51// |archivedate=2011-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt; Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.&lt;ref name="SusskindArticle"/&gt;

===Cloud computing and legal services===
The widespread introduction of [[cloud computing]] provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the [[Software as a Service]] model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.
* Software as a service is much more [[scalable]]. Traditional bespoke models require an attorney to spend more of a limited resource (their time) on each additional client. Using Software as a Service, a legal service provider can put in effort once to develop the product and then use a much less limited resource (cloud computing power) to provide service to each additional customer.
* Software as a service can be used to complement traditional bespoke services by handling routine tasks, leaving an attorney free to concentrate on bespoke work.
* Software as a service can be delivered more conveniently because it does not require the legal service provider to be available at the same time as the customer.

Software as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for [[attorney-client privilege]].  The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be [[Privilege (evidence)|legally privileged]].&lt;ref name="Johnsonarticle"&gt;Chris Johnson, Leveraging Technology to Deliver Legal Services, 23 HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH.259, 279 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latent markets===
Because the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally [[inelastic]]. Households that are ineligible for [[legal aid]] but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the [[American Bar Association]] Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that "among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action."&lt;ref name="DeliveryReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/delivery/deltech.html|title=Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services - Standing Committee / Delivery of Legal Services|author=|date=|work=abanet.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New organizations seek to access this under-served [[latent market]] by using technology to reduce prices and make services more available.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info.

===Online legal services===
{{See also|Document automation#In Legal Services|l1=Document automation in legal services}}

The spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies.

====United States====
In 1995, [[FindLaw]] started its online legal information service, where users can search lawyers, discuss legal topics in open forum, and purchase legal forms. In 1999, [[LegalMatch]] started its online legal matching service, where users answer questions online, LegalMatch identify the service required and notifies relevant lawyers, and users receives responses from the lawyers and can decide whom to hire. In 2001, [[LegalZoom]] started its online legal documentation service.  At LegalZoom, users can create legal documents for personal and business use by answering a questionnaire online and purchase the completed document.  In 2008, [[Rocket Lawyer]] started its online legal service, where users can receive legal documentation service and the on-call service to consult lawyers for personal and business needs at monthly or annual subscription fee. In 2012, [[Shake (company)|Shake]] started its mobile legal documentation service, with which users can create simple legal agreements via a mobile app.

====Japan====
In 2005, Taichiro Motoe, an attorney at law qualified in Japan, founded Authense Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.authense.co.jp&lt;/ref&gt; and started its online legal service, Bengoshi.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bengo4.com|title=弁護士ドットコム-無料法律相談・弁護士/法律相談事務所検索ポータル|author=|date=|work=bengo4.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Bengoshi.com, users can search lawyers, ask legal questions and receive answers from lawyers in open forum, request estimate for attorney fees, and consult lawyers for personal and business needs.

===Regulatory barriers to delivery of legal services===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}
Currently available legal technologies and processes cannot be implemented due to various regulations on the practice of law put into place by [[state bar association]]s and state statutes. There is controversy over whether these regulations remain in place due to economic interests by attorneys or out of genuine concern for potential harms to customers. Regulations which pose obstacles to widespread adoption of new legal technologies and processes include [[Unauthorized practice of law#Unauthorized practice of law|unauthorized practice of law]] statutes, ethical rules restricting alternative business structures for law firms, and professional rules which make practicing law in multiple jurisdictions difficult.

====Unauthorized practice of law====
{{Main|Unauthorized_practice_of_law#Unauthorized_practice_of_law}}
[[Layperson|Lay]] organizations seeking to provide legal services must be careful to avoid committing unauthorized practice of law or face exposure to litigation from consumers and regulators. The definition of what constitutes unauthorized practice of law is nebulous and has been criticized as a potentially [[unconstitutional]] restriction on free speech.&lt;ref name="LanctotArticle"&gt;Catherine J Lanctot, "Does LegalZoom have First Amendment Rights? Some Thoughts About Freedom of Speech and the Unauthorized Practice of Law", Villanova Univ. Sch. of L. Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 2011-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative business structures====
{{main|Law_firm#Restrictions_on_ownership_interests}}
In the United States a complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been adopted by the [[American Bar Association]] as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] and has been codified in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer.html Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/selling_law_on_an_open_market/ |title=Selling Law on an Open Market |first=Jason |last=Krause |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]'' |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}} See also: [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter's notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; except the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/rules_of_professional_conduct/amended_rules/rule_five/rule05_04.cfm Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these rules, law firms face additional difficulties in raising equity capital to finance development of their own legal technologies and additional regulatory requirements compared to layperson organizations. Outside of the United States there are several countries which have allowed nonlawyer ownership of law firms ranging from limitations on percentage ownership combined with a "fit to own" test&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"&gt;ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20, Memorandum Re: For Comment: Issues Paper Concerning Alternative Business Structures, 17-19 (April 5, 2011)[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ethics_2020/abs_issues_paper.authcheckdam.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (as in the [[United Kingdom]]) to allowing passive equity investment in law firms&lt;ref name="ABSMemo"/&gt; (as in [[Australia]]).

====Multijurisdictional practice====
Rule 5.5 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires that attorneys who maintain a "systematic and continuous practice" in a jurisdiction be admitted to practice in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="ModelRule5.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_5_unauthorized_practice_of_law_multijurisdictional_practice_of_law.html|title=Rule 5.5: Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=americanbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For law firms that wish to provide legal services over online delivery platforms, this phrase is unclear as to what types of activities within a state require licensing in that state.&lt;ref name="KimbroSlice"&gt;Staphanie L. Kimbro, Regulatory Barriers to the Growth of Multijurisdictional Virtual Law Firms and Potential First Steps to Their Removal, 13 N.C.J.L. &amp; TECH. ON. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty is especially acute for [[virtual law firm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Use of technology for legal access==

===Access to legal information===
From the mid-1990s onwards, lawyers, developers and publishers began to make the law available via the world wide web. Particularly influential{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} was the [[Free Access to Law Movement]] which by 2014 had 54 national and regional member organizations. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind.

The member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the [[Legal Information Institute]] at Cornell University Law School and the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] based at the University of Technology and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Legal_Information_Institutes.htm Legal_Information_Institutes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/austlii/articles/libs_paper.html|title=AustLII - Publications: AustLII - Libs Paper|author=|date=|work=austlii.edu.au|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work of the open access to law movement is now published through the ''Journal of Open Access to Law'', which was established in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojs.law.cornell.edu/index.php/joal|title=Journal of Open Access to Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the movement provided a catalyst for increasing official open access publication of legal information online by government agencies themselves.&lt;ref name="nyulawglobal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austlii.edu.au"/&gt;

===Access to justice===
Lawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;See CodeX Techindex. Stanford Law School, n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://techindex.law.stanford.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT's) Institute of Design and the [[Chicago–Kent College of Law|Chicago-Kent College of Law]] collaborated on a multi-year redesign of self-represented litigants' court experience. Their 2002 report documented their investigation of current assistance systems, creation of a new design protocol, and plan for a new system design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/Documents/Institutes%20and%20Centers/CAJT/access-to-justice-meeting-the-needs.pdf Charles L. Owen, Edward B. Pedwell, and Ronald W. Staudt, "Access to Justice: Meeting the Needs of Self-Represented Litigants", 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also puts forward a number of concept designs, reimagining how the court system may work and people may access it. Some of their proposals include:
* "CourtNet", a network inside the court building, to link together judicial staff and the public;
* "Interactive Translator", a software tool that can be used in interviewing and court exchanges, able to translate verbal and text communications into different languages;
* "Archetypes", a diagnosis platform that models users' legal problems, classifies them, and offers referral services; 
* "Pursuit Evaluator", an online tool to allow potential litigants evaluate whether pursuing a case would be worth their time, money, and effort
* "Complaint Formulator", an electronic interface to let litigants extract data from their problem situation and assemble it into various legal documents;
* "Informer", software that uses sample cases to help litigants model their own forms and teaches them how to file correctly; and
* "Case Tracker", an interactive searchable archive of a litigant's case history, that provides a clear timeline and reference to past actions.

The [[Berkman Center]] at Harvard Law School has been working with Massachusetts housing court judge Dina Fein to design access to civil justice in the state for pro se litigants, low-income people, litigants who aren't proficient in English, and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/6853|title=Technology and Access to Justice - Berkman Klein Center|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, hosts projects such as [[Legal.io]] and [[Ravel Law]], addressing the application of legal informatics to access to justice issues, and convenes a community bringing researchers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and technologists together to work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/|title=CodeX {{!}} Stanford Law School|last=School|first=Stanford Law|website=Stanford Law School|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and policy==
Law and policy issues in legal informatics stem from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of [[subpoenas]] for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world; for example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dolin | first1 = Ron A | year = | title = Search Query Privacy: The Problem of Anonymization | url = | journal = Hastings Science &amp; Technology Law Journal | volume = 2010 | issue = | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights management and copyright law===
Copyright holders make use of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology to limit the use and distribution of digital content. In the United States, the [[anti-circumvention]] provision of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) criminalizes attempts to circumvent DRM, even in cases where the circumvention is merely to facilitate non-infringing uses of the content. Along with the anti-circumvention provision, DRM can override substantive rights, such as [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the Public Library Ethos: Copyright, E-Licensing, and the Future of Librarianship". William M. Cross. ''Law Library Journal'' Vol. 104:2 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal informatics in legal practice===
Within the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbar.org/about/communications/nc-lawyer/2012-nc-lawyer-editions/may-2012/predictivecoding.aspx|title=NC Lawyer by NC Bar Association - NC Bar Association's NC Lawyer|author=|date=|work=ncbar.org|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.&lt;ref&gt;Darryl Mountain, XML E-Contracts: Documents that Describe Themselves, 11(3) INT'L J.L. &amp; TECH. 274 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hunziker |first1=R |date=Feb 2017 |title=New Invention Disclosure Standard – Why Would I Care? |url=http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/New_Invention_Disclosure_Standard.pdf |journal=IPO Law Journal |publisher=[[Intellectual Property Owners Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==

{{main|Applications of artificial intelligence to legal informatics}}

Artificial intelligence is already employed in  [[online dispute resolution]] platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding, and may be employed extensively in the future.&lt;ref&gt;David Allen Larson, "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?" Technology Can Reduce Dispute Resolution Costs When Times Are Tough and Improve Outcomes, 11 Nev. L.J. 523, 550 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal [[ontology]], "an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyner | first1 = A. | year = | title = An Ontology in OWL for Legal Case-Based Reasoning | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence and Law | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 361–387 | doi=10.1007/s10506-008-9070-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative legal prediction==
Both academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4099370 Theodore W. Ruger, Pauline T. Kim, Andrew D. Martin, &amp; Kevin M. Quinn, "The Supreme Court Forecasting Project: Legal and Political Science Approaches to Predicting Supreme Court Decisionmaking" ''Columbia Law Review'' Volume 104 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2012.01260.x | volume=9 | title=Predicting Securities Fraud Settlements and Amounts: A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Federal Securities Class Action Lawsuits | year=2012 | journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies | pages=482–510 | last1 = McShane | first1 = Blakeley B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also there are legal technology startups that are attempting to create proprietary models to predict case outcomes; one example is Lex Machina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexmachina.com/|title=Legal Analytics by Lex Machina|author=|date=|work=lexmachina.com|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company that provides [[intellectual property]] data and analytics.

==Criminal law==
In 1995, Peter W. Martin's paper for the NCAIR Sponsored Program on the Future of Legal Information Technology, entitled "Digital Law: Some Speculations on the Future of Legal Information Technology", wondered how innovations in technology were shaping—and would shape—legal information flow, storage, and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/papers/fut95fnl.htm|title=Digital Law|author=|date=|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Martin was wondering how technology would change the fundamental nature and practice of the legal field in the United States. Martin wrote that "There is a powerful (but infrequently noticed) linkage between ways societies think about law and the technology they use in operation and distribution of it (law that is)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was writing shortly after launching the Legal Information Institute at Cornell, the first law server on the Internet. LEXIS had pioneered putting digital legal content on computers twenty-four years prior, and digital content then accounted for more than 50% of the legal information market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin asked readers to suspend their disbelief as he proposed relatively rapid shifts in the ratio of paper-based legal information to digital legal information; the power wielded by the information-seeking public vs. high-priced gatekeepers of legal information; and a shift away from the private sector as a means to basic legal data and towards more higher-level skill sets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Martin suggested "fuller" bodies of data, pointing to a case in which the court thoroughly discussed a restaurant's trademark decor without ever showing a picture of the decor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Martin also highlights the Penalty Statistics Database in use in sentencing in New South Wales, and comparing it to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines of the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The South Wales model, launched in 1990, allows judges access not only to both more traditional legal data, including statutory provisions and appellate decisions but also to the availability of alternate facilities (such as drug rehabilitation programs).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The "Penalty Statistics Database" furthermore gives judges access to a pre-analyzed data pool of sentencing decisions made by other sentencing officers in New South Wales, as well as full offense and offender information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this suggestion, too, Martin emphasizes the Penalty Statistics Database's use of graphical display to make the information it is transmitting to judges easier to access and utilize.

Treating legal informatics as a field as a serious tool for changing the way people interact with the law may pave the way for radical innovations in areas of law that are seen as inherently static, top-down, and bureaucratic.

==In corporate legal departments==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2016}}Today's corporate legal departments are entities which can be as large as the biggest law firms. As such, the usage of different legal informatics technologies is important for their success. Legal departments use among other: various technology aids to manage their document databases, and more advanced assets such as patent portfolios. Some legal departments are also experimenting with the automation of certain types of tasks performed by in-house attorneys in their day-to-day practice. These tasks include: preparation of documents, editing and customization of these documents and the management of signatures.

==Corporate governance==
The prevailing [[corporate governance]] [[paradigm]], especially when [[public company|public companies]] are concerned, is largely based on the notion of the relative [[efficiency]] of separating ownership and control in managing business [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"&gt;''See'' Stephen M. Bainbridge, ''The Case for Limited Shareholder Voting Rights'', 53 UCLA L. Rev 601 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[technological change]] can affect the [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] of optimal governance structure for individual [[firm]]s. For instance, by lowering the cost of both disseminating [[information]] to [[shareholder]]s and gathering [[data]] about their [[preference]]s, developments in [[communication technology]] can potentially make it preferable for some firms to organize the [[management]] of the firm in a manner more similar to, for example, [[direct democracy]], with features such as [[two-way communication]] between the company's [[senior management]] and its [[investor]]s. The study of such questions thus applies legal informatics to analyzing the relationship between [[technology]] and [[corporate governance]] structures.

The concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist [[Arnold van Gennep]] and later taken up by [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liminality and Communitas", in "The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure" (New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites.&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, ''The Uses and Meanings of Liminality'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Horvath, Bjørn Thomassen, and Harald Wydra, ''Introduction: Liminality and Cultures of Change'' (International Political Anthropology 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established.&lt;ref&gt;Arpad Szakolczai, ''Liminality and Experience: Structuring transitory situations and transformative events'' (International Political Anthropology 2009) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also passed into popular usage, where it is applied much more broadly, undermining its significance to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The Dictionary of Anthropology'' (1997) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites of passage==

===Arnold van Gennep===

Van Gennep, who coined the term liminality, published in 1909 his 'Rites de Passage', a work that explores and develops the concept of liminality in the context of rites in small-scale societies. Van Gennep began his book by identifying the various categories of rites. He distinguished between those that result in a change of status for an individual or social group, and those that signify transitions in the passage of time. In doing so, he placed a particular emphasis on [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], and claimed that "such rituals marking, helping, or celebrating individual or collective passages through the cycle of life or of nature exist in every culture, and share a specific three-fold sequential structure".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

This three-fold structure, as established by van Gennep, is made up of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold van Gennep, ''The Rites of Passage'' (London 1977) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''preliminal rites'' (or ''rites of separation''): This stage involves a metaphorical "death", as the initiate is forced to leave something behind by breaking with previous practices and routines.
* ''liminal rites'' (or ''transition rites''): Two characteristics are essential to these rites. First, the rite "must follow a strictly prescribed sequence, where everybody knows what to do and how".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Second, everything must be done "under the authority of a master of ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The destructive nature of this rite allows for considerable changes to be made to the identity of the initiand. This middle stage (when the transition takes place) "implies an actual passing through the threshold that marks the boundary between two phases, and the term 'liminality' was introduced in order to characterize this passage."&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 141&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''postliminal rites'' (or ''rites of incorporation''): During this stage, the initiand is re-incorporated into society with a new identity, as a "new" being.

Turner confirmed his nomenclature for 'the three phases of passage from one culturally defined state or status to another...''preliminal'', ''liminal'', and ''postliminal'''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor W. Turner, ''The Ritual Process'' (Penguin 1969) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this structural template, Van Gennep also suggested four categories of rites that emerge as universal across cultures and societies. He suggested that there are four types of social rites of passage that are replicable and recognizable among many ethnographic populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

* Passage of people from one status to another, initiation ceremonies in which an outsider is brought into the group. This includes marriage and initiation ceremonies that move one from the status of an outsider to an insider.
* Passage from one place to another, such as moving houses, moving to a new city, etc.
* Passage from one situation to another: beginning university, starting a new job, and graduating high school or university.
* Passage of time such as New Year celebrations and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2015-01-01|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last1=Andrews|first1=Hazel|last2=Roberts|first2=Les|isbn=9780080970875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gennep considered rites of [[initiation]] to be the most typical rite. To gain a better understanding of "tripartite structure" of liminal situations, one can look at a specific rite of initiation: the initiation of youngsters into adulthood, which Turner considered the most typical rite. In such rites of passage, the experience is highly structured. The first phase (the rite of separation) requires the child to go through a separation from his family; this involves his/her "death" as a child, as [[childhood]] is effectively left behind. In the second stage, initiands (between childhood and adulthood) must pass a "test" to prove they are ready for adulthood. If they succeed, the third stage (incorporation) involves a celebration of the "new birth" of the adult and a welcoming of that being back into society.

By constructing this three-part sequence, van Gennep identified a pattern he believed was inherent in all ritual passages. By suggesting that such a sequence is universal (meaning that all societies use rites to demarcate transitions), van Gennep made an important claim (one that not many anthropologists make, as they generally tend to demonstrate [[cultural diversity]] while shying away from universality).

An anthropological rite, especially a [[rite of passage]], involves some change to the participants, especially their [[social status]].;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner, "Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites de Passage", in ''The Forest of Symbols'' (Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 'the first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual...from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Their status thus becomes liminal. In such a liminal situation, "the initiands live outside their normal environment and are brought to question their self and the existing social order through a series of rituals that often involve acts of pain: the initiands come to feel nameless, spatio-temporally dislocated and socially unstructured".&lt;ref&gt;Bjørn Thomassen, "Liminality" in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Theory''(London 2006) p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, liminal periods are "destructive" as well as "constructive", meaning that "the formative experiences during liminality will prepare the initiand (and his/her cohort) to occupy a new social role or status, made public during the reintegration rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victor Turner===

Turner, who is considered to have "re-discovered the importance of liminality", first came across van Gennep's work in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he published his book ''The Forest of Symbols'', which included an essay entitled ''Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period in Rites of Passage''. Within the works of Turner, liminality began to wander away from its narrow application to ritual passages in small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the various works he completed while conducting his fieldwork amongst the Ndembu in [[Zambia]], he made numerous connections between [[Tribe|tribal]] and non-tribal societies, "sensing that what he argued for the Ndembu had relevance far beyond the specific [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] context".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt; He became aware that liminality "...served not only to identify the importance of in-between periods, but also to understand the human reactions to liminal experiences: the way liminality shaped personality, the sudden foregrounding of agency, and the sometimes dramatic tying together of thought and experience".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'The attributes of liminality or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''Ritual'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; One's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]] dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation, but also the possibility of new perspectives. Turner posits that, if liminality is regarded as a time and place of withdrawal from normal modes of social action, it potentially can be seen as a period of scrutiny for central values and axioms of the culture where it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Ritual'' p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;—one where normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are undone. In such situations, "the very structure of society [is] temporarily suspended"&lt;ref&gt;Szakolczai 2009, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'According to Turner, all liminality must eventually dissolve, for it is a state of great intensity that cannot exist very long without some sort of structure to stabilize it...either the individual returns to the surrounding social structure...or else liminal communities develop their own internal social structure, a condition Turner calls "normative communitas"'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Homas, ''Jung in Context'' (London 1979) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Victor Turner has vital significance in turning attention to this concept, introduced by Arnold van Gennep, a main intellectual opponent of [[Durkheim]], who subsequently was diverted out of anthropological and sociological thinking. However, Turner's approach to liminality has two major shortcomings. First, partly due to criticism, Turner was  keen to limit the meaning of the concept to the concrete settings of small-scale tribal societies, preferring the neologism coined by him, 'liminoid', to analyse certain features of the modern world, like theatre (Turner 1982). However, Agnes Horvath (2013) argues that the term can be applied to concrete historical events, and should be applied, as offering a vital means for historical and sociological understanding.  Second, again staying too close to his own experiences, Turner attributed a rather univocally positive connotation to liminal situations, as ways of renewal. However, liminal situations can be, and in actual fact in modern era, rather quite different: periods of uncertainty, anguish, even existential fear: a facing of the abyss in void.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath, Agnes. ''Modernism and Charisma''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, Macmillan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Liminality has both spatial and temporal dimensions, and can be applied to a variety of subjects: individuals, larger groups (cohorts or villages), whole societies, and possibly even entire civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt; The following chart summarizes the different dimensions and subjects of liminal experiences, and also provides the main characteristics and key examples of each category.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Another significant variable is "scale," or the "degree" to which an individual or group experiences liminality.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 17&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "there are degrees of liminality, and…the degree depends on the extent to which the liminal experience can be weighed against persisting structures."&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt; When the spatial and temporal are both affected, the intensity of the liminal experience increases and so-called "pure liminality" is approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In large-scale societies==

The concept of a liminal situation can also be applied to entire societies that are going through a crisis or a "collapse of order".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] made a significant contribution to this idea through his concept of the "[[axial age]]", which was "an in-between period between two structured world-views and between two rounds of empire building; it was an age of creativity where 'man asked radical questions', and where the 'unquestioned grasp on life is loosened'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; It was essentially a time of uncertainty which, most importantly, involved entire civilizations. Seeing as liminal periods are both destructive and constructive, the ideas and practices that emerge from these liminal historical periods are of extreme importance, as they will "tend to take on the quality of structure".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Events such as political or social revolutions (along with other periods of crisis) can thus be considered liminal, as they result in the complete collapse of order and can lead to significant social change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2006, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality in large-scale societies differs significantly from liminality found in ritual passages in small-scale societies. One primary characteristic of liminality (as defined van Gennep and Turner) is that there is a way in as well as a way out.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In ritual passages, "members of the society are themselves aware of the liminal state: they know that they will leave it sooner or later, and have 'ceremony masters' to guide them through the rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, in those liminal periods that affect society as a whole, the future (what comes after the liminal period) is completely unknown, and there is no "ceremony master" who has gone through the process before and that can lead people out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, liminal situations can become dangerous. They allow for the emergence of "self-proclaimed ceremony masters", that assume leadership positions and attempt to "[perpetuate] liminality and by emptying the liminal moment of real creativity, [turn] it into a scene of mimetic rivalry".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth psychology==
Jungians have often seen the [[individuation]] process of self-realization as taking place within a liminal space.  'Individuation begins with a withdrawal from normal modes of socialisation, epitomized by the breakdown of the persona...liminality'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans 1979, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "what Turner's concept of social liminality does for status in society, Jung...does for the movement of the person through the life process of individuation".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, quoted in Miller and Jung 2004, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation can be seen as a "movement through liminal space and time, from disorientation to integration....What takes place in the dark phase of liminality is a process of breaking down...in the interest of "making whole" one's meaning, purpose and sense of relatedness once more'"&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 73, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] figure, "the trickster is a symbol of the liminal state itself, and of its permanent accessibility as a source of recreative power".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pelton in Young-Eisendrath and Dawson eds. 1997, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

But other depth psychologies speak of a similar process.  [[Carl Rogers]] describes "the 'out-of-this-world' quality that many therapists have remarked upon, a sort of trance-like feeling in the relationship that client and therapist emerge from at the end of the hour, as if from a deep well or tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1961, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The French talk of how the analytic setting 'opens/forges the "intermediate space," "excluded middle," or "between" that figures so importantly in [[Irigaray]]'s writing".&lt;ref&gt;E. Hirsh, in Burke et al. eds. 1994, 309n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Milner]] claimed that "a temporal spatial frame also marks off the special kind of reality of a psycho-analytic session...the different kind of reality that is within it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Casement 1997, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungians however have perhaps been most explicit about the 'need to accord space, time and place for liminal feeling'&lt;ref&gt;Shorter 1988, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well about the associated dangers, 'two mistakes: we provide no ritual space at all in our lives...or we stay in it too long'.&lt;ref&gt;Bly, 1991, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jung's psychology has itself been described as 'a form of "permanent liminality" in which there is no need to return to social structure'.&lt;ref&gt;Homans  1979, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of general usage==
 {{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}

===In rites===
In the context of rites, liminality is being artificially produced, as opposed to those situations (such as natural disasters) in which it can occur spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In the simple example of a college [[graduation]] ceremony, the liminal phase can actually be extended to include the period of time between when the last assignment was finished (and graduation was assured) all the way through reception of the diploma. That [[no man's land]] represents the limbo associated with liminality. The stress of accomplishing tasks for college has been lifted, yet the individual has not moved on to a new stage in life (psychologically or physically). The result is a unique perspective on what has come before, and what may come next.

It can include the period between when a couple get engaged and their marriage or between death and burial, for which cultures may have set ritual observances. Even sexually liberal cultures may strongly disapprove of an engaged spouse having sex with another person during this time. When a marriage proposal is initiated there is a liminal stage between the question and the answer during which the social arrangements of both parties involved are subject to transformation and inversion; a sort of "life stage limbo" so to speak in that the affirmation or denial can result in multiple and diverse outcomes.

Getz&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; provides commentary on the liminal/liminoid zone when discussing the planned event experience. He refers to a liminal zone at an event as the creation of "time out of time: a special place". He notes that this liminal zone is both spatial and temporal and integral when planning a successful event (e.g. ceremony, concert, conference etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Getz 2007, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In time===
The temporal dimension of liminality can relate to moments (sudden events), periods (weeks, months, or possibly years), and epochs (decades, generations, maybe even centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
====Examples====
[[Twilight]] serves as a liminal time, between day and night—where one is 'in the twilight zone, in a liminal nether region of the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Costello 2002, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the television fiction series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' makes reference to this, describing it as "the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition" in one variant of the original series' opening. The name is from an actual zone observable from space in the place where daylight or shadow advances or retreats about the Earth.  [[Noon]] and, more often, [[midnight]] can be considered liminal, the first transitioning between morning and afternoon, the latter between days.

Within the years, liminal times include [[equinox]]es when day and night have equal length, and [[solstice]]s, when the increase of day or night shifts over to its decrease.  Where the [[quarter days]] are held to mark the change in seasons, they also are liminal times. [[New Year's Day]], whatever its connection or lack of one to the astrological sky, is a liminal time.  Customs such as fortune-telling take advantage of this liminal state.  In a number of cultures, actions and events on the first day of the year can determine the year, leading to such beliefs as [[first-foot]].  Many cultures regard it as a time especially prone to hauntings by [[ghost]]s—[[liminal being]]s, neither alive nor dead.

===In religion===

====Christian worship====

Liminal existence can be located in a separated ''sacred space'', which occupies a ''sacred time''.  Examples in the Bible include the dream of Jacob ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12–19) where he encounters God between heaven and earth and the instance when [[Isaiah]] meets the Lord in the [[temple of holiness]] ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 6:1–6).&lt;ref&gt;Carson, 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a liminal space, the individual experiences the revelation of ''sacred knowledge'' where God imparts his knowledge on the person.

Worship can be understood in this context as the church community (or ''communitas'' or ''[[koinonia]]'') enter into liminal space corporately.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2003, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious symbols and music may aid in this process described as a [[pilgrimage]] by way of [[prayer]], [[song]], or [[liturgical]] acts.  The congregation is transformed in the liminal space and as they exit, are sent out back into the world to serve.

===Of beings===
Various minority groups can be considered liminal. In reality illegal immigrants (present but not "official"), and stateless people, for example, are regarded as liminal because they are "betwixt and between home and host, part of society, but sometimes never fully integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex]] or [[transgender]] people, [[bisexual]] people in most contemporary societies, people of mixed [[ethnicity]], and those accused but not yet judged guilty or not guilty, are liminal. Teenagers, being neither children nor adults, are liminal people: indeed, "for young people, liminality of this kind has become a permanent phenomenon...Postmodern liminality".&lt;ref&gt;Kahane 1997, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[trickster]] as the mythic projection of the magician—standing in the ''limen'' between the sacred realm and the profane"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2009, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and related [[archetype]]s embody many such contradictions as do many [[popular culture]] [[celebrities]]. The category could also hypothetically and in [[fiction]] include [[cyborg]]s, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two species, [[shapeshifter]]s. One could also consider seals, crabs, shorebirds, frogs, bats, dolphins/whales and other "border animals" to be liminal: "the wild duck and swan are cases in point...intermediate creatures that combine underwater activity and the bird flight with an intermediate, terrestrial life".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson in Jung 1978, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It should come as no surprise that these liminal creatures figure prominently in mythology as shapeshifters and spirit guides.

===In places===
The spatial dimension of liminality can include specific places, larger zones or areas, or entire countries and larger regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen 2009, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Liminal places can range from [[border]]s and frontiers to no man's lands and [[disputed territories]], to [[crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] to perhaps [[airport]]s or [[hotel]]s, which people pass through but do not live in: arguably indeed all 'romantic travel enacts the three stages that characterize liminality: separation, marginalization, and reaggregation'.&lt;ref&gt; Illouz 1997, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mythology]] and [[religion]] or [[occult|esoteric lore]] liminality can include such realms as [[Purgatory]] or [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'at]], which, as well as signifying liminality, some theologians deny actually existing, making them, in some cases, doubly liminal. "Between-ness" defines these spaces. For a hotel worker (an insider) or a person passing by with disinterest (a total outsider), the hotel would have a very different connotation. To a traveller staying there, the hotel would function as a liminal zone, just as 'doors and windows and hallways and gates frame...the definitively liminal condition'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

More conventionally, springs, caves, shores, rivers, volcanic calderas—'a huge crater of an extinct volcano...[as] another symbol of transcendence'&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, in Jung 1978, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;—fords, passes, crossroads, bridges, and marshes are all liminal: '"edges", borders or faultlines between the legitimate and the illegitimate'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown in Corcoran 2002, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus (an adoptee and therefore liminal) met his father at the crossroads and killed him; the bluesman [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] met the devil at the crossroads, where he is said to have sold his soul. Major transformations occur at crossroads and other liminal places, at least partly because liminality—being so unstable—can pave the way for access to esoteric knowledge or understanding of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;El Khoury, 2015, 217&lt;/ref&gt; Liminality is sacred, alluring, and dangerous.

In contemporary culture viewing the nightclub experience (dancing in a [[nightclub]]) through the liminoid framework highlights the 'presence or absence of opportunities for social subversion, escape from social structures, and exercising choice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows 'insights into what may be effectively improved in hedonic spaces. Enhancing the consumer experience of these liminoid aspects may heighten experiential feelings of escapism and play, thus encouraging the consumer to more freely consume'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Gori|first2=Keith|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Hogg|first4=Gillian|last5=Farrington|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-02|title=Experiential liminoid consumption: the case of nightclubbing|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=32|issue=1–2|pages=19–43|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1089309|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In folklore===
There are a number of stories in [[folklore]] of those who could only be killed in a liminal space: [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes|Lleu]] could not be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, nor riding or walking, nor clothed or naked (and is attacked at dusk, while wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat). Likewise, in [[Hindu]] text [[Bhagavat Purana]], [[Vishnu]] appears in a half-man half-[[lion]] form named [[Narasimha]] to destroy the demon Hiranyakashipu who has obtained the power never to be killed in day nor night, in the ground nor in the air, with [[weapon]] nor by bare hands, in a building nor outside it, by man nor beast.  Narasimha kills Hiranyakashipu at dusk, across his lap, with his sharp claws, on the threshold of the palace, and as Narasimha is a god himself, the demon is killed by neither man nor beast. In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Indra]] promises not to slay [[Namuci]] and [[Vritra]] with anything wet or dry, nor in the day or in the night, but instead kills them at dusk with foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Vritra |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA/Gale Group |year=2006 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/Vritra |accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another example comes from Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke" in which the Forest Spirit can only be killed while switching between its two forms.

===In ethnographic research===
In ethnographic research, 'the researcher is...in a liminal state, separated from his own culture yet not incorporated into the host culture'&lt;ref&gt;Norris Johnson, in Robben and Sluka 2007, 76&lt;/ref&gt;—when he or she is both participating in the culture ''and'' observing the culture. The researcher must consider the self in relation to others and his or her positioning in the culture being studied.

In many cases, greater participation in the group being studied can lead to increased access of cultural information and greater in-group understanding of experiences within the culture. However increased participation also blurs the role of the researcher in data collection and analysis. Often a researcher that engages in fieldwork as a "participant" or "participant-observer" occupies a liminal state where he/she is a part of the culture, but also separated from the culture as a researcher. This liminal state of being betwixt and between is emotional and uncomfortable as the researcher uses self-reflexivity to interpret field observations and interviews.

Some scholars argue that ethnographers are present in their research, occupying a liminal state, regardless of their participant status. Justification for this position is that the researcher as a "human instrument" engages with his/her observations in the process of recording and analyzing the data. A researcher, often unconsciously, selects what to observe, how to record observations and how to interpret observations based on personal reference points and experiences. For example, even in selecting what observations are interesting to record, the researcher must interpret and value the data available. To explore the liminal state of the researcher in relation to the culture, self-reflexivity and awareness are important tools to reveal researcher bias and interpretation.

===In popular culture===
====Novels and short stories====

''[[Rant (novel)|Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey]]'' is a US novel by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] from 2007 that makes use of liminality in explaining time travel. ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' is  a romance by A. S. Byatt, which describes how [[postmodern]] 'Literary theory. Feminism...write about liminality. Thresholds. Bastions. Fortresses'.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt 1990, 505–06.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Twilight (novel series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' is a book series by Stephanie Meyer that was turned into film series. Each book title speaks of a liminal period (''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]], [[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]], [[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'', and ''[[Breaking Dawn]]''). In the children's story ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' (1961), Milo enters "The Lands Beyond", a liminal place (which explains its topsy-turvy nature), through a magical tollbooth. When he finishes his quest, he returns, but changed, seeing the world differently. The giver of the tollbooth is never seen and name never known, and hence, also remains liminal. In ''[[Offshore (novel)|Offshore]]'', a British novel by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], the characters live between sea and land on docked boats, becoming liminal people; as such, liminality is a major theme in the novel. [[Saul Bellow|Bellow]]'s varied uses of liminality...include his ''[[Dangling Man]]'', suspended between civilian life and the armed forces'&lt;ref&gt;Elsbree 1991, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; at 'the onset of the dangling days'.&lt;ref&gt;Bellow 1977, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Brönte's widely-read ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' follows the protagonist through different stages of life as she crosses the threshold from student to teacher to woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brontë, Charlotte (1816–1855)|volume = 1|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.3523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her existence throughout the novel is liminal and can first be seen when she hides herself behind a large red curtain to read, closing herself off physically and existing in a paracosmic realm. At Gateshead, Jane is noted to be set apart and on the outside of the family, putting her in a liminal space in which she neither belongs nor is completely cast away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Megan|date=2017|title=The Space In-Between: Exploring Liminality in Jane Eyre|url=|journal=Criterion: A Journal of Literary Criticism|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane's existence emerges as paradoxical as she transcends commonly accepted beliefs about what it means to be a woman, orphan, child, victim, criminal, and pilgrim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creates her own narrative as she is torn from her past and denied a sure future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a series of crises, Jane's circumstances question social constructs and allow Jane to act to progress or retract; as a result, a narrative dynamic of structure and liminality (as coined by Turner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilead|first=Sarah|date=1987|title=Liminality and Antiliminality in Charlotte Brontë's Novels: Shirley Reads Jane Eyre|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=29|issue=3|pages=302–322|jstor=40754831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Karen Brooks states that Australian [[grunge lit]] books, such as Clare Mendes'  ''[[Drift Street]]'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and [[Andrew McGahan]]'s ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "liminal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an [[abjection|abject]] human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that Berridge's short stories provide "...a variety of violent, disaffected and often abject young people", characters who "...blur and often overturn" the boundaries between suburban and urban space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "liminality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brooks states that the story "Caravan Park" in Berridge's short story collection is an example of a story with a "liminal" setting, as it is set in a [[mobile home]] park; since mobile homes can be relocated, she states that setting a story in a mobile home "...has the potential to disrupt a range of geo-physical and psycho-social boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that in Berridge's story "Bored Teenagers", the adolescents using a community drop-in centre decide to destroy its equipment and defile the space by urinating in it, thus "altering the dynamics of the place and the way" their bodies are perceived, with their destructive activities being deemed by Brooks to indicate the community centre's "loss of authority" over the teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plays====
''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', a play by [[Tom Stoppard]], takes place both in a kind of no-man's-land and the actual setting of ''[[Hamlet]]''. "Shakespeare's play ''Hamlet'' is in several ways an essay in sustained liminality ... only via a condition of complete liminality can Hamlet finally see the way forward".&lt;ref&gt;Liebler, pp. 182–84&lt;/ref&gt; In the play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' for the entire length of the play, two men walk around restlessly on an empty stage. They alternate between hope and hopelessness.  At times one forgets what they are even waiting for, and the other reminds him: "We are waiting for Godot". The identity of 'Godot' is never revealed, and perhaps the men do not know Godot's identity. The men are trying to keep up their spirits as they wander the empty stage, waiting.

====Films and TV shows====
''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959–2003) is a US television anthology series that explores unusual situations between reality and the paranormal.  ''[[The Terminal (film)|The Terminal]]'' (2004), is a US film in which the main character (Viktor Navorski) is trapped in a liminal space; since he can neither legally return to his home country Krakozhia nor enter the United States, he must remain in the airport terminal indefinitely until he finds a way out at the end of the film. In the film ''[[Waking Life]]'', about dreams, Aklilu Gebrewold talks about liminality.

====Music and other media====
"Liminal Space" is an album by American [[breakcore]] artist Xanopticon. [[Coil (band)|Coil]] mention liminality throughout their works, most explicitly with the title of their song "Batwings (A Limnal Hymn)" ''(sic)'' from their album [[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2]]. In ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' where Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the MMORPG "The World", attempted to bring the real world into the online world, creating a hazy barrier between the two worlds; a concept called "Liminality".

==Liminoid experiences==
In 1974, Victor Turner coined the term ''liminoid'' (from the greek word eidos, meaning "form or shape"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Liminality|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868121026|language=en|pages=131–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.12102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to experiences that have characteristics of liminal experiences but are optional and do not involve a resolution of a personal crisis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Turner, Victor. 'Liminal to liminoid in play, flow, and ritual: An essay in comparative symbology'. ''Rice University Studies'' 1974. 60(3):53–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike liminal events, liminoid experiences are conditional and do not result in a change of status, but merely serve as transitional moments in time&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/63159/article_RIP603_part4.pdf|title=LIMINAL TO LIMINOID, IN PLAY, FLOW, AND
RITUAL: AN ESSAY IN COMPARATIVE SYMBOLOGY|last=Turner|first=Victor|date=|website=Rice Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/25/18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The liminal is part of society, an aspect of social or religious rites, while the liminoid is a break from society, part of "play" or "playing". With the rise in industrialization and the emergence of leisure as an acceptable form of play separate from work, liminoid experiences have become much more common than liminal rites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In these modern societies, rites are diminished and 'forged the concept of "liminoid" rituals for analogous but secular phenomena' such as attending rock concerts and other&lt;ref&gt; Illouz, ''Consuming'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; liminoid experiences.

The fading of liminal stages in exchange for liminoid experiences is marked by the shift in culture from tribal and agrarian to modern and industrial. In these societies, work and play are entirely separate whereas in more archaic societies, they are nearly indistinguishable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the past play was interwoven with the nature of work as symbolic gestures and rites in order to promote fertility, abundance, and the passage of certain liminal phases; thus, work and play are inseparable and often dependent on social rites&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Examples of this include Cherokee and Mayan riddles, trickster tales, sacred ball games, and joking relationships which serve holy purposes of work in liminal situations while retaining the element of playfulness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ritual and myth were, in the past, exclusively connected to collective work that served holy and often symbolic purposes; liminal rites were held in the form of coming-of-age ceremonies, celebrations of seasons, and more. Industrialization cut the cord between work and the sacred, putting "work" and "play" in separate boxes that rarely, if ever, intersected. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a famous essay regarding the shift to liminal to liminoid in industrial society, Turner offers a twofold explanation of this sect. First, society began to move away from activities concerning collective ritual obligations, placing more emphasis on the individual than the community; this led to more choice in activities, with many such as work and leisure becoming optional. Second, the work done to earn a living became entirely separate from his or her other activities so that it is "no longer natural, but arbitrary."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simpler terms, the industrial revolution brought about free time that had not existed in past societies and created space for liminoid experiences to exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Types of Liminoid Experiences ===

==== Sports ====
Sporting events such as the Olympics, NFL football games, and hockey matches are forms of liminoid experiences. They are optional activities of leisure that place both the spectator and the competitor in in-between places outside of society's norms. Sporting events also create a sense of community among fans and reinforces the collective spirit of those who take part.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RIOZwUzy0vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=liminoid&amp;ots=AQGD79gCAS&amp;sig=kfUSHa6p5gBzA_n3vZAnIhIPc9A#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Victor Turner and Contemporary Cultural Performance|last=John|first=Graham St|date=2008-04-01|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857450371|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homecoming football games, gymnastics meets, modern baseball games, and swim meets all qualify as liminoid and follow a seasonal schedule; therefore, the flow of sports becomes cyclical and predictable, reinforcing the liminal qualities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Flying ====
Airplane travel is inherently liminoid-suspended in the sky, neither here nor there and crossing thresholds of time and space, it is difficult to make sense of the experience of flying.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Alexandra G.|date=2002-10|title=Organizational Politics of Place and Space: The Perpetual Liminoid Performance of Commercial Flight|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10462930208616175|journal=Text and Performance Quarterly|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=297–316|doi=10.1080/10462930208616175|issn=1046-2937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights shift our existence into a limbo space in which movement becomes an accepted set of cultural performances aimed at convincing us that air travel is a reflection of reality rather than a separation from it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''''' ({{lang-it|Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori}}), also known as '''''The Lives''''' ({{lang-it|Le Vite}}), is a series of artist biographies written by 16th-century [[List of Italian painters|Italian painter]] and [[architect]] [[Giorgio Vasari]], which is considered "perhaps the most famous, and even today the most-read work of the older literature of art",&lt;ref name=Gombrich&gt;[http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=18 Max Marmor, ''Kunstliteratur'', translated by [[Ernst Gombrich]], in Art Documentation Vol 11 # 1, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; "some of the Italian Renaissance's most influential writing on art",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webprod1.leeds.ac.uk/banner/dynmodules.asp?Y=200708&amp;M=ITAL-3223 |title=University of Leeds website |publisher=Webprod1.leeds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the first important book on [[history of art|art history]]".&lt;ref name=mur&gt;[[Peter Murray (art historian)|Murray, P.]] and L. Murray. (1963) ''The art of the renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 8. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is often abridged to just the ''Vite'' or the ''Lives''.

It was first published in two editions with substantial differences between them; the first in 1550 and the second in 1568 (which is the one usually translated and referred to).  One important change was the increased attention paid to Venetian art in the second edition, even though Vasari has still been criticised ever since for an excessive emphasis on the art of his native [[Florence]].

==Background==
As the first Italian art historian, Vasari initiated the genre of an encyclopedia of artistic biographies that continues today. Vasari's work was first published in 1550 by [[Lorenzo Torrentino]] in [[Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/arth-technology/arth-technology2.html |title=Christopher Witcombe, Art History and Technology |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. It included a valuable treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. It was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568 and provided with woodcut [[portraits]] of artists (some conjectural).

The work has a consistent and notorious favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the new developments in Renaissance art—for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular, let alone other parts of Europe, is systematically ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangensha.co.jp/allbooks/index/197E.htm |title=Takuma Ito, Studies of Western Art No. 12, July 2007 |publisher=Sangensha.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between his first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]) without achieving a neutral point of view. [[John Addington Symonds|John Symonds]] claimed in 1899 that, "It is clear that Vasari often wrote with carelessness, confusing dates and places, and taking no pains to verify the truth of his assertions" (in regards to Vasari's life of [[Nicola Pisano]]), while acknowledging that, despite these shortcomings, it is one of the basic sources for information on the Renaissance in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/Renaissance-in-Italy-Vol-32.html |title=John Addington Symonds, '&amp;#39;Renaissance in Italy,'&amp;#39; 1899, Vol. 3, Part 2 |publisher=Fullbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, although likely inventions. Others are generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter [[Apelles]]. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and the immediately preceding one. Modern criticism—with all the new materials opened up by research—has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. The work is widely considered a classic even today, though it is widely agreed that it must be supplemented by modern scientific research.

Vasari includes a forty-two-page sketch of his own biography at the end of his ''Vite'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi]].

==Influence==
Vasari's ''Vite'' has been described as "by far the most influential single text for the history of Renaissance art"&lt;ref&gt;[http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/graduate_studies/synopses.htm Professor Hope, The [[Warburg Institute]], course synopsis, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001719/http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/graduate_studies/synopses.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most important work of Renaissance biography of artists".&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Renaissance artists from Italy.

The ''Vite'' has been translated wholly or partially into many languages, including English, Dutch, German, Spanish, French and Russian.

===Early translations became a model for others===
The ''Vite'' formed a model for encyclopedias of artist biographies. Different 17th century translators became artist biographers in their own country of origin and were often called the ''Vasari'' of their country. [[Karel Van Mander]] was probably the first Vasarian author with his ''Painting book'' (''Het Schilderboeck'', 1604), which encompassed not only the first Dutch translation of Vasari, but also the first Dutch translation of Ovid and was accompanied by a list of Italian painters who appeared on the scene after Vasari, and the first comprehensive list of biographies of painters from the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; Similarly, [[Joachim von Sandrart]], author of  ''Deutsche Akademie'' (1675), became known as the "German Vasari" and Antonio Palomino, author of ''[[An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects]]'' (1724), became the "Spanish Vasari".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_library_the_transactions_of_the_bibliographical_society/v007/7.4meurer.html |title=Abstract from the transactions of the bibliographical society |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[William Aglionby|Aglionby]]'s ''Painting Illustrated'' from 1685 was largely based on Vasari as well.&lt;ref name=Gombrich/&gt; In Florence the biographies of artists were revised and implemented in the late 17th century by [[Filippo Baldinucci]].

===View of the Renaissance===
The ''Vite'' is also important as the basis for discussions about the development of style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=302111100893994 Elinor Richter, reviewing Philip Sohms study of style in the art theory] :"Giorgio Vasari's Vite, the first edition of which was published in 1550, provides the foundation for any discussion of the development of style."&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the view art historians had of the Early Renaissance for a long time, placing too much emphasis on the achievements of Florentine and Roman artists while ignoring those of the rest of Italy and certainly the artists from the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/renaissance_quarterly/v060/60.1leone.html Stephanie Leone, The Renaissance Society of America, 2007]: "[...] the traditional definition of Renaissance art as the humanistic innovations of Florentine and Roman artists, to which Giorgio Vasari's Vite (1550, 1568) gave rise."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of information===
For centuries, it has been the most important source of information on [[Early Renaissance]] Italian (and especially [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]) painters and the attribution of their paintings. In 1899, [[John Addington Symonds]] used the ''Vite'' as one of his basic sources for the description of artists in his seven books on the ''Renaissance in Italy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-h/11559-h.htm |title=Full text of John Symonds' "Renaissance in Italy" |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays it is still, despite its obvious biases and shortcomings, the basis for the biographies of many artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3456 |title=Bernard Barryte, The life of Leonardo da Vinci, University of Rochester Library Bulletin (1984) |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The ''Vite'' contains the biographies of many important Italian artists, and is also adopted as a sort of classical reference guide for their names, which are sometimes used in different ways. The following list respects the order of the book, as divided into its three parts. The book starts with a dedication to [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] and a preface, and then starts with technical and background texts about architecture, sculpture, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; A second preface follows, introducing the actual "Vite" in parts 2 to 5. What follows is the complete list from the second (1568) edition. In a few cases, different very short biographies were given in one section.

This design, first used in radiotelegraphy stations in the early 1900s, is commonly used for [[Transmitter|transmitting]] antennas operating at low [[Frequency|frequencies]], in the [[Very low frequency|VLF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] and [[Mediumwave|MF]] ranges, in particular those used for AM [[broadcasting]]. The metal mast is electrically connected to the [[transmitter]]. Its base is usually mounted on a nonconductive support to insulate it from the ground.  A mast radiator is a form of [[monopole antenna]].

==Design considerations==
===Design===
[[Image:Radio antenna mast bonding strips.JPG|thumb|left|To ensure that the mast acts as a single conductor, the separate structural sections of the mast are connected electrically by copper jumpers or "fusion" (arc) welds across the mating flanges.]]
Most mast radiators are built as [[guyed mast]]s insulated from the ground at the base. Steel [[lattice mast]]s of triangular cross-section are the most common type. Square lattice masts and tubular masts are also sometimes used. To ensure that the tower is a continuous conductor, the tower's structural sections are electrically bonded at the joints by short copper jumpers which are soldered to each side.  

[[Image:Base feed.spliced.jpg|thumb|right|Base feed: [[Radio frequency]] power is fed to the mast by a wire attached to it, which comes from an [[Antenna tuner|antenna tuning unit]] inside the "[[helix building]]" at right.  The brown ceramic insulator at the base keeps the mast isolated from the ground.  On the left there is an earthing switch and a spark gap for lightning protection.]]
At its base, the mast is usually mounted on a thick ceramic insulator, which has the compressive strength to support the tower's weight and the dielectric strength to withstand the high RF voltage applied by the transmitter. The [[Radio frequency|RF]] power to drive the antenna is supplied by an [[antenna tuner]] unit, usually housed in a small building called a [[helix building]] next to the mast, and the cable supplying the current is simply bolted to the tower. The actual [[transmitter]] is usually located in a separate building, which supplies RF power to the helix building via a [[transmission line]].

[[image:Blosenbergturm.jpg|thumb|left|The Blosenbergturm in Beromünster, Switzerland - a radiating tower insulated against ground]]
Free-standing towers are also used as radiating structures. These towers can have a triangular or a square cross section, with each leg supported on an insulator. One of the best-known radiating towers is the [[Blosenbergturm]] in [[Beromünster]], [[Switzerland]]. [[Fiberglass]] masts are sometimes used for small constructions.

===Mast height===
The ideal height of a mast radiator depends on [[radio frequency|transmission frequency]], [[demographics]] for the location, and terrain. For radio systems in the [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] range, the value of the height should be in the range between one sixth and five eighths of the wavelength, with preferred values at the quarter or the half of the radiated wavelength. When this is not possible, masts with a [[loading coil]], 'capacity hat' or similar loading arrangement are used.

The height of the mast determines the radiation properties. For high power transmitters in the MW range, masts with heights around half of the radiated wavelength are preferred because they focus the radiated power better to the ground than structures with heights of quarter wavelengths, which are preferred for economical reasons for low power medium wave transmitters. A focus of radiated power towards the ground is much desired on frequencies below 3 [[megahertz]], because groundwave propagation is very stable. Masts longer than five eighths of the wavelength are normally not used, because they show bad vertical radiation patterns, so masts for mediumwave transmitters do not normally exceed 300 metres.  For [[longwave]] transmitters, however, the construction of masts with heights of half-wave wavelength is generally not economically viable and in most cases impossible. The only [[longwave]] radio mast with a height of the half length of the radiated wavelength was the [[Warszawa Radio Mast]] at [[Konstantynów (Płock County)|Konstantynów]], [[Poland]]. At the time of its collapse in 1991 it was the tallest manmade structure in the world, at 646.38 metres (2,120.67&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, for a wavelength of 1292.76 metres (frequency 232 kHz).  For frequencies below longwave, masts are electrically enlarged by [[loading coil]]s or capacity hats on the top, because masts of even quarter wavelength would be too high to be practical.

===Feed arrangements===
[[File:First mast radiator antenna Akron 1931.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The first mast radiator antenna, a 221 foot (67 m) tower built in 1931 in Akron, Ohio, as a transmitter for the Akron police department.  The inset ''(right)'' shows one of the four legs supported on insulators.]]
[[File:Johnny ball strain insulator.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Guy lines have egg-shaped strain insulators in them, to prevent the high voltage on the mast from reaching the ground]] 

There are three ways of feeding a mast radiator from a transmitter:
*Series excited: the mast is supported on an insulator, and the transmitter is connected to the mast just above it;
*Shunt excited: the mast is grounded and the transmitter feeds it via a wire connected to the mast part way up. (This is a similar approach, on a larger scale, to the 'gamma match' popular among [[amateur radio operator]]s for VHF and UHF [[amateur radio]] antennas.)
*Sectional: the structure is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This [[Collinear antenna array|collinear]] arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (sky wave) radiation. This increases the distance to the [[mush zone]] where the ground wave and sky wave are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an anti-fading aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.

There is usually an antenna matching unit to match the impedance of the transmitter or feeder to the antenna. Depending on the power involved, this may be a small box or a hut or building. It will typically contain an [[L-network]] to transform the modulus of impedance, and a coil or capacitor in series with the mast connection to 'tune out' any reactive component.

===Location of transmission facility===
At some facilities, especially the older and higher-powered installations, the mast radiator may be located at some distance from the transmitter building, in order to reduce the field strength induced by the mast into the building, and to prevent the building from distorting the mast's radiation pattern. Between the transmitter building and the antenna matching unit next to the mast radiator, there is a feeder: either an underground coaxial cable or an overhead wire 'cage' feeder.

At facilities with multiple masts, spacings are typically smaller, in order to fit them into the available space.

At modern transmitters or at low power transmitters situated in very small [[transmitter building]]s the transmitter, matching unit and mast radiator can be very close together and even in the same building. This measure saves on feeders, land area and increases the efficiency of the transmitter if only one mast radiator is in use.

At most facilities the mast radiator is on a separate base close to the antenna matching unit, but it can be sometimes be placed on the roof of the antenna matching unit, for example at the main transmission mast of the [[Mühlacker radio transmitter]] and the main transmission mast of the [[Ismaning radio transmitter]].

For a good groundwave propagation, mast radiators are built on a large flat area with good ground conductivity and if possible without inclination. The construction of a mast radiator on the top of a building or tower whose height is in the same magnitude range as the wavelengths being transmitted gives a bad groundwave propagation. For this reason, mast radiators are (in contrast to FM broadcasting antennas) not typically installed on the top of buildings or towers. Nevertheless in rare cases, mast radiators for low power transmissions are installed on top of buildings. Some lighthouses, such as [[Reykjanesviti]] carry a mast radiator for a longwave radio beacon on the roof. The best-known are [[WGSO#Transmitter|WGSO]] in [[New Orleans]] and [[KSBN (AM)]] on the [[Delaney Building]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]. In Europe, the low-power broadcasting station at [[Campobasso Transmitter|Campobasso]] uses a mast radiator on a castle.

===Fencing===
Mast radiators, as with all other equipment showing over 42 volts on exposed components within 4 metres of the ground, are required to be fenced in.  Usually a chain-link fence is used, but sometimes wooden fences are used in order to prevent signal interference, which could occur due to currents induced by radio signals in metallic fences.
If the mast radiator is mounted on the top of the helix building, which must be over four metres in height; or the mast is grounded, with the feed being located not less than four metres above the ground, a fence is not required.
Nevertheless it is always recommended to fence in any mast radiator in order to prevent unauthorized climbing.

===Ancillary connections===
A mast radiator may need various electrical connections other than the transmitter [[feed line]]. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap balls for lightning protection, power supplies for [[aircraft warning lights|aircraft warning lamps]], and coaxial feeders for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high [[Radio frequency|RF]] voltage on the mast, such as [[Choke (electronics)|chokes]], [[parallel circuit|parallel tuned circuits]] and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.

==Anti-fading antennas==
[[Image:Hamersley radio mast closeup.jpg|thumb|Capacitive "top hat" on mast is occasionally used for [[electrical lengthening]], to allow a shorter mast to be electrically resonant.]]

An anti-fading antenna (informally and often incorrectly termed a "Franklin" antenna) is a long- and medium-wave transmission antenna with a flat vertical radiation pattern. The design goal is to move the [[mush zone]] farther from the transmitter site. An anti-fading antenna will reduce radiation at elevations of more than 50 degrees as much as possible. In principle, such a radiator should be as thin as possible, although thicker radiators improve the bandwidth and contribute to a taller effective height.

These antennas are usually constructed using a metal radio mast, which is fed both at its base and at an appropriate height. The radio mast is usually insulated from ground and is divided electrically by a separation insulator into two parts. For feeding of the upper part, either a cable inside the mast construction or the ladder, which must be mounted on insulators, is used. This design is employed in the [[transmitter Muehlacker|Mühlacker]], [[Rheinsender|Wolfsheim]] and [[transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt|Hamburg]] medium-wave transmitters. Anti-fading antennas with two separation insulators are installed at [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].

Because separation insulators are fragile compared to the construction of the radio mast framework, horizontal forces, such as those generated by wind-caused oscillations, need to be minimized. Radio masts with built-in separation insulators may employ oscillation dampers just above the separation insulator. This approach is used on the radio masts of [[Rheinsender|Wolfsheim]], [[transmitter Hamburg-Billstedt|Hamburg]] and [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].

A simple anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator whose height is between 1/2 wavelength (180 electrical degrees) and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although these can be useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have anti-fading properties.

A more complex anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator which is sectionalized and is one wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a "Franklin" radiator; two in an array at [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]]), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI]] radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost at the expense of somewhat poorer "fringe" reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.

Another form of anti-fading mast antenna is a circular array antenna, in which a number of mast radiators are arranged on a circle and fed in equal phase. With this design, very flat radiation patterns may be produced, although they are very expensive since multiple radio masts are required. [[Taldom transmitter]] and [[Tulagino transmitter]] in Russia are currently the only radio stations in the world using such antennas. At one time, [[longwave transmitter Orlunda]] in Sweden also used an antenna of this type.

==Records==
The tallest mast radiator ever built was the [[Warsaw radio mast]] at Konstantynow, Poland. The antenna was {{convert|648.38|m|ft}} high but collapsed in 1991. Currently the masts of the [[Lualualei VLF transmitter]], at {{convert|458.11|m|ft}}, are the tallest mast radiators insulated against ground. In contrast to the Warsaw Radio Mast, the Lualualei antenna uses extensive [[electrical lengthening]] measures. The tallest mast radiator not using electrical lengthening may be the [[Longwave radio mast Hellissandur|Hellissandur longwave radio mast]] at {{convert|411.48|m|ft}} high.

[[Image:Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute for Biophysics]]
The '''Max Planck Institute of Biophysics''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysik}}) is located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]] in 1937, and moved into a new building in 2003. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

{{coord|50|10|25|N|8|37|49|E|type:landmark|display=title}}

A prerequisite for the understanding of the fundamental processes of life is the knowledge of the structure of the participating macromolecules. Two of the four departments are devoted to the challenging task of determining the structure of [[membrane protein]]s. Under the direction of [[Hartmut Michel]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] of 1988 for the first structure determination of a membrane protein), the Department of Molecular Membrane Biology approaches this problem primarily by [[x-ray crystallography]], whereas the Department of Structural Biology, headed by [[Werner Kühlbrandt]], uses the complementary technique of [[electron microscopy]]. The Department of Biophysical Chemistry, directed by [[Ernst Bamberg]], studies the function of these [[protein]]s in native or reconstituted membranes by electrophysiological and spectroscopic methods. The fourth department "Molecular Neurogenetics" under the direction of [[Peter Mombaerts]] has started its work in 2007. Since 2013, the institute hosts a new department "Theoretical Biophysics", directed by Gerhard Hummer focusing on development and implementation of broad range of computational and theoretical methods to bridge fundamental physics, chemistry and biology of molecular systems.

Since April 2003, the institute's four departments are housed in the same building, resulting in improved scientific interaction between the research groups. Scientific links to fellow researchers at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] have been strengthened further as the institute is now situated next to the University's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories.

Together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Brain Research]] and the [[Goethe University]] of Frankfurt am Main the institute runs the International Max Planck Research School (IMPReS) on the Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, a graduate program offering a Ph.D.

==Note on the Institute's history==
The institute was founded in [[Frankfurt]] as the "[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]]" in 1937. However, it had a predecessor, the "[[Institut für Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin]]" which had been established in 1921 by [[Friedrich Dessauer]], an admirer of Wilhelm Roentgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic "Zentrumspartei", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, [[Boris Rajewsky]] was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term "Biophysics" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name.

Medical Geology.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning defines medical geology as, "The science dealing with the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems in man and animals."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dissanayake|first=Chandrasekara|title=Of Stones and Health: Medical Geology in Sri Lanka|journal=Science|date=5 August 2005|volume=309|pages=883–885|doi=10.1126/science.1115174|pmid=16081722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''In its broadest sense, medical geology studies exposure to or deficiency of trace elements and minerals; inhalation of ambient and anthropogenic mineral dusts and volcanic emissions; transportation, modification and concentration of organic compounds; and exposure to radionuclides, microbes and pathogens.''&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, R.B., Skinner, H. C. W., Plumlee G. S. &amp; Bunnell, J. E. 2001. Medical Geology. Geotimes. http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/nov01/feature_medgeo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many have deemed medical geology as a new field when in actuality it is re-emerging. [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] first recognized the relationship between human diseases and the earth's elements.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bunnell|first=Joseph|title=Medical Geology: Emerging Discipline on the Ecosystem--Human Health Interface|journal=EcoHealth|date=March 2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.1007/s10393-004-0068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only now are people becoming aware of the effects the environment has on our health. This field ultimately depends on a number of different fields coming and working together to solve some of the earth's mysteries. The scientific term for this field is "hydrobiogeochemoepidemiopathoecology" however it is more commonly known as medical geology.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt;  It was established in 1990 by the International Union of Geological Sciences.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Paracelsus]], the father of pharmacology (1493-1541) stated that, "All substances are poisons, there is none which is not a poison. The right dosage differentiates a poison and a remedy."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; This passage sums up the idea of medical geology perfectly. The goal of this field is to find the right balance and intake of elements/ minerals in order to improve and maintain health.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

Examples of research in medical geology include:

* Studies on the impact of contaminant mobility as a result of [[extreme weather]] events such as [[flooding]].
*[[Lead]] and other [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] exposure resulting from [[dust]] and other [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]]
*[[Asbestos]] exposure such as [[amphibole]] asbestos dusts in [[Libby, Montana]]
*[[Fungal]] [[infection]] resulting from airborne dust, such as [[Valley Fever]] or [[coccidioidomycosis]]

Recently a new concept of [[geomedical engineering]] has been introduced in medical geology through a paper titled ''"Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect".''&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rehman A.|date=June 2009|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org/pages/members/publications/newsletters/Newsletter%2014.pdf|title=Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the fundamentals of engineering applications to the medical geology issues.
 
==Environment and human health==
It is widely known that the state of our environment affects us in many ways. [[Minerals]] and [[rocks]] are going to have some impact on [[human]] and [[animal]] populations because that is what the [[earth]] is composed of.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Medical geology brings professionals from both the [[medicine]] field and the [[geology]] field to help us understand this relationship.&lt;ref name=IMGA&gt;{{cite web|title=International Medical Geology Association|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two priorities that have been established within the medical geology field, "(1) the study of [[trace elements]], especially their [[bioavailability]] and (2) a need to establish baseline, or background levels of [[contaminants]]/ [[xenobiotics]]/ potentially harmful but naturally occurring materials in [[water]], [[soil]], [[air]], [[food]], and [[animal]] tissue." &lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt; The elements and minerals in the land effect people and animals immensely especially when there is a close relationship between the two. Those who depend heavily on the land are faced with one of two problems. First, those who live in places such as [[Maputaland]], [[South Africa]] are exposed to heavily impoverished soils which result in a number of diseases caused by [[mineral]] imbalances.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Secondly, those in areas such as [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] are often exposed to an excess of [[Chemical element|element]]s in the land resulting in [[mineral]] [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; We{{who|date=February 2017}} do of course need some naturally occurring [[Chemical element|element]]s however most can be extremely detrimental to our{{who|date=February 2017}} [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selinus|first=Olle|title=Medical Geology: An Opportunity for the Future|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|date=February 2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=114–116|doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[114:mgaoft]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a direct link between [[health]] and the [[earth]] because we{{who|date=February 2017}} ingest and breath in all of these chemicals and for the most part we{{who|date=February 2017}} do it unknowingly.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

===Sources of Chemicals===
There are many ways in which [[humans]] come into contact with the earth's [[Chemical element|element]]s and below are only a few ways in which we become exposed to them.
*[[Volcanoes]] are one of the main sources that bring all the [[toxicity]] from inside the [[earth]] to the outside.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; They bring out [[chemicals]] such as; [[arsenic]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[radon]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;
*[[Rocks]] are also one of the leading sources in exposure to these [[Chemical element|element]]s. "They are essentially the source of all the naturally occurring [[chemical element]]s found on the [[earth]]."&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;

==Diseases==

===Iodine Deficiency===
One of the biggest [[geochemical]] [[diseases]] is [[iodine deficiency]]. Thirty percent of the world is at risk for it and insufficient intake is the most common cause of [[mental retardation]] and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The [[sea]] is a major source of [[iodine]] and those who are further from it are at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Another source of it is in [[soil]], however [[goitrogens]] such as [[humus]] and [[clay]] trap the [[iodine]] making it hard for people to access it.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Some [[cultures]] actually consume the earth's [[minerals]] by eating [[soil]] and [[clay]]; this is known as geophagy.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; It is most common in the tropics, especially among pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The Ottomac people of [[South America]] engage in this practice and none have suffered from any [[health]] problems related with mineral/ Iodine deficiency.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Cardiovascular Disease===
[[Cardiovascular disease]] has often been linked to [[water]] hardness as the main cause.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Water]] hardness means that there is [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] with [[calcium]] playing a role.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Of course some research has completely discredited this evidence, and have found that the more [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] the less chance of death [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Radiation===
Natural [[radiation]] is found everywhere; it is in the [[air]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[rocks]], [[minerals]] and [[food]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The largest amount of [[radiation]] comes from [[radon]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Certain places are called 'high background radiation areas' (HBRAs), such as [[Guarapari]], Southwest of [[France]], [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], parts of [[China]], and Kerala Coast.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; People living in these areas however have not shown any [[health]] deficiencies and in some cases are even healthier and live longer than those not in HBRAs.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Other Issues===
Among the problems presented there are also issues with [[fluoride]] in [[Africa]] and [[India]], [[arsenic]] in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Taiwan]], [[selenium]] in areas of the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]], [[China]] and [[nitrate]] in [[agricultural]] areas.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=B.J.|title=Essentials of Medical Geology: Impacts of the Natural Environment on Public Health|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam, Boston|isbn=0126363412}}&lt;/ref&gt; As medical geology grows it may become more important to the [[medical]] field in the issue of [[diseases]].
In addition to deficiencies of particular minerals, dietary excesses of certain elements occurring in specific geographic regions can also be harmful to human health, as per the examples listed below:
*Hyperkalemia: excess amount of potassium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hypercalcemia: excess amount of calcium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hyperphosphatemia: excess amount of phosphorus&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

==International Medical Geology Association (IMGA)==
"The International Medical Geology Association aims to provide a network and a forum to bring together the combined expertise of [[geologists]] and earth scientists, environmental scientists, [[toxicologists]], [[epidemiologists]], and [[medical]] specialists, in order to characterize the properties of [[geological]] processes and agents, the dispersal of [[geological]] material and their effects on [[human]] population."&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; IMGA was founded in 2006 and manages affairs and funds, plans conferences, elections and publications, and they are also a way of encouraging growth and recognition in the field.&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; Although it was founded in 2006, it was a work in progress for ten years when a working group of medical geology was established by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) in 1996.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; The goal of the working group was to advertise and make people aware of the harmful effects the environment has on our [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

'''Mobile interaction''' is the study of interaction between mobile users and computers. Mobile interaction is an aspect of [[human–computer interaction]] that emerged when computers became small enough to enable mobile usage, around the 1990s.

[[Mobile devices]] are a pervasive part of people's everyday lives. People use [[mobile phones]], [[PDAs]], and [[portable media players]] almost everywhere. These devices are the first truly pervasive interaction devices that are currently used for a huge variety of services and applications.&lt;ref name="Mobile Interaction with the Real World" /&gt; Mobile devices affect the way people interact, share, and communicate with others. They are growing in diversity and complexity, featuring new interaction paradigms, modalities, shapes, and purposes (e.g., [[e-readers]], [[portable media players]], [[handheld game consoles]]). The strong differentiating factors that characterize mobile devices from traditional personal computing (e.g., [[desktop computers]]), are their ubiquitous use, usual small size, and mixed interaction modalities.&lt;ref name="Designing and Evaluating Mobile Interaction: Challenges and Trends" /&gt;

The history of mobile interaction includes different design trends. The main six design trends are portability, [[miniaturization]], [[Internet connectivity|connectivity]], [[Convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]], [[divergence]], and [[application software]] (apps). The main reason behind those trends is to understand the requirements and needs of mobile users which is the main goal for mobile interaction. Mobile interaction is a multidisciplinary area with various academic subjects making contributions to it. The main disciplines involved in mobile interaction are [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[sociology]], [[design]], and [[information systems]]. The processes in mobile interaction design includes three main activities: understanding users, developing prototype designs, and evaluation.

== History ==
The history of mobile interaction can be divided into a number of eras, or waves, each characterized by a particular technological focus, interaction design trends, and by leading to fundamental changes in the design and use of mobile devices. Although not strictly sequential, they provide a good overview of the legacy on which current mobile computing research and design is built.&lt;ref name="Mobile Interactions in Context: A Designerly Way Toward Digital Ecology" /&gt;

# Portability
#: One of the first work in the mobile interaction discipline was the concept of the [[Dynabook]] by [[Alan Kay]] in 1968. However, at that time the necessary hardware to build such system was not available. When the first [[laptop]]s were built in the early 1980s they were seen as transportable [[desktop computers]].
# Miniaturization
#: By the early 1990s, many types of handheld devices were introduced such as labelled [[palmtop]] computers, digital organizers, or [[personal digital assistants]] (PDAs).
# Connectivity
#: By 1973, [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] worked at [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] developed a handheld mobile phone concept, which later on by 1983, led to the introduction of the first commercial mobile phone called the [[DynaTAC 8000X]].[[File:IPhone and iPhone 3G (Yutaka Tsutano).jpg|thumb|[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]]]]
# Convergence
#: During this era, different types of specialized mobile devices started to converge into new types of hybrid devices with primarily different form factors and interaction designs. On 1992, the first device of such technique, the "[[smartphones]]" was introduced. The first smart phone was the [[IBM Simon]] and it was used for making phone calls, calendars, addresses, notes, e-mail, fax and games.
# Divergence
#: During the 2000s, a trend toward a single function many devices started to spread. the basic idea behind divergence is that specialized tools facilitate optimization of functionality over time and enhancement of use. The most famous device of this era was the [[Apple iPod]] on 2001.
# Apps
#: During 2007, [[Apple Inc.]] introduced the first truly "smart" cellular phone; the [[iPhone]]. It was a converged mobile device with different features functionality. The most important thing is that it represents a significant rethinking of the design of mobile interactions and a series of notable interaction design choices. In less than a decade Apple Inc. would sell over one-billion iPhones&lt;ref name="Mobile Interactions in Context: A Designerly Way Toward Digital Ecology" /&gt;

== Goals ==
With the evolution of both [[software]] and hardware on the mobile devices, the users are becoming more demanding of the [[user interface]] that provide both functionality and pleasant [[user experience]]. The goal of mobile interaction researches is to understand the requirements and needs of mobile users. Compared with stationary devices mobile devices have specific, often restricted, input and output requirements. A goal that is often named is to overcome the limitations of mobile devices. However, exploiting the special opportunities of mobile usage can also be seen as a central goal.

== Disciplines involved ==
Mobile interaction is a multidisciplinary area with various academic subjects making contributions. This is a reflection of the complicated nature of an individual's interaction with a computer system. This includes factors such as an understanding of the user and the task the user wants to perform with the system, understanding of the design tools, [[software suite|software packages]] that are needed to achieve this and an understanding of software engineering tools. The following are the main disciplines involved in mobile interaction:&lt;ref name="Understanding Mobile Human-Computer Interaction" /&gt;

===1. Psychology===
Many of the research methods and system evaluation techniques currently used in mobile human-computer interaction research are borrowed from [[psychology]]. As well as attitude measures, performance measures that are used in mobile human-computer interaction research studies come from the area of [[experimental psychology]]. Understanding users and their needs is a key aspect in the design of mobile systems, devices, and applications so that they will be easy and enjoyable to use. Individual user characteristics such as age, or personality physical disabilities such as blindness, all have an effect on users' performance when they are using [[mobile applications]] and systems, and these individual differences can also affect people's attitude towards the mobile service or device that they interact with.

===2. Computer science===
[[Computer science]] (along with [[software engineering]]) is responsible for providing software tools to develop the interfaces that users need to interact with system. These include the [[software development tools]].

===3. Sociology===
[[Sociologist]]s working in this area are responsible for looking at [[socio-technical]] aspects of human-computer interaction. They bring methods and techniques from the [[social sciences]] (e.g., observational studies, ethnography) that can be used in the design and evaluation of mobile devices and applications.

===4. Design===
People working in this area are concerned with looking at the [[design]] layout of the interface (e.g., colors, positioning of text or graphics on a screen of a PDA). This is a crucial area of mobile human-computer interaction research due to the limited screen space available for most mobile devices. Therefore, it is crucial that services and applications reflect this limitation by reducing information complexity to fit the parameters of the mobile device, without losing any substantial content.

===5. Information systems===
People who work in [[information systems]] are interested in investigating how people interact with information and technologies in an organisational, managerial, and business context. In an organisational context, information system professionals and researchers are interested in looking at ways in which mobile technologies and [[mobile applications]] can be used to make an organisation more effective in conducting its business on a day-to-day business.

== Mobile interaction design ==
Mobile interaction design is part of the interaction design which heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires of the majority of people who will use the product.&lt;ref name="About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design" /&gt; The processes in mobile interaction design are in the following main types of activity:&lt;ref name="Mobile Interaction Design" /&gt;
# '''Understanding users''' – having a sense of people's capabilities and limitations; gaining a rich picture of what makes up the detail of their lives, the things they do and use.
# '''Developing prototype designs''' – representing a proposed interaction design in such a way that it can be demonstrated, altered, and discussed.
# '''Evaluation''' – each prototype is a stepping stone to the next, better, refined design. Evaluation techniques identify the strengths and weaknesses of a design but can also lead the team to propose a completely different approach, discarding the current line of design thinking for a radical approach.

The '''Nereus Program''' is a global interdisciplinary initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the [[University of British Columbia]] that was created to further our knowledge of how best to attain sustainability for our world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://oceans.ubc.ca/research/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nippon Foundation and UBC, the program partners with [[University of Cambridge]], [[Duke University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Stockholm University]], United Nations Environment Program-[[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and [[Utrecht University]]. The program is built around three core objectives: to conduct collaborative ocean research across the natural and social sciences, to develop an interdisciplinary network of experts that can engage in discussion of complex and multifaceted questions of ocean sustainability, and to transfer these ideas to practical solutions in global policy forums.

==Program leadership==

==Budget==
15 million USD (1.5 million annually for 9 years from 2011 to 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Nereus Program is solely funded by the Nippon Foundation, the largest non-governmental foundation in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/what/spotlight/ocean_outlook/ |title=Considering the Future of the World’s Oceans |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement and policy applications==
The Nereus Program is engaged with policy processes both at international and regional levels. The program has organized side events and workshops together with international organization representatives and national governmental officers.

2017: Side event at the UN Oceans Conference titled “The Role of the Oceans in Sustainability: Benefits of Achieving SDG 14 for all [[Sustainable Development Goals]]", where discussions led by Nereus affiliates were focused on how research indicates that achieving SDG 14 ocean targets contributes to the achievement of other SDG targets in the context of our changing ocean due to climate change and social equity. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/event/un-oceans-conference-nf-nereus-program-side-event/&lt;/ref&gt;

2016: Side event at the United Nations Fish Stock Agreement Review Conference titled “Science, Policy and Civil Society: The Role of NGOs in Global Fisheries Management", where ongoing Nereus research on the potential role of civil society within regional fisheries management organizations was presented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/managing-straddling-and-highly-migratory-fish-stocks-nereus-holds-side-event-at-the-un-fish-stocks-agreement-review-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

2015: Press conference on the Nereus Program report in Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/news/articles/2015/13.html |title=Nippon Foundation Nereus Program Reveals Critical State of World's Oceans in 2050 |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (covered by 20 international media outlets, including CBS, and five major Japanese newspapers).

2013: Side event at the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea on seafood security and climate change (attended by nine countries representatives including Japan, US and Palau)

==Fellowships==
The Nereus Program provides fellowships to young scholars who conduct their research at participating academic institutes. Since 2011, there have been 30 Nereus Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in various issues on the future of oceans and fisheries. Currently, 11 postdoc and 7 Ph.D. students in the natural and social sciences are participating in the Nereus Program as Nereus Fellows.

Program Alumni have gone on to marine research positions in various institutes, including at the USA [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/about_us/staff/?lname=KEARNEY&amp;fname=Kelly&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.biol.sc.edu/~ryk/&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Atomic Energy Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc_Metian&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ETH Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfroelicher.com/about-me-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

In May 2017, the Nereus Program released a research report, 'Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/sdg-report/ |title=Nereus Report: Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2017-05-31 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing attention to the co-benefits of achieving the ocean goal SDG 14 on other sustainable development goals. Within the report, Nereus affiliate members have highlighted the idea that climate issues and social equity issues are inter-related; thus, this report has deduced that improving the health of our oceans through SDG 14 targets will contribute to the improvement of other areas of society, including, but not limited to, gender equality, sustained economic development, education quality, terrestrial conservation, reduced poverty, and food security. 

In June 2015, the Program released a research report entitled 'Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/nereus-report-predicting-future-oceans-climate-change-oceans-fisheries/ |title=Nereus Report: Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing the main contributions of the numerous projects undertaken by the members of the Nereus Program and its associated colleagues in cross-disciplinary analyses of the global ocean systems. Specifically, this year’s report discussed global changes that are impacting the marine ecosystems’ seafood production capacity, emerging trends in ocean governance, and socioeconomic changes that are affecting our relationship with the sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquablog.ca/2015/07/nereus-program-releases-report-on-current-and-future-ocean-health/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The program has produced over 150 peer-reviewed papers in various journals, including ''Science''&lt;ref&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6243/aac4722&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nature Climate Change''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n3/full/nclimate1691.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Synaptic tagging during memory allocation. Nature Rev. Neurosci 15, 157-169 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although multiple neurons can receive a stimulus, only a subset of the neurons will induce the necessary plasticity for memory encoding. The selection of this subset of neurons is termed [[Neuronal memory allocation#neuronal allocation|neuronal allocation]]. Similarly, multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on to encode the memory, and this process is referred to as [[Neuronal memory allocation#synaptic allocation|synaptic allocation.]]. Memory allocation was first discovered in the lateral amygdala by Sheena Josselyn and colleagues in [[Alcino J Silva]]'s laboratory.&lt;ref name="Han2007"/&gt;

At the neuronal level, cells with higher levels of excitability (for example lower slow afterhyperpolarization&lt;ref name="Zhou2009"&gt;Zhou, Y., Won, J., Karlsson, M. G., Zhou, M., Rogerson, T., Balaji, J., ... &amp; Silva, A. J. (2009). CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala. Nature neuroscience, 12(11), 1438-1443.&lt;/ref&gt;) are more likely to be recruited into a memory trace, and substantial evidence exists implicating the cellular transcription factor [[CREB]] (cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein) in this process.&lt;ref name="Zhou2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yiu"&gt;Yiu, A. P. et al. Neurons Are Recruited to a Memory Trace Based on Relative Neuronal Excitability Immediately before Training.

V., &amp; Collingridge, G. L. (1993). A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Nature, 361(6407), 31-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed mechanisms that might contribute to allocation at the synaptic level include [[synaptic tagging]], capture, and synaptic clustering.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt;

==Neuronal allocation==
'''Neuronal allocation''' is a phenomenon that accounts for how specific neurons in a network, and not others that receive similar input, are committed to storing a specific memory.&lt;ref name ="Rogerson" /&gt;

===The role of CREB in neuronal allocation===
[[File:CREB cAMP neuron pathway png.png|thumb|Multiple intracellular signaling pathways activate [[CREB]], promoting [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] of target proteins that support long-term neuronal plasticity and allocation.]]
The transcription factor [[CREB|cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)]] is a well-studied mechanism of neuronal memory allocation. Most studies to date use the [[amygdala]] as a model circuit, and [[Amygdala#Emotional learning|fear-related memory traces]] in the amygdala are mediated by [[CREB]] expression in the individual neurons allocated to those memories.&lt;ref name="Han2007"&gt;Han, J. H., Kushner, S. A., Yiu, A. P., Cole, C. J., Matynia, A., Brown, R. A., ... &amp; Josselyn, S. A. (2007). Neuronal competition and selection during memory formation. science, 316(5823), 457-460.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhou2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Han2009"&gt;Han, J. H., Kushner, S. A., Yiu, A. P., Hsiang, H. L. L., Buch, T., Waisman, A., ... &amp; Josselyn, S. A. (2009). Selective erasure of a fear memory. Science, 323(5920), 1492-1496.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CREB]] modulates cellular processes that lead to neuronal allocation, particularly with regards to [[dendritic spine]] density and morphology.&lt;ref name="Sargin2013"&gt;Sargin, D., Mercaldo, V., Yiu, A. P., Higgs, G., Han, J. H., Frankland, P. W., &amp; Josselyn, S. A. (2013). CREB regulates spine density of lateral amygdala neurons: implications for memory allocation. Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the memory mechanisms studied to date are conserved across different brain regions, and it is likely that the mechanisms of fear-based memory allocation found in the amygdala will also be similarly present for other types of memories throughout different brain regions.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; Indeed, Sano and colleagues in the Silva lab showed that CREB also regulates neuronal memory allocation in the amygdala.&lt;ref name="Sano"&gt;Sano, Y, Shobe, JL, Zhou, M,  Huang, S, Cai, DJ, Roth, BL, Kamata, M, and Silva, AJ. CREB regulates memory allocation in the insular cortex. Curr Biol. 2014 Nov 13;24(23):2833-283 (2014) {{PMID|25454591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CREB]] may be activated by multiple pathways. For example, the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)]] and [[Protein Kinase A|protein kinase A (PKA)]] pathways appear to participate in neuronal allocation.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; When activated by the second messengers such as [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and calcium ions, enzymes such as [[Protein Kinase A|PKA]] and [[MAP kinase]] can translocate to the nucleus and [[phosphorylate]] [[CREB]] to initiate [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of target genes.&lt;ref name="Adams2002"&gt;Adams, J. P., &amp; Sweatt, J. D. (2002). Molecular psychology: roles for the ERK MAP kinase cascade in memory.

Current Opinion in Cell Biology, 8(2), 205-215.&lt;/ref&gt; PKA inhibitors can block the development of long-lasting [[long-term potentiation|LTP]], and this is accompanied by a reduction in the transcription of genes modulated by the CREB protein.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2003"&gt;Nguyen, P. V., &amp; Woo, N. H. (2003). Regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Progress in Neurobiology,71(6), 401-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaplasticity in neuronal allocation===
{{Main|Metaplasticity}}
[[Metaplasticity]] is a term describing the likelihood that a given stimulus will induce neuronal plasticity, based on the previous activity experienced by that neuron. Several studies provide evidence that neurons receiving “priming activity” (such as neurotransmitters, paracrine signals, or hormones) minutes to days prior will show a lower threshold for induction of [[long term potentiation| long term potentiation (LTP)]].&lt;ref name="Goussakov2000"&gt;Goussakov, I. V., Fink, K., Elger, C. E., &amp; Beck, H. (2000). Metaplasticity of mossy fiber synaptic transmission involves altered release probability. The Journal of Neuroscience, 20(9), 3434-3441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham"&gt;Abraham, W. C., &amp; Tate, W. P. (1997). Metaplasticity: a new vista across the field of synaptic plasticity. Progress in Neurobiology, 52(4), 303-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koon"&gt;Koon, Alex C., et al. "Autoregulatory and paracrine control of synaptic and behavioral plasticity by octopaminergic signaling." Nature neuroscience 14.2 (2011): 190-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies find that activation of NMDARs can also raise the stimulation threshold for induction of [[long term potentiation|LTP]].&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; Thus, similar inputs on groups of neurons may induce LTP in some but not others based on prior activity of those neurons.&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;Rudy, J. (2014). Specific mechanisms: Targeting plasticity products. In The neurobiology of Learning and Memory (Second ed., pp. 113-116). Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Signaling mechanisms implicated in these metaplastic effects include [[autophosphorylation]] of [[CaMKII|αCaMKII]],&lt;ref name="Zhang2005"&gt;Zhang, L., Kirschstein, T., Sommersberg, B., Merkens, M., Manahan-Vaughan, D., Elgersma, Y., &amp; Beck, H. (2005). Hippocampal synaptic metaplasticity requires inhibitory autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. The Journal of Neuroscience, 25(33), 7697-7707.&lt;/ref&gt; changes in [[NMDA receptor]] subunit composition,&lt;ref name="Cho2009"&gt;Cho, K. K., Khibnik, L., Philpot, B. D., &amp; Bear, M. F. (2009). The ratio of NR2A/B NMDA receptor subunits determines the qualities of ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(13), 5377-5382.&lt;/ref&gt; and activation of [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s.&lt;ref name="Zhang2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2010"&gt;Lee, M. C., Yasuda, R., &amp; Ehlers, M. D. (2010). Metaplasticity at single glutamatergic synapses. Neuron, 66(6), 859-870.&lt;/ref&gt; These metaplastic effects regulate memory destabilization and [[memory consolidation|reconsolidation]].&lt;ref name="Finnie"&gt;Finnie, Peter SB, and Karim Nader. "The role of metaplasticity mechanisms in regulating memory destabilization and reconsolidation." Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews 36.7 (2012): 1667-1707.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synaptic allocation==
'''Synaptic allocation''' pertains to mechanisms that influence how [[synapse]]s come to store a given memory.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; Intrinsic to the idea of synaptic allocation is the concept that multiple synapses can be activated by a given set of inputs, but specific mechanisms determine which synapses actually go on the encode the memory. Allocation of memories to specific synapses are key to determining where [[memories]] are stored.

===Synaptic tagging and capture===
[[File:Plasticity products.jpg|thumb|A strong stimulus may produce both a tag on the synapse being stimulated and a genomic signaling cascade leading to the formation of plasticity products. The tag will then serve to capture these plasticity products. A weak signal on a nearby synapse may produce a tag but not a genomic signal. This tag can also serve to, capture [[plasticity product]]s and strengthen the weakly-stimulated synapse.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;]]
{{Main|Synaptic tagging}}
Synaptic activity can generate a synaptic tag, which is a marker that allows the stimulated spine to subsequently capture newly transcribed [[plasticity product|plasticity molecules]] such as [[Arc (protein)|Arc]]. Synaptic activity can also engage the [[Translation (biology)|translation]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] machinery. Weak stimulation can create synaptic tags but will not engage the translation and transcription machinery, whereas strong stimulation will create synaptic tags and also engage the translation and transcription machinery. Newly generated plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) can be captured by any tagged synapses, but untagged synapses are not eligible to receive new PPs. After a certain time period, synapses will lose their tag and return to their initial state. Furthermore, the supply of new PRPs will deplete. The tags and new PRPs must overlap in time to capture the PRPs.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frey"&gt;Frey, U. &amp; Morris, R. G. Synaptic tagging: implications for late maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation. Trends Neurosci. 21, 181–188 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Govindarajan"&gt;Govindarajan, A. et al. The dendritic branch is the preferred integrative unit for protein synthesis-dependent LTP. Neuron 69, 132–146 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[synaptic tagging|synaptic tag]] is inversely related to time between inducing stimuli, and is said to be temporarily asymmetrical. Furthermore, the tagging is also inversely related to the distance between spines, an important spatial properties of tagging. Conversely confirming the temporal and spatial properties of the synaptic tagging, subsequent imaging studies revealed that there are not only temporal constraints but also structural constraints that limit synaptic tagging and capture mechanisms. Overall, these studies demonstrate the complexity of synaptic tagging and capture, and give further insight into how exactly this mechanism occurs.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt;

===Spine clustering===
Synaptic clustering refers to the addition of new spines to a dendritic area where other spines have been added by previous learning.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; Spine clustering may result in the amplification of synaptic inputs via diffusible molecular crosstalk that occurs near activated spines.1 For example, studies have shown that signaling molecules synthesized at one spine, (e.g. activated RAS and/or RHOA), may diffuse out and influence spine growth at nearby sites.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, C. D. et al. The spread of Ras activity triggered by activation of a single dendritic spine. Science 321, 136–140 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho GTPase]] [[CDC42]] may also contribute to spine clustering by driving long-term spine volume increases. Recent studies also suggest that this process may be regulated by [[NMDA receptor]] activation and nitric oxide stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murakoshi"&gt;Murakoshi, H., Wang, H. &amp; Yasuda, R. Local, persistent activation of Rho GTPases during plasticity of single dendritic spines. Nature 472, 100–104 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spine clustering in the [[motor cortex]] reflects a morphological mechanism for synaptic storage of specific motor memories. These clustered spines are more stable than non-clustered new spines. This type of addition of spines occurs in a specific pattern, meaning that spines added after one task will not cluster with spines after an alternative task.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Fu, M. et al. Repetitive motor learning induces coordinated formation of clustered [[dendritic spines]] in vivo. Nature 483, 92–95 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of spine clustering is also a possibility as shown in some [[fear conditioning]] experiments, leading to the net loss of spines in the frontal association cortex, a region strongly associated in fear conditioning, which strongly correlates with memory on [[Recall (memory)|recall]]. Once spines were added after fear extinction had a similar orientation to the spines lost during the original fear conditioning.&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;Lai, C. S. et al. Opposite effects of fear conditioning and extinction on dendritic spine remodelling. Nature 483, 87–91 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms that link memories across time ==
Denise Cai in the Silva laboratory found that memory allocation mechanisms are used to connect or link memories across time.&lt;ref&gt;Cai DJ, Aharoni D, Shuman T, Shobe J, Biane J, Song W, Wei B, Veshkini M, La-Vu M, Lou J, Flores S, Kim I, Sano Y, Zhou M, Baumgaertel K, Lavi A, Kamata M, Tuszynski M, Mayford M, Golshani P, Silva AJ. A shared neural ensemble links distinct contextual memories encoded close in time. Nature 2016 May 23;534(7605):115-8&lt;/ref&gt; In their studies they demonstrated that  one contextual memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons, such that a subsequent contextual memory, occurring within 5 hours, can be allocated to some of the same CA1 neurons that stored the first contextual memory. As a consequence of this overlap between the CA1 memory engrams for the two contextual  memories, recall of one contextual memory activates the retrieval of the second memory. These studies also showed that contextual memory linking mechanisms are disrupted in the aging brain, and that increasing excitability in a subset of CA1 neurons reverses these memory linking deficits. It is very likely that impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging brains could account for abnormalities in memory linking and possibly related source memory problems ([[source amnesia]]) associated with aging.

==Current and future research==

===Integrating synaptic and neuronal allocation===
Experiments have yet to investigate the interaction of allocative mechanisms between the neuronal and synaptic levels. The two classes of processes are very likely to be interconnected considering the relationship between neurons and synapses in a neuronal network. For example, the synaptic tagging and capture involved in synaptic allocation requires the allocation of the neurons to which the synapses belong to. Moreover, increases in neuronal excitability in a given neuronal ensemble may affect some dendrites more than others, thus biasing memory storage to synapses in dendrites with higher excitability.&lt;ref name="Larkum"&gt;Larkum, M. E. &amp; Nevian, T. Synaptic clustering by dendritic signalling mechanisms. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 18, 321–331 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Losonczy"&gt;Losonczy, A., Makara, J. K. &amp; Magee, J. C. Compartmentalized dendritic plasticity and input feature storage in neurons. Nature 452, 436–441 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, on the recruited neurons displaying increased excitability, specific synapses need to be selected for in order to store the information in the form of synaptic plasticity.

One aspect of integration involves [[metaplasticity]] and how acquisition and storage of one memory changes the [[biological neural network|neural circuit]] to affect the storage and properties of a subsequent memory. Cellular excitability has been proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for heterosynaptic metaplasticity, the modulation of subsequent plasticity at different synapses.&lt;ref name="Frick"&gt;Frick, A. &amp; Johnston, D. Plasticity of dendritic excitability. J. Neurobiol. 64, 100–115 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  CREB functions through elevating cell excitability as described above, thus it is also possibly involved in hetrerosynaptic metaplasticity. [[Synaptic tagging]] and capture, as introduced in sections above, can result in a weak memory (capable of triggering only E-LTP), which would otherwise be forgotten, but it can be strengthened and stabilized by a strong memory (capable of triggering L-LTP), which is a form of heterosynaptic plasticity.

===Future research===
Despite extensive research into the individual mechanisms of memory allocation, there are few studies investigating the integration of these mechanisms. It has been proposed that understanding the implications of the molecular, cellular and systemic mechanisms of these processes may elucidate how they are coordinated and integrated during memory formation.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; For example, identifying the [[plasticity product|plasticity-related proteins]] (PRPs) involved in synaptic tagging and capture as well as the upstream and downstream molecules of CREB can help reveal potential interactions. Investigating the functional significance of these mechanisms will require tools that can directly manipulate and image the processes involved in the proposed mechanisms in vivo.&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt; For instance, it is possible that the behavioral interactions ascribed to synaptic tagging and capture are caused by protein synthesis-dependent increases in [[neuromodulation|neuromodulators]] such as [[dopamine]] rather than by synaptic tagging mechanisms. Examining the behavioral effects under direct manipulation can help rule out these other possible causes.

The '''New Bach Edition''' (NBE), in [[German language|German]] '''Neue Bach-Ausgabe''' (NBA), is the second complete edition of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], published by [[Bärenreiter]]. The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: ''historisch-kritische Ausgabe'') of Bach's complete works by the [[Johann Sebastian Bach Institute]] (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the [[Bach Archive]] (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,

When Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the [[Bach Gesellschaft]] ([[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]], BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores.  The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]]  via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NBE is an [[urtext edition]] rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. 

==History==

In 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]] led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as [[Friedrich Blume]], Max Schneider, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Smend|de}} and [[Heinrich Besseler]], and sponsors such as [[Bernhard Sprengel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Benecke|de}} made the project possible, supported by the editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Vötterle|de}}.

The [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors [[Werner Neumann]] and [[Alfred Dürr]] made the new edition their life's project.  The publishers were [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]], chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.

Initially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article939434/Praeludium_zur_Deutschen_Einheit.html |title=Präludium zur Deutschen Einheit |author=Volker Tarnow |date=12 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.uc.edu/libraries/ccm/incs/neuebachausgabe.html |title=Neue Bach-Ausgabe |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a  Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):&lt;ref name="NBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |title=Johann Sebastian Bach / 1685-1750 / New Edition of the Complete Works |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[Bärenreiter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103204656/http://baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Score volume contains a preface and a selection of [[facsimile]]s of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;

== Relevance ==

The New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. 

In preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

The second revised edition of the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Alfred Dürr]], Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger.

A '''paleontographer''' or '''palaeontographer''' is anyone who works in the field of '''[[palaeontography]]''', a subset of paleontology . The term has been in use in this sense for more than a hundred and fifty years, for example by the [[Palaeontographical Society]].

The term has more recently been adopted for one who uses [[medical imaging]] technology to scan [[fossil]]s; mainly using [[Computed tomography|CT scanning]] or any non-invasive scanning [[technology]]. Sean Mclain Brown, a journalist with the Sierra Madre Mountain News, first coined the term in the Sierra Madre Mountain News (Volume Two, Issue 30) in February 1999.

The use of medical CT scanning technology allows scientists to use a non-invasive method to examine fossils or rock specimens without physically removing material, called preparation.

Inventor/Software engineer Lee Schiel of Early Response Imaging and Doctors Michael Smith and John Nesson of Arcadia Methodist Hospital were the first pioneers of this field in the late 1990s.

'''Plasmolysis''' is the process in which cells lose water in a [[hypertonic]] solution. The reverse process, [[cytolysis]], can occur if the cell is in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] solution resulting in a lower external [[osmotic pressure]] and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, it is possible to determine the [[tonicity]] of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]].

== Turgidity ==
{{main|Turgor pressure}}
A plant cell in hypotonic solution will absorb water by [[endosmosis]], so that the increased volume of water in the cell will increase pressure, making the [[protoplasm]] push against the [[cell wall]], a condition known as [[turgor]]. Turgor makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non-woody plant tissue. Plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point, known as full turgor, which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions. This is also the reason that plants stand upright. Without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight.  Turgor pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect, and plants without turgor pressure (known as flaccid) wilt. A cell will begin to decline in turgor pressure only when there is no air spaces surrounding it and eventually leads to a greater osmotic pressure than that of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plants in Action|last=Munns|first=Rana|publisher=Australian Society of Plant Scientists|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuoles play a role in turgor pressure when water leaves the cell due to [[hyperosmotic]] solutions containing solutes such as [[mannitol]], [[sorbitol]], and [[sucrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|date=10 September 2014|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/pdf|journal=Plants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmolysis ==
[[Image:Turgor pressure on plant cells diagram.svg|thumb|300px|right|Plant cell under different environments]] If a plant cell is placed in a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] solution, the plant cell loses water and hence [[turgor]] pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple.  A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to [[cytorrhysis]] – the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with [[hypertonic]] solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, [[exosmosis]] takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a [[hypotonic]] solution. [[Stoma|Stomata]] help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. [[Wax]] also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called [[crenation]]. 
The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to exosmosis. The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] ([[plasma membrane]]) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.

Plasmolysis only occurs in extreme conditions and rarely happens in nature. It is induced in the laboratory by immersing cells in strong [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause [[exosmosis]], often using ''[[Elodea]]'' plants or [[onion epidermal cell]]s, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible.  [[Methylene blue]] can be used to stain plant cells.

Plasmolysis is mainly known as shrinking of cell membrane in hypertonic solution and great pressure.

Plasmolysis can be of two types, either concave plasmolysis or convex plasmolysis. Convex plasmolysis is always irreversible while concave plasmolysis is usually reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|date=2014-11-26|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583|journal=Plants|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.3390/plants3040583|pmc=4844282|pmid=27135521}}&lt;/ref&gt; During concave plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast partially shrinks from the cell wall due to half-spherical, inwarding curving pockets forming between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. During convex plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast shrinks completely from the cell wall, with the plasma membrane's ends in a symmetrically, spherically curved pattern.&lt;ref name="[1]"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Ingeborg|last2=Sassmann|first2=Stefan|last3=Schmidt|first3=Brigitte|last4=Komis|first4=George|title=Plasmolysis: Loss of Turgor and Beyond|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/3/4/583/htm|website=Plants|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

===Computer science===
Within [[computer science]], [[Information science|informatics]] uses the term 'provenance'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yu Shyang|last2=Ko|first2=Ryan K.L.|last3=Holmes|first3=Geoff|date=November 2013|title=Security and Data Accountability in Distributed Systems: A Provenance Survey|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6832103/|journal=2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications &amp; 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.221|isbn=9780769550886}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean the [[Data lineage|lineage of data]], as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipaw.info/&lt;/ref&gt; and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP).&lt;ref&gt;http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/tapp2015/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semantic web]] standards bodies, including the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the [[Proof Markup Language]] and the Open Provenance Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://openprovenance.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al.

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

'''Ralava Beboarimisa''' (born 1978) is a [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] politician who is Minister of transport and meteorology of Madagascar and is best known for being Ministry of Environment, Ecology, Sea and Forest from January 2015 to April 2016.

One of the biggest problems Beboarimisa faced during his tenure as minister of the environment was the rapid deforestation and threat to the flora and fauna of the island that Madagascar is undergoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralava Beboarimisa, le nouveau ministre de l'environnement a du pain sur la planche (Ralava Beboarimisa, the new Minister of the Environment has a lot to do)|url=https://www.madonline.com/ralava-beboarimisa-le-nouveau-ministre-de-lenvironnement-a-du-pain-sur-la-planche/|publisher=MadOnline|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first law he helped pass was the so-called "Beboarimisa law" which toughened the sanctions of cutting down redwoods in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ralava Beboarimisa : La nouvelle loi mettra fin aux trafics illicites et conduira au développement (Ralava Beboarimisa, the new Minister of the Environment has a lot to do)|url=http://www.midi-madagasikara.mg/economie/2016/01/25/ralava-beboarimisa-la-nouvelle-loi-mettra-fin-aux-trafics-illicites-et-conduira-au-developpement/|publisher=Midi-Madagasikara|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=28 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beboarimisa's hard tactics at combating deforestation made him a popular figure in the country, and for a brief period of time it was rumored that he might succeed [[Jean Ravelonarivo]] as the next prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primature Ralava Beboarimisa poussé dans la course (Primature Ralava Beboarimisa pushed into the race)|url=http://www.laverite.mg/politique/item/142-primature-ralava-beboarimisa-poussé-dans-la-course.html|publisher=La Vérité|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=27 March 2018|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Beboarimisa ended up losing his job in April 2016 after more than 1,000 tons of redwood were discovered in possession of a Hong Kong businessman in Singapore, leading to questions how such a large amount could have been smuggled out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar - Singapore rosewood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">'''Sociotherapy''' is a [[social science]] and form of [[social work]], and [[sociology]]  that involves the study of groups of people, its constituent individuals and their behavior, using learned information in case and care management towards holistic life enrichment or improvement of social and life conditions.  

The professional practitioner of the field, who may be called a '''sociotherapist''' or '''life enrichment therapist''', sometimes called a '''clinical sociologist''', is usually concurrently a member of another relevant profession: [[medical doctor]], [[psychiatrist]], [[psychologist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[sociologist]], [[criminologist]], activity and recreational professionals, among others.  Clinical sociotherapy usually targets groups of [[children]], [[youth]]s or [[elderly]], employed in various settings such as treatment facilities or lifecare communities like [[nursing home]]s and are directly involved in case management and [[nursing care plan|care planning]].

==Professional definition==
Still in its infancy as a social science and profession, sociotherapy is ill-defined and thus takes many forms, according to the respective definitions created by the individual [[therapist]]s, firms and institutions that employ sociotherapists and life enrichment therapists.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12861370&amp;dopt=Abstract|title=[Sociotherapy in German social law. Indication, contents, and aspects of public health]|first=R.-M.|last=Frieboes|date=1 July 2003|publisher=|journal=Nervenarzt|volume=74|issue=7|pages=596–600|via=PubMed|doi=10.1007/s00115-002-1459-0|pmid=12861370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy defines sociotherapy as "the methodical management of the living environment of a group of clients, directed towards reaching the treatment targets of this group—and conceived as a means of achieving the treatment targets of the individual client—within a functional unit, usually in a clinical treatment setting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm#def Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, definition of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222092444/http://centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc1.htm |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is most accepted especially in lifecare communities such as nursing homes.

The Sociotherapy Association in the United States describes a sociotherapy that emphasizes the support of awareness, relationship, and the integration of life and the environment. Its main focus is the process of interpersonal relationships as a method of facilitating healthier living, rather than diagnosing intrapsychic psychopathology, and attempting to change it through coercion and analysis (psychology and psychotherapy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com Sociotherapy Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for the Furtherance of Sociotherapy says: "Sociotherapy operates through a holistic vision of mankind. That is to say that the human being is seen as a somatic, psychic, social and spiritual unity, which is unique because of his own history of growth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm#gen Sociotherapy in the clinic of Foundation Centrum '45, general methods of approach of Sociotherapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214003/http://www.centrum45.nl/therap/uksoc2.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition of sociotherapy as a social science and profession is also based on regional dicta.  For example, the public health insurance system of [[Germany]] offered a uniquely German definition in order to subsidize treatment by sociotherapeutic professionals.  It said that sociotherapy "designates non-medical, social, and work-related components of the care process".&lt;ref name=multiple/&gt; 

Sociotherapy has been used in the treatment and education of adolescents at Kanner Academy and Community Schools in Sarasota Florida US. In These settings the working definition of sociotherapy is the practice of promoting healthy growth and living by facilitating therapeutic communities, personal relationships and positive peer culture. It is better known as the "relationship therapy".&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Lee Ph.D, Kanner, C. (2004) The Value of Connection: A Relational Approach to Ethics. (Chapter 5 The Relational Ethic in the Treatment of Adolescents)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand L. Kannenberg wrote, "Sociotherapy for Sociopaths: Resocial Group". Designed by the author to help prevent relapse and rearrest of parolees and probationers at a community mental health center in 1986, this text outlines an evidence-based, twenty-four session group program created for adult clients with coexisting Substance Use Disorders and the persistent problems of aggressiveness, breaking rules and laws, carelessness, dishonesty, impulsivity, indifference, irresponsibility and irritability. The book examines the importance of sociotherapy or sociological counseling in the corrections and substance abuse fields. 
"Kannenberg's fresh approach to treating psychoactive chemical abusing sociopaths should be in every counselor's arsenal when treating a client of this nature."&lt;ref&gt;Misti Storie, Education and Training Coordinator, Counselor Resources, "Reader's Corner," (NAADAC News, August 2005).

===Practice===

The foundation of any sociotherapeutic relationship include the practice of dialogical relationship, the phenomenological method, field-theoretical strategies, experimental freedom, countertransference (CT) management.

Support Companionship is a time tested method for helping people, who for one reason or another, are struggling in their lives. Support Companions provide wrap-around support to adults, adolescents, families, the elderly, children, and service providers, when the support is needed! The foundation of support companion services is relationship, and the methodology of contact is sociotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supportcompanions.com|title=Support Companions - SUPPORTING HEALTHY LIVING ONE RELATIONSHIP AT A TIME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociotherapists are constantly involved in creating and refining theories in group and socialization dynamics.  For example, a sociotherapist in a nursing home may experiment on the various methods one might employ to lure an introverted resident to activities and thus reduce the resident's risk of social isolation, which may be linked to the continued progression of that resident's [[dementia]].  In this example, the sociotherapist would also use activities like games and exercises to monitor an individual's [[mental health]] and use interaction with other residents as a tool to improve that mental health.

===Phenomenological method===

The goal of a phenomenological exploration is awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Yontef, G. (1993) Awareness, Dialogue, and Process, essays on Gestalt therapy. Highland, NY: The Gestalt Journal Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sociotherapy awareness and integration are central to healthy living. Much of the practice is centered around ways to support and improve a sense of awareness in our fields of experience. This is accomplished with relationship, experimentation and phenomenological exploration.

The phenomenological method comprises three steps: (1) the rule of epoché, (2) the rule of description, and (3) the rule of horizontalization.&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli, E. (2005) The interpreted world, an introduction to phenomenological psychology, 2nd edition. London, UK: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the rule of epoché we sets aside our personal initial biases and prejudices in order to suspend expectations and assumptions. Applying the rule of description, one occupies oneself with describing instead of explaining. Applying the rule of horizontalization one treats each item of description as having equal value or significance.

When it comes to a socio-therapeutic relationship the rule of epoché sets aside any initial theories with regard to what is presented in the meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of any clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. 

As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's "lived experience".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersubjectivity===

Intersubjectivity emphasizes that shared understanding and consensus is essential in the shaping of our ideas, experiencing, and relations. Language, quintessentially, is viewed as communal rather than private. Therefore, it is problematic to view the individual as partaking in a private world, one which has a meaning defined apart from any other subjects. But in our shared divergence from a commonly understood experience, these private worlds naturally emerge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociotherapyassociation.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bay of Fundy.jpg|400px|thumb|High and low tide in the [[Bay of Fundy]]]]

The '''theory of tides''' is the application of [[continuum mechanics]] to interpret and predict the [[tide|tidal]] deformations of planetary and satellite bodies and their atmospheres and [[ocean]]s (especially Earth's Ocean) under the gravitational loading of another astronomical body or bodies (especially the [[Moon]]).

== Kepler ==

In 1609 [[Johannes Kepler]] correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon causes the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova …'' (1609), p. 5 of the Introductio in hoc opus&lt;/ref&gt; basing his argument upon ancient observations and correlations. The influence of the Moon on tides was mentioned in Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'' as having derived from ancient observation.

==Galileo's attempt to explain the tides==
[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|left|Justus Sustermans – Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636]]
[[File:Galileo Theory of Tides.gif|thumb|right|"The greater circle represents the orbit of the Earth around the Sun...while the smaller one is the rotating Earth itself" (Palmeri 1998, p. 229).]]

In 1616, [[Galileo Galilei]] wrote ''[[Discourse on the Tides]]'' (''Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare''),&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"&gt;[[Rice University]]: [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/tides.html Galileo's Theory of the Tides], by Rossella Gigli, retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter to [[Alessandro Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]]. In this discourse, he tried to explain the occurrence of the tides as the result of the [[Earth]]'s rotation and [[heliocentrism|revolution around the Sun]]. Galileo believed that the oceans moved like water in a large basin: as the basin moves, so does the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first=Peter|title=Galileo's Big Mistake|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/galileo-big-mistake.html|website=NOVA|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as the Earth revolves, the force of the Earth's rotation causes the oceans to "alternately accelerate and retardate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view on the oscillation and "alternately accelerated and retardated" motion of the Earth's rotation is a "dynamic process" that deviated from the previous dogma, which proposed "a process of expansion and contraction of seawater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmeri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galileo's theory was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"/&gt;  In subsequent centuries, [[Tide#Analysis|further analysis]] led to the current tidal physics. Galileo rejected Kepler's explanation of the tides.

== Newton ==

Newton, in the ''Principia'', provided a correct explanation for the [[tidal force]], which can be used to explain tides on a planet covered by a uniform ocean, but which takes no account of the distribution of the continents or ocean bathymetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410173511/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dynamic theory of Laplace==
The dynamic theory of tides describes and predicts the actual real behavior of ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearsonhighered.com/samplechapter/0132401223.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Newton's three-body diagram.PNG|400px|right|Newton's three-body model]]
While [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the ''dynamic theory of tides'', developed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/2011112017524/short-notes-on-the-dynamical-theory-of-laplace.html&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ocean's real reaction to [[Tidal force|tidal forces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/luanne/pages/ocean420/notes/tidedynamics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account [[friction]], [[resonance]] and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large [[amphidromic]] systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kess/JGGHBA/2009/v30n5/JGGHBA_2009_v30n5_671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanho.co.za/tides/tide_theory.pdf Tidal theory] website South African Navy Hydrographic Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/swojtal/SFWpage/161Stuff/161Lect17/sld012.htm |title=Dynamic theory for tides |publisher=Oberlin.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/645fall2003_web.dir/ellie_boyce/dynamic.htm|title=  Dynamic Theory of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |title=Dynamic Tides – In contrast to "static" theory, the dynamic theory of tides recognizes that water covers only three-quarters o |publisher=Web.vims.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113022202/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |title=The Dynamic Theory of Tides |publisher=Coa.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219161027/http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beacon.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Tides.html |title=Tides – building, river, sea, depth, oceans, effects, important, largest, system, wave, effect, marine, Pacific |publisher=Waterencyclopedia.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/wormuth/tidestxt.html |title=TIDES |publisher=Ocean.tamu.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floor Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/tides.htm |title=Tides |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are up to 15 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tidal-intro/cause-nature|title=  The Cause &amp; Nature of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/stories/topex/tides.html |title=Scientific Visualization Studio TOPEX/Poseidon images |publisher=Svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SVS-1333 |title=TOPEX/Poseidon Western Hemisphere: Tide Height Model : NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements from the [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] satellite closely match the models based on the [[TOPEX]] data.&lt;ref&gt;TOPEX data used to model actual tides for 15 days from the year 2000 |url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a001300/a001332/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geomag.us/info/Ocean/m2_CHAMP+longwave_SSH.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/ |title=OSU Tidal Data Inversion |publisher=Volkov.oce.orst.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|title=   Dynamic and residual ocean tide analysis for improved GRACE de-aliasing (DAROTA)|deadurl=   yes|archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194935/http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|archivedate=   2 April 2015|df=   dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] formulated a single set of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, for tidal flow described as a [[barotropic]] two-dimensional sheet flow. [[Coriolis effect]]s are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the [[fluid dynamic]] equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via [[Lagrange's equation]].

For a fluid sheet of [[average]] thickness ''D'', the vertical tidal elevation ''ζ'', as well as the horizontal velocity components ''u'' and ''v'' (in the [[latitude]] ''φ'' and [[longitude]] ''λ'' directions, respectively) satisfy '''Laplace's tidal equations''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/LTE.frame.pdf|title= The Laplace Tidal Equations and Atmospheric Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  \begin{align} 
    \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}
    &amp;+ \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \left[
           \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} (uD)
         + \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left(vD \cos( \varphi )\right)  
       \right]
     = 0,
     \\[2ex]
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
   &amp;- v \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0 
    \qquad \text{and} \\[2ex]
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
   &amp;+ u \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a} \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0,
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] of the planet's rotation, ''g'' is the planet's gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, ''a'' is the planetary radius, and ''U'' is the external gravitational tidal-forcing [[potential]].

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] to find an equation for [[vorticity]]. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.

==Tidal analysis and prediction==

===Harmonic analysis===
[[File:Tides Fourier Transform.png|300px|thumb|Fourier transform of tides measured at Ft. Pulaski in 2012.  Data downloaded from http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=8670870 Fourier transform computed with https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/]]

Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state. This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s application of [[Fourier analysis]] to the tidal motions as [[harmonic analysis]].

Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by [[George Darwin]], applying the lunar theory current in his time. Darwin's symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used.

Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later improved when [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A T Doodson]], applying the [[lunar theory]] of [[Ernest William Brown|E W Brown]],&lt;ref name=dec2001&gt;D E Cartwright, "Tides: a scientific history", Cambridge University Press 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sSesNjG96JYC&amp;pg=PA163 at pages 163-4].&lt;/ref&gt; developed the tide-generating potential (TGP) in harmonic form, distinguishing 388 tidal frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;S Casotto, F Biscani, "A fully analytical approach to the harmonic development of the tide-generating potential accounting for precession, nutation, and perturbations due to figure and planetary terms", AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy, April 2004, vol.36(2), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Doodson's work was carried out and published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;A T Doodson (1921), "The Harmonic Development of the Tide-Generating Potential", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Vol. 100, No. 704 (Dec. 1, 1921), pp. 305-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doodson devised a practical system for specifying the different harmonic components of the tide-generating potential, the [[Arthur Thomas Doodson#Doodson numbers|Doodson numbers]], a system still in use.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T D Moyer (2003), "Formulation for observed and computed values of Deep Space Network data types for navigation", vol.3 in Deep-space communications and navigation series, Wiley (2003), e.g. at pp.126-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-twentieth century further analysis has generated many more terms than Doodson's 388.  About 62 constituents are of sufficient size to be considered for possible use in marine tide prediction, but sometimes many fewer can predict tides to useful accuracy.  The calculations of tide predictions using the harmonic constituents are laborious, and from the 1870s to about the 1960s they were carried out using a mechanical [[tide-predicting machine]], a special-purpose form of [[analog computer]] now superseded in this work by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out the same computations.

===Tidal constituents===
Tidal constituents combine to give an endlessly varying aggregate because of their different and incommensurable frequencies: the effect is visualized in an [http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/tidesIII3.html animation of the American Mathematical Society] illustrating the way in which the components used to be mechanically combined in the [[tide-predicting machine]].  Amplitudes of tidal constituents are given below for six example locations:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16572">The '''UAH satellite temperature dataset''', developed at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], infers the temperature of various atmospheric layers from [[satellite]] measurements of [[radiance]].

It was the first global temperature datasets developed from satellite information and has been used as a tool for research into surface and atmospheric temperature changes.
The dataset is published by [[John Christy]] et al. and formerly jointly with [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]].

==Satellite temperature measurements==
{{Main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
[[Satellite]]s do not measure [[temperature]] directly.  They measure [[radiance]]s in various [[wavelength]] bands, from which temperature may be [[Remote sensing#Data processing|inferred]].&lt;ref name="NRC2000"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I. Science and Design |author=National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Earth Studies |year=2000 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-51527-0 |pages=17–24 |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9963&amp;page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uddstrom1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uddstrom |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year=1988 |title=Retrieval of Atmospheric Profiles from Satellite Radiance Data by Typical Shape Function Maximum a Posteriori Simultaneous Retrieval Estimators |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=515&amp;ndash;549 |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1988)027&lt;0515:ROAPFS&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url= |accessdate= |bibcode = 1988JApMe..27..515U }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances. As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have obtained different temperature data. Among these groups are [[Remote Sensing Systems]] (RSS) and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The satellite series is not fully homogeneous - it is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation. The sensors deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for satellite drift and orbital decay. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

==Description of the data==

UAH provide data on three broad levels of the atmosphere.
*The Lower [[troposphere]] - '''TLT''' (originally called '''T2LT''').
*The mid troposphere - '''TMT'''
*The lower stratosphere - '''TLS'''&lt;ref name=UAH_MSU_DOC&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MSU DATA FILES|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/docs/readme.msu|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data are provided as temperature anomalies against the seasonal average over a past basis period, as well as in absolute temperature values.

All the data products can be downloaded from the UAH server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UAH MSU Data|url=http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic coverage===

Data are available as global, hemispheric, zonal, and gridded averages. The global average covers 97-98% of the earth's surface, excluding only latitudes above +85 degrees, below -85 degrees and, in the cases of TLT and TMT, some areas with land above 1500&amp;nbsp;m altitude. The hemispheric averages are over the northern and southern hemispheres 0 to +/-85 degrees. The gridded data provide an almost global temperature map.&lt;ref name=UAH_MSU_DOC/&gt;

===Temporal coverage===

Daily global, hemispheric and zonal data are available.
Monthly averages are available in gridded format as well as by hemisphere and globally.

Each set has data back to December 1978.

==Comparison with other data and models==

[[General circulation model|Climate model]]s predict that as the surface warms, so should the global troposphere. Globally, the troposphere should warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing [[algorithm]]) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm United Nations Environment Programme] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112044011/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm |date=12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis produced by dozens of scientists as part of the US [[Climate Change Science Program]] (CCSP) identified and corrected errors in a variety of temperature observations, including the satellite data.

The [http://downloads.globalchange.gov/sap/sap1-1/sap1-1-final-all.pdf CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary] states:
:"Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human induced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."

The [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers] states:
:"New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR."

However, as detailed in [https://web.archive.org/web/20101224095341/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap5.pdf CCSP SAP 5.1 Understanding and Reconciling Differences], neither Regression models or other related techniques were reconcilable with observed data.  The use of fingerprinting techniques on data yielded that "Volcanic and human-caused fingerprints were not consistently identifiable in observed patterns of lapse rate change."  As such, issues with reconciling data and models remain.

A potentially serious inconsistency has been identified in the tropics, the area in which tropospheric amplification should be seen. Section 1.1 of the CCSP report says:

: "In the tropics, the agreement between models and observations depends on the time scale considered. For month-to-month and year-to-year variations, models and observations both show amplification (i.e., the month-to-month and year-to-year variations are larger aloft than at the surface). This is a consequence of relatively simple physics, the effects of the release of latent heat as air rises and condenses in clouds. The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations. On decadal and longer time scales, however, while almost all model simulations show greater warming aloft (reflecting the same physical processes that operate on the monthly and annual time scales), most observations show greater warming at the surface.

: "These results could arise either because "real world" amplification effects on short and long time scales are controlled by different physical mechanisms, and models fail to capture such behavior; or because non-climatic influences remaining in some or all of the observed tropospheric data sets lead to biased long-term trends; or a combination of these factors. The new evidence in this Report favors the second explanation."

The lower troposphere trend derived from UAH satellites (+0.128&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is currently lower than both the GISS and Hadley Centre surface station network trends (+0.161 and +0.160&amp;nbsp;°C/decade respectively), while the RSS trend (+0.158&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is similar. The surface station data indicate a trend of around 0.194&amp;nbsp;°C/decade{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, making the UAH and RSS trends 66% and 81% of the surface station derived value respectively.

For some time, the UAH satellite data's chief significance was that they appeared to contradict a wide range of surface temperature data measurements and analyses showing warming. In 1998 the UAH data showed a ''cooling'' of 0.05&amp;nbsp;K per decade (at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km - mid to low troposphere). Wentz &amp; Schabel at RSS in their 1998 paper showed this (along with other discrepancies) was due to the orbital decay of the NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115152656/http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |archive-date=15 January 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the orbital changes had been allowed for the data showed a 0.07&amp;nbsp;K per decade ''increase'' in temperature at this level of the atmosphere.

The UAH TLT dataset was a source of controversy in the 1990s as, at that time, it showed little increase in global mean temperature, at odds with surface measurements. Since then a number of errors in the way the atmospheric temperatures were derived from the raw radiance data have been discovered and corrections made by Christy et al. at UAH.

The largest of these errors was demonstrated in a 1998 paper by [[Frank Wentz]] and [[Matthias Schabel]] of [[Remote Sensing Systems|RSS]]. In that paper they showed that the data needed to be corrected for orbital decay of the MSU satellites. As the satellites' orbits gradually decayed towards the earth the area from which they received radiances was reduced, introducing a false cooling trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wentz|first=Frank J.|author2=Matthias Schabel |journal=Letters to Nature|date=13 August 1998|volume=394|pages=661-661|title=Effects of orbital decay on satellite-derived lower-tropospheric temperature trends|doi=10.1038/29267|bibcode = 1998Natur.394..661W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the correction for satellite decay UAH continued to infer lower TLT temperatures than RSS based on the same raw data. For example, Mears et al. at RSS found 0.193&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123&amp;nbsp;°C/decade found by UAH for the same period.

Much of the remaining disparity was resolved by the three papers in Science, 11 August 2005, which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/08/et-tu-lt/&lt;/ref&gt;

NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears ''et al.'' identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2.&lt;ref name="Mears2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mears |first=Carl A. |authorlink= |author2=Wentz, Frank J.  |year=2005 |title=The Effect of Diurnal Correction on Satellite-Derived Lower Tropospheric Temperature |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5740 |pages=1548&amp;ndash;1551 |doi=10.1126/science.1114772 |url= |accessdate= |quote=|pmid=16141071 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1548M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy ''et al.'' asserted in a 2007 paper that the tropical temperature trends from [[radiosondes]] matches more closely with their v5.2 UAH-TLT dataset than with RSS v2.1.&lt;ref name="Christy2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=J.

Much of the difference, at least in the Lower troposphere global average decadal trend between UAH and RSS, has been removed with the release of RSS version 3.3 in January 2011. RSS and UAH TLT are now within 0.003&amp;nbsp;K/decade of one another. Significant differences remained, however, in the Mid Troposphere (TMT) decadal trends. However, in June 2017 RSS released version 4 which significantly increased the trend from 0.136 to 0.184&amp;nbsp;K/decade substantially increasing the difference again.

A beta version of 6.0 of the dataset was released on April 28, 2015 via blog post.&lt;ref name="Version6.0beta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drroyspencer.com/2015/04/version-6-0-of-the-uah-temperature-dataset-released-new-lt-trend-0-11-cdecade/|title=Version 6.0 of the UAH Temperature Dataset Released: New LT Trend = +0.11 C/decade|accessdate=2017-01-11 |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This dataset has higher spacial resolution and uses new methods for gridpoint averaging.

[[File:Usine Bret MG 1638.jpg|thumb|Control room and schematics of the water purification plant to [[Lac de Bret]], Switzerland]]

'''Water purification''' is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is disinfected for human consumption ([[drinking water]]), but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes, including fulfilling the requirements of medical, pharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as [[filtration]], [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]], and [[distillation]]; biological processes such as [[slow sand filters]] or [[activated carbon|biologically active carbon]]; chemical processes such as [[flocculation]] and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet light]].

Purifying water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] [[Particle (ecology)|particle]]s, [[parasite]]s, [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], as well as reducing the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter.

The standards for drinking [[water quality]] are typically set by governments or by international standards. These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended purpose of water use.

Visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality. Simple procedures such as [[boiling]] or the use of a household [[activated carbon]] filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring water]] – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. [[Analytical chemistry|Chemical]] and [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]], while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.

According to a 2007 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report, 1.1 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] people lack access to an improved drinking water supply; 88% of the 4 billion annual cases of [[diarrhea|diarrheal disease]] are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate [[sanitation]] and hygiene, while 1.8 million people die from diarrheal disease each year. The WHO estimates that 94% of these diarrheal disease cases are preventable through modifications to the environment, including access to safe water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/combating_diseasepart1lowres.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Combating Waterborne Diseases at the Household Level |at=Part 1 |year=2007|isbn=978-92-4-159522-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple techniques for treating water at home, such as chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/waterforlife.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organization and [[UNICEF]] |title=Water for Life: Making it Happen |year=2005 |isbn=978-92-4-156293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing deaths from [[waterborne diseases]] is a major [[public health]] goal in developing countries.

==Sources of water==
{{further|Water supply}}
#[[Groundwater]]: The water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago. [[Soil]] and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to a high degree of clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding [[chlorine]] or [[chloramines]] as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, [[Artesian aquifer|artesian spring]]s, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high [[bacteria|bacteriological]] quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially [[carbonate]]s and [[sulfate]]s of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]. Depending on the [[Stratum|strata]] through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including [[chloride]], and [[bicarbonate]]. There may be a requirement to reduce the [[iron]] or [[manganese]] content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary [[disinfection]] may also be required. Where [[groundwater recharge]] is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.
#Upland [[lake]]s and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]: Typically located in the headwaters of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, [[protozoa]] or [[algae]] will be present. Where uplands are forested or peaty, [[humic acid]]s can colour the water. Many upland sources have low [[pH]] which require adjustment.
#[[River]]s, [[canal]]s and low land reservoirs: Low land surface waters will have a significant bacterial load and may also contain algae, suspended solids and a variety of dissolved constituents.
#[[Atmospheric water generator|Atmospheric water generation]] is a new technology that can provide high quality drinking water by extracting water from the air by cooling the air and thus condensing water vapor.
#[[Rainwater harvesting]] or [[fog collection]] which collect water from the atmosphere can be used especially in areas with significant dry seasons and in areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
#[[Desalination]] of [[seawater]] by [[distillation]] or [[reverse osmosis]].
#[[Surface Water]]:  Freshwater bodies that are open to the atmosphere and are not designated as groundwater are termed surface waters.

==Treatment==

=== Goals ===
The goals of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications. Widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids, micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials, or [[Environmental Persistent Pharmaceutical Pollutant|environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants]]. The choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated, the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water.

The processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants. Some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw (source) water.

===Pretreatment===
#Pumping and containment – The majority of water must be pumped from its source or directed into pipes or holding tanks. To avoid adding contaminants to the water, this physical infrastructure must be made from appropriate materials and constructed so that accidental contamination does not occur.
#Screening (''see also [[screen filter]]'') – The first step in purifying surface water is to remove large debris such as sticks, leaves, rubbish and other large particles which may interfere with subsequent purification steps. Most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps.
#Storage – Water from rivers may also be stored in [[bankside reservoirs]] for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. This is especially important if treatment is by [[slow sand filter]]s. Storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory [[Water pollution|pollution]] incidents in the source river.
#Pre-chlorination – In many plants the incoming water was chlorinated to minimize the growth of fouling organisms on the pipe-work and tanks. Because of the potential adverse quality effects (see chlorine below), this has largely been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Michael J.|last2=McLain|first2=Jennifer Lara|last3=Obolensky|first3=Alexa|title=Information Collection Rule Data Analysis|date=2002|publisher=AWWA Research Foundation and American Water Works Association|location=Denver|isbn=9781583212738|pages=376–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQhSAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====pH adjustment====
Pure water has a [[pH]] close to 7 (neither [[alkaline]] nor [[acidic]]). [[Sea water]] can have  pH values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the [[drainage basin]] or [[aquifer]] and the influence of contaminant inputs ([[acid rain]]). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[soda ash]], or [[sodium hydroxide]] can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft [[Degasification|degasifiers]] can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeration and gas stripping|url=https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|accessdate=29 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712085937/https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making the water alkaline helps [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulation]] and [[flocculation]] processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of [[lead]] being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead [[solder]] in pipe fittings.  Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid ([[carbonic acid gas|carbonic acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water.  The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Knowledge|url=https://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-knowledge.aspx|website=American Water Works Association|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coagulation and flocculation===
{{See also|particle aggregation}}

One of the first steps in most conventional water purification processes is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water.  Particles can be inorganic such as [[clay]] and [[silt]] or organic such as [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]] and [[natural organic matter]].  Inorganic and organic particles contribute to the [[turbidity]] and color of water.

The addition of inorganic coagulants such as [[aluminum sulfate]] (or [[alum#industrial|alum]]) or iron (III) salts such as [[iron(III) chloride]] cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles.  Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants.  Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form.  These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as [[Brownian motion]] and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as [[flocculation]].  Amorphous metal hydroxides are known as "floc". Large, amorphous aluminum and iron (III) hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] and [[water filter|filtration]].&lt;ref name=Edzwald&gt;Edzwald, James K., ed. (2011). ''Water Quality and Treatment.'' 6th Edition. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-163011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8.2–8.3}}

Aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow pH range, typically:  5.5 to about 7.7.  Iron (III) hydroxides can form over a larger pH range including pH levels lower than are effective for alum, typically:  5.0 to 8.5.&lt;ref name=Crittenden&gt;Crittenden, John C., et al., eds. (2005). ''Water Treatment:  Principles and Design.'' 2nd Edition. Hoboken, NJ:Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-11018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|679}}

In the literature, there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation: Where does coagulation end and flocculation begin?  In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) whereby the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc.  In fact, coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added.&lt;ref name=Kawamura&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kawamura|first1=Susumu|title=Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471350934|pages=74–75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOQKKRUNGrwC|date=2000-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–5}}

Organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and, in some cases, as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants.  Synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative, positive or neutral charges.  When organic polymers are added to water with particulates, the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc.  [[PolyDADMAC]] is a popular cationic (positively charged) organic polymer used in water purification plants.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|667–8}}

===Sedimentation===
Waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the [[settling basin|sedimentation basin]], also called a clarifier or settling basin. It is a large tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.

In 1904, [[Allen Hazen]] showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity, the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank. Sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot (or 1.25 to 2.5 meters per hour).  In general, sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin.  Although, basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted.  As particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank, settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles.  Typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters).&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.39–9.40}}&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|790–1}}&lt;ref name=Kawamura/&gt;{{rp|140–2, 171}}

Inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance.  Inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with Hazen's original theory.  The amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin.

====Sludge storage and removal====

As particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin, a layer of [[sludge]] is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated. The amount of sludge generated is significant, often 3 to 5 percent of the total volume of water to be treated. The cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant. The sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom,  or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually.

====Floc blanket clarifiers====

A subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward.  The major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation.  Disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|835–6}}

===Dissolved air flotation===
When particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is often used.   After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc.  The floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the DAF tank.
Water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ DAF.
&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.46}}

===Filtration===
After separating most floc, the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc.

====Rapid sand filters====
[[File:Rapid sand filter EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Cutaway view of a typical rapid sand filter]]
The most common type of filter is a [[rapid sand filter]]. Water moves vertically through sand which often has a layer of [[activated carbon]] or [[anthracite coal]] above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.&lt;ref name="EPA1990"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(1990). Cincinnati, OH. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=300048WU.txt "Technologies for Upgrading Existing or Designing New Drinking Water Treatment Facilities."] Document no. EPA/625/4-89/023.&lt;/ref&gt;

To clean the filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, opposite the normal direction (called ''backflushing'' or ''[[Backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]]'') to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as ''air scouring''. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.

Some water treatment plants employ pressure filters. These work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters, differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure.

Advantages:

* Filters out much smaller particles than paper and sand filters can.
* Filters out virtually all particles larger than their specified pore sizes.
* They are quite thin and so liquids flow through them fairly rapidly.
* They are reasonably strong and so can withstand pressure differences across them of typically 2–5 atmospheres.
* They can be cleaned (back flushed) and reused.

====Slow sand filters====
[[File:Vsakovací nádrže umělé infiltrace v ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|Slow "artificial" filtration (a variation of [[bank filtration]]) to the ground, Water purification plant Káraný, Czech Republic]]
[[File:Slow sand filter profile.jpg|thumb|A profile of layers of gravel, sand and fine sand used in a slow sand filter plant.]]

[[Slow sand filter]]s may be used where there is sufficient land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, at the bottom and finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or [[Schmutzdecke]], on the surface of the filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nair|first=Abhilash T.|last2=Ahammed|first2=M. Mansoor|last3=Davra|first3=Komal|date=2014-08-01|title=Influence of operating parameters on the performance of a household slow sand filter|journal=Water Science and Technology: Water Supply|volume=14|issue=4|pages=643–649|doi=10.2166/ws.2014.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific "large-scale" form of slow sand filter is the process of [[bank filtration]], in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration. While typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water, the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the major streams where bank filtration is often used.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Membrane filtration===
[[Membrane technology|Membrane filters]] are widely used for filtering both drinking water and [[sewage]]. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2&amp;nbsp;μm—including ''[[giardia]]'' and ''[[cryptosporidium]].'' Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream. They are widely used in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including [[bottled water]]). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as [[phosphates]], [[nitrate]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] ions.

===Removal of ions and other dissolved substances===
[[Ultrafiltration]] [[artificial membrane|membranes]] use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants. The type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Ion exchange]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zagorodni, Andrei A. |title=Ion exchange materials: properties and applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfDFKl3I74MC|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion exchange systems use [[ion exchange resin]]- or [[zeolite]]-packed columns to replace unwanted ions. The most common case is [[water softening]] consisting of removal of [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[ion]]s replacing them with benign (soap friendly) [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions. Ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as [[nitrite]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]] and many others.

[[Lime softening|Precipitative softening]]:&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|13.12–13.58}}  Water rich in [[hard water|hardness]] ([[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ions) is treated with lime ([[calcium oxide]]) and/or soda-ash ([[sodium carbonate]]) to precipitate [[calcium carbonate]] out of solution utilizing the [[common-ion effect]].

[[Electrodeionization]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"/&gt; Water is passed between a positive [[electrode]] and a negative electrode. Ion exchange [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membranes]] allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible if the right conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a [[reverse osmosis]] unit to remove non-ionic [[organic contaminants]], and with gas transfer membranes to remove [[carbon dioxide]]. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.

===Disinfection===
[[File:Chemical pumps at water purification plant.JPG|thumb|Pumps used to add required amount of chemicals to the clear water at the water purification plant before the distribution. From left to right: sodium hypochlorite for disinfection, zinc orthophosphate as a corrosion inhibitor, sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment, and fluoride for tooth decay prevention.]]

Disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and also by adding disinfectant chemicals. Water is disinfected to kill any [[pathogens]] which pass through the filters and to  provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems.  Possible pathogens include [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], including  ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Cholera]]'',  ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'', and [[protozoa]], including ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and other ''[[cryptosporidia]]''.  Following the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent, the water is usually held in temporary storage – often called a contact tank or [[clear well]] to allow the disinfecting action to complete.

====Chlorine disinfection====
{{Main|Water chlorination}}
The most common disinfection method involves some form of [[chlorine]] or its compounds such as [[chloramine]] or [[chlorine dioxide]]. Chlorine is a strong [[oxidizer|oxidant]] that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, there is a danger of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of [[sodium hypochlorite]], which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, [[calcium hypochlorite]], releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (4 parts per million) are considered safe in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/chlorine-disinfection.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=11 February 2018|title=Disinfection with Chlorine &amp;#124; Public Water Systems &amp;#124; Drinking Water &amp;#124; Healthy Water }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of chlorine are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, [[trihalomethane]]s (THMs) and [[haloacetic acid]]s (HAAs), are both [[carcinogenic]] in large quantities and are regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against pathogenic protozoa that form cysts in water such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''.

====Chlorine dioxide disinfection====
[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine. It is relatively rarely used, because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of [[chlorite]], which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the United States. Chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate.

====Chloramine disinfection====
The use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine and it will not readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding [[ammonia]] to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience [[nitrification]], as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.

====Ozone disinfection====
[[Ozone]] is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It is a very strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe. It is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a "cold" electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]). Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in [[Nice]], France. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods. However, although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation, it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]].  Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neemann, Jeff |author2=Hulsey, Robert |author3=Rexing, David |author4=Wert, Eric |year=2004|title=Controlling Bromate Formation During Ozonation with Chlorine and Ammonia|journal=Journal American Water Works Association|volume= 96|issue=2 |pages=26–29|doi=10.1002/j.1551-8833.2004.tb10542.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ultraviolet disinfection====
{{main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|Ultraviolet light]] (UV) is very effective at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, a result of the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]], and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.

Over 2 million people in 28 developing countries use Solar Disinfection for daily drinking water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/solardisinfection.html|website=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=11 February 2018|title=Solar Disinfection &amp;#124; the Safe Water System }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable water purification===
{{main|Portable water purification}}
Potable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations. Disinfection is the primary goal, since aesthetic considerations such as taste, odour, appearance, and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water.

===Additional treatment options===
#[[Water fluoridation]]: in many areas [[fluoride]] is added to water with the goal of preventing [[tooth decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental decay caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=50 |issue=RR-14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm |laysummary=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/tooth_decay.htm |laysource=CDC |laydate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process.

#Water conditioning: This is a method of reducing the effects of hard water. In water systems subject to heating hardness salts can be deposited as the decomposition of bicarbonate ions creates carbonate ions that precipitate out of  solution. Water with high concentrations of hardness salts can be treated with soda ash (sodium carbonate) which precipitates out the excess salts, through the [[common-ion effect]], producing calcium carbonate of very high purity. The precipitated calcium carbonate is traditionally sold to the manufacturers of [[toothpaste]]. Several other methods of industrial and residential water treatment are claimed (without general scientific acceptance) to include the use of magnetic and/or electrical fields reducing the effects of hard water.&lt;ref&gt;Penn State Extension [http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/drinking-water/water-testing/water-treatment/magnetic-water-treatment-devices "Magnetic Water Treatment Devices"] Accessed 15.08.2017&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Plumbosolvency]] reduction: In areas with naturally acidic waters of low conductivity (i.e. surface rainfall in upland mountains of [[igneous]] rocks), the water may be capable of dissolving [[lead]] from any lead pipes that it is carried in. The addition of small quantities of [[phosphate]] ion and increasing the [[pH]] slightly both assist in greatly reducing plumbo-solvency by creating insoluble lead salts on the inner surfaces of the pipes.
#Radium Removal: Some groundwater sources contain [[radium]], a radioactive chemical element. Typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the [[Illinois River]] in [[Illinois]]. Radium can be removed by ion exchange, or by water conditioning. The back flush or sludge that is produced is, however, a low-level [[radioactive waste]].
#Fluoride Removal: Although fluoride is added to water in many areas, some areas of the world have excessive levels of natural fluoride in the source water. Excessive levels can be [[Fluoride toxicity|toxic]] or cause undesirable cosmetic effects such as staining of teeth. Methods of reducing fluoride levels is through treatment with [[activated alumina]] and [[bone char]] filter media.

==Other water purification techniques==
Other popular methods for purifying water, especially for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries some of these methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (de-salination of seawater) and reverse osmosis.

# [[Boiled Water|Boiling]]: Bringing water to its [[boiling point]] (about 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212 F at sea level), is the oldest and most effective way since it eliminates most [[microbes]] causing [[intestine]] related diseases,&lt;ref name=Oxfordjournals&gt;{{cite journal|title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers|author=Backer, Howard |pages=355–364|doi=10.1086/324747|year=2002| journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume= 34 |issue=3 |pmid=11774083}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot remove [[toxins|chemical toxins]] or impurities.&lt;ref name="backpackers field manual"&gt;Curtis, Rick (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml OA Guide to Water Purification, The Backpacker's Field Manual], Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; For human health, complete [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of water is not required, since the heat resistant microbes are not intestine affecting.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt; The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than {{convert|60|°C}}. Though the [[Atmospheric pressure boiling point|boiling point decreases]] with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that you can't make a decent cup of tea up a mountain?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/air-tea.asp|publisher=physics.org| accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where the water is "hard" (that is, containing significant dissolved calcium salts), boiling decomposes the [[bicarbonate]] ions, resulting in partial precipitation as [[calcium carbonate]]. This is the "fur" that builds up on kettle elements, etc., in hard water areas. With the exception of calcium, boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration (due to some water being lost as vapour). Boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water. Therefore, water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens.
# Granular Activated Carbon adsorption: a form of [[activated carbon]] with a high surface area, adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds. Water passing through [[activated carbon]] is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination, taste or odors. Many household water filters and fish tanks use activated carbon filters to further purify the water. Household filters for drinking water sometimes contain [[silver]] as metallic [[silver nanoparticle]]. If water is held in the carbon block for longer periods, microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination. Silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and they can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Nora|author2=Mamadou S. Diallo |title=Nanomaterials and Water Purification: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=J.

#[[Distillation]] involves boiling the water to produce water [[vapour]]. The vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid. Because the solutes are not normally vaporised, they remain in the boiling solution. Even distillation does not completely purify water, because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam. However, 99.9% pure water can be obtained by distillation.
#[[Reverse osmosis]]: Mechanical pressure is applied to an impure solution to force pure water through a [[semi-permeable membrane]]. Reverse osmosis is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, [[algae]] and other life forms can colonize the membranes.
# The use of iron in removing arsenic from water. See [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater]].
# Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along the surface of a [[hydrophobic]] [[polymer]] membrane. Evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.
#[[Desalination]] –  is a process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. The most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis. Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination. It is only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas.  
# Gas hydrate crystals centrifuge method. If carbon dioxide or other low molecular weight gas is mixed with contaminated water at high pressure and low temperature, gas hydrate crystals will form exothermically. Separation of the crystalline hydrate may be performed by centrifuge or sedimentation and decanting. Water can be released from the hydrate crystals by heating&lt;ref&gt;Osegovic, John P. ''et al.''

#[[In situ oxidation|In Situ Chemical Oxidation]], a form of advanced oxidation processes and advanced oxidation technology, is an environmental remediation technique used for soil and/or groundwater remediation to reduce the concentrations of targeted environmental contaminants to acceptable levels. ISCO is accomplished by injecting or otherwise introducing strong chemical oxidizers directly into the contaminated medium (soil or groundwater) to destroy chemical contaminants in place. It can be used to remediate a variety of organic compounds, including some that are resistant to natural degradation
#[[Bioremediation]] is a technique that uses microorganisms in order to remove or extract certain waste products from a contaminated area.  Since 1991 bioremediation has been a suggested tactic to remove impurities from water such as alkanes, perchlorates, and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wilson|first=John T.

Many municipalities have moved from free chlorine to chloramine as a disinfection agent. However, chloramine appears to be a corrosive agent in some water systems. Chloramine can dissolve the "protective" film inside older service lines, leading to the leaching of lead into residential spigots. This can result in harmful exposure, including elevated [[blood lead levels]]. Lead is a known [[neurotoxin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Demineralized water===
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water which is not considered ideal [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization has investigated the health effects of demineralized water since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutdemineralized.pdf Health risks from drinking demineralised water]. (PDF) . Rolling revision of the WHO Guidelines for
drinking-water quality. World Health Organization, Geneva, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[Fluid balance|diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased [[blood serum]] [[potassium]] concentration. [[Magnesium]], [[calcium]], and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]]/[[liter|L]] with 20–30&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40–80&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total [[water hardness]] (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;[[millimole|mmol]]/L. At water hardness above 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed.&lt;ref name=Demineralized2004&gt;Kozisek F.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:Jakob Ziegler 1799 Bemerkungen über gemeines Wasser detail.jpg | thumb|Drawing of an apparatus for studying the chemical analysis of mineral waters in a book from 1799.]]
The first experiments into water filtration were made in the 17th century. Sir [[Francis Bacon]] attempted to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water by passing the flow through a [[sand filter]]. Although his experiment did not succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field. The fathers of [[microscopy]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and [[Robert Hooke]], used the newly invented [[microscope]] to observe for the first time small material particles that lay suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwaterfilters.com/microscope-in-water.html|title=The Use of the Microscope in Water Filter History|work=History of Water Filters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sand filter===
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]. ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream and common, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunn, S. William A.  |author2=Masellis, Michele  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-72264-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bazin, Hervé |title=L'histoire des vaccinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2008|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]]. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

===Water chlorination===
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was the first to successfully use [[chlorine]] to [[water chlorination|disinfect the water supply]] in [[Soho]] that had helped spread the cholera outbreak. William Soper also used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by [[typhoid]] patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, [[Moritz Traube]] formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) to water to render it "germ-free."  Two other investigators confirmed Traube's findings and published their papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Turneaure, F.E. |author2=H.L. Russell  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1901 | title = Public Water-Supplies:  Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works | edition = 1st | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | page = 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] and in 1897 the city of [[Maidstone]] [[England]] was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|thumb|Manual-control chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100–9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.  The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York:Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account: {{quote|It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Nesfield, V. B. |title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|volume=15|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Army Major [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40886">The existence of a '''wood economy''', or more broadly, a '''forest economy''' (since in many countries a [[bamboo economy]] predominates), is a prominent matter in many [[developing countries]] as well as in many other nations with temperate climate and especially in those with [[Boreal climate|low temperatures]]. These are generally the countries with greater [[forest]]ed areas. The uses of wood in furniture, buildings, bridges, and as a source of energy are widely known. Additionally, wood from [[tree]]s and [[Shrub|bushes]], can be employed in a wide variety, including those produced from [[wood pulp]], as [[cellulose]] in paper, [[celluloid]] in early [[photographic]] film, [[cellophane]], and [[rayon]] (a substitute for silk).

At the end of their normal usage, wood products can be burnt to obtain [[thermal energy]], or can be used as a [[fertilizer]]. The potential environmental damage that a wood economy could occasion include (problems of reduction the [[biodiversity]] due to [[monoculture]] forestry—the intensive cultivation of very few types of trees); and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. However, forests can aid in reduction of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and therefore decrease [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestadaptation2008.net/home/en/|title=Adaptation of Forests and Forest Management to Changing Climate with Emphasis on Forest Health: a Review of Science, Policies, and Practices.

== Introduction ==

=== History of use of wood ===
The wood economy is historically the starting point of the [[civilization]]s worldwide, since eras preceding the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. It necessarily preceded [[Bronze Age|ages of metals]] by many millenia, as the melting of metals was possible only through the discovery of techniques to light [[fire]] (usually obtained by the scraping of two very dry wooden rods) and the building of many [[simple machine]]s and rudimentary tools, as canes, club handles, [[Bow (weapon)|bows]], [[arrow]]s, [[lance]]s. One of the most ancient handmade articles ever found is one smoothed pricked of wood (Clacton Spear) 250,000 years old (third interglacial period), that was buried under sediments in England, at [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Tecnologia Dalle Origini al 2000, pag. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clacton Spear |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |archivedate=October 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive civilizations such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Sumer|Sumerians]] built sophisticated [[Furniture|objects of furniture]]. Many types of furniture in [[ivory]] and valuable woods have survived to our time practically intact, because secluded in inviolated secret tombs, they were protected from decay also by the dry environment of desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |title=History of Egyptian Furniture |date=27 October 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027112058/http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings and parts of these (above all roofs) contained elements in wood (often of [[oak]]) forming structural supports and covering; means of transport such as boats, ships; and later (with the invention of the [[wheel]]) wagons and carriages, winches, flour mills powered by water, etc.

=== Dimensions and geography ===
The main source of the lumber used in the world is [[forest]]s, which can be classified as [[Virgin forest|virgin]], [[Semivirgin forests|semivirgin]] and [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. Much [[timber]] is removed for [[firewood]] by local populations in many countries, especially in the [[third world]], but this amount can only be estimated, with wide margins of uncertainty.

In 1998, the worldwide production of "roundwood" (officially counted wood not used as firewood), was about {{convert|1,500,000,000|m3|cuyd}}, amounting to around 45% of the wood cultivated in the world. Cut logs and branches destined to become elements for building construction accounted for approximately 55% of the world's [[wood industry|industrial]] [[wood production]]. 25% became [[wood pulp]] (including wood powder and truccioli) mainly destined for the production of [[paper]] and [[paperboard]], and approximately 20% became panels in [[plywood]] and valuable wood for furnitures and objects of common use (FAO 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 FAO 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724193223/http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest producer and consumer of officially accounted wood is the United States, although the country that possesses the greatest area of forest is Russia.

In the 1970s, the countries with the largest forest area were: [[Soviet Union]] (approximately 8,800,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Brazil]] (5,150,000&amp;nbsp;km²), Canada (4,400,000&amp;nbsp;km²), United States (3,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Indonesia]] (1,200,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²). Other countries with important production and consumption of wood usually have a low [[density of population]] in relation to their territorial extension, here we can include countries as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], Sweden, [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 2001 the [[rainforest]] areas of Brazil were [[Deforestation in Brazil|reduced by a fifth]] (respect of 1970), to around 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²; the ground cleared was mainly destined for cattle [[pasture]]—Brazil is the world's largest exporter of [[beef]] with almost 200,000,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0625-amazon_beef.html|title=Brazil seizes cattle illegally grazing on Amazon forest lands|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booming Brazilian [[ethanol economy]] based upon [[sugar cane]] cultivation, is likewise reducing forests area. Canadian forest was reduced by almost 30% to 3,101,340&amp;nbsp;km² over the same period.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com/canadian_forests_quick_facts.htm|title=Canadian Forests - Quick Facts|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance in fighting greenhouse effect ===
Regarding the problem of climate change, it is known that burning forests increase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in atmosphere, while intact virgin forest or plantations act as sinks for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for these reasons wood economy fights [[greenhouse effect]]. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed depends on the type of trees, lands and the climate of the place where trees naturally grow or are planted. Moreover, by night plants do not [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]], and produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, eliminated the successive day. Paradoxically in summer [[oxygen]] created by photosynthesis in forests near to cities and urban parks, interacts with urban [[air pollution]] (from cars, etc.) and is transformed by solar beams in [[ozone]] (molecule of three oxygen atoms), that while in high atmosphere constitutes a filter against [[ultraviolet]] beams, in the low atmosphere is a pollutant, able to provoke respiratory disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome|title=Air quality levels in Europe — European Environment Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlunghealth.org/healthy_living/pollution/outdoor/effects|title=YourLungHealth.org - The Effects of Ozone Pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[low-carbon economy]], forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil based carbon reserves too much. Specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Per nation/continental area ==

=== In Australia ===
* [[Eucalyptus]]: these are seven hundred tree species from Australia, that grow very fast in tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid climates, and are very resistant to forest fires (with their tree cortex) and drought. Its [[essential oil]] is used in pharmacology, its wood for building, and the small branches as firewood and pulpwood.

=== In Brazil ===
[[Brazil]] has a long tradition in the harvesting of several types of trees with specific uses. Since the 1960s, imported species of pine tree and eucalyptus have been grown mostly for the [[plywood]] and [[pulp and paper industry|paper pulp industries]]. Currently high-level research is being conducted, to apply the enzymes of [[sugar cane]] fermentation to cellulose in wood, in order to obtain [[methanol]], but the cost is much higher when compared with ethanol derived from [[maize|corn]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8280/54|title=Brazzil Mag - Trying to understand Brazil since 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazilwood]]: has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high red shine (brasa=ember), and it is the premier wood used for making bows for string instruments from the [[violin]] family. These trees soon became the biggest source of [[red]] [[dye]], and they were such a large part of the economy and export of that country, that slowly it was known as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestryencyclopedia.jot.com/WikiHome/Harvesting%20Wood%20in%20Brazil|title=Harvesting wood in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hevea brasiliensis]]: is the biggest source of the best [[latex]], that is used to manufacture many objects in [[rubber]],  as an example [[gloves]], [[condom]]s, anti-allergic [[mattress]]es and [[tires]] (vulcanized rubber). Latex has the ability to adjust to the exact shape of the body part, an advantage over [[polyurethane]] or [[polyethylene]] gloves.

=== In Canada and the US ===
There is a close relation in the forestry economy between these countries; they have many tree genera in common, and Canada is the main producer of wood and wooden items destined to the US, the biggest consumer of wood and its byproducts in the world. The water systems of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Erie Canal]], [[Hudson River]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] to the east coast and the [[Mississippi River]] to the central plains and [[Louisiana]] allows transportation of logs at very low costs. On the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]], the basin of the [[Columbia River]] has plenty of forests with excellent timber.

==== Canada ====
The agency Canada Wood  Council calculates that in the year 2005 in Canada, the forest sector employed 930,000 workers (1 job in every 17), making around $108 billion of value in goods and services. For many years products derived from trees in Canadian forests had been the most important export items of the country. In 2011, exports around the world totaled some $64.3 billion – the single largest contributor to Canadian trade balance.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-works.org|title=Wood-Works - Program of the Canadian Wood Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the world leader in [[sustainable forest management]] practices. Only {{convert|120000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} (28% of Canadian forests) are currently managed for timber production while an estimated {{convert|32000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} are protected from harvesting by the current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com|title=Canadian Forests Website - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cherry]]: a [[hardwood]] prized for its high quality in grain, width, color, and rich warm glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greendesigns.com/index.html?about/cherry_wood|title=Classic American Furniture for the Home and Office from Green Design Furniture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trees were carried to the lands surrounding [[Rome]] ([[Latium]]) from [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Vegetable Kingdom -  Page 334&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, most cherry trees are grown in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], [[California]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=NASS&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/nass/PUBS/TODAYRPT/cher0608.txt Cherry Production] National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, Retrieved on August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cedrus|Cedar]]: this genus is a group of [[conifer]]s of the [[Pinaceae]] family, originating from high mountain areas from the [[Carpathians]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Himalayas]]. Their scented wood make them suitable for chests and closet lining. Cedar oil and wood is known to be a natural repellent to moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nodice/new/magazine/cedar/cedar.htm|title=Cedarwood Oils|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually are planted in western and southern US, mostly for ornamental purposes, but also for the production of [[pencil]]s (specially [[incense-cedar]]).
* [[Douglas fir]]: a native tree of the United States [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Mountain States|mountain states]], with records in fast growth and high statures in brief time. The [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] grows in coastal regions up to altitudes of about 1,800 meters; the [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]] grows farther inland, at altitudes ranging from 800 m to 3,000 m or higher. The wood is used for construction, for [[homebuilt aircraft]], for paper pulp, and also as [[firewood]].
* [[Hybrid poplar]] is being investigated by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/trees.html|title=Biofuels from Trees: Renewable Energy Research Branches Out|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5051|title=A National Assessment of Promising Areas for Switchgrass, Hybrid Poplar, or Willow Energy Crop Production|first1=R.

* [[Walnut]]: a prized furniture and carving hardwood because of its colour, hardness, grain and durability. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Caribbean and Central America ===
* [[Mahogany]]: has a straight grain, usually free of voids and pockets. The most prized species come from [[Cuba]] and [[Honduras]]. It has a reddish-brown color, which darkens over time, and displays a beautiful reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, is available in big boards, and is very durable. Mahogany is used in the making of many musical instruments, as [[drum]]s, acoustic and electric [[guitar]]s' back and side, and luxury [[headphone]]s.

=== In Europe ===

==== Italy ====
The species that are ideal for the many uses in this type of economy are those employed by [[arboriculture]], that are very well known for their features and the need for certain types of ground and climates.
* [[Fraxinus]]: being a lightweight wood is easy to transport, as firewood burns easily, grows in damp environments like those present in river flooding areas, stands pollution of water and air.
* [[Larix]]: in Italy it grows at high altitudes around mountain tops, its timber stand sudden climatic change, from icy winds to high temperatures in sunny afternoon summers, it is excellent for use in the building of exposed structures as bridges, roofs, etc.
* [[Stone pine]]: "Mediterranean pine" could be the noble emblem of many coastal areas in Italy, originally giant forests of pines extended from the mouth of the [[Tiber]] river until [[Liguria]] and [[Provence]] in France, over soils with high [[salinity]], not very apt for agriculture. Its trees produce a vast amount of dry branches that can be burnt, [[Pine cone|cones]] (used for Christmas decoration) and needle-like foliage that can be burnt, or used as [[mulch]]. Oils and resins can be used in [[scent]]s and [[ointments]]. The [[pinoli]] are useful elements in Italian cooking (along with [[basil]] are tritured to make [[pesto]] sauce). Currently, "progress" has brought to a severe reduction of this magnificent tree extensions, and in many places cheap beach buildings, car-parking and semi-abandoned areas have taken their place.
* [[Populus|Poplar]]: in Italy is the most important species for tree plantations, is used for several purposes as [[plywood]] manufacture, packing boxes, paper, [[match]]es, etc. It needs good quality grounds with good drainage, but can be used to protect the cultivations if disposed in [[windbreak]] lines. More than 70% of Italian poplar cultivations are located in the [[pianura Padana]]. Constantly the extension of the cultivation is being reduced, from 650&amp;nbsp;km² in the 1980s to current 350&amp;nbsp;km². The yield of poplars is about 1,500 t/km² of wood every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042,1043|title=Federlegno - Italian federation of wood producers and industry|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production from poplars is around 45–50% of the total Italian wood production.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte:http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[history of art]] poplar was the wood of choice for painting surfaces as panels, as in [[Renaissance]] (The [[Mona Lisa]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]). Because of this reason, many of the products with the highest [[added value]], extremely expensive, are made with wood from the humble but durable poplar.
** Because of the presence of [[tannic acid]], poplar cortex was often used in Europe for the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of [[leather]].

==== Portugal ====
* [[Cork oak|Oak]] for [[Cork (material)|cork]]: are trees with a slow growth, but long life, are cultivated in warm hill areas (min. temp. &gt; -5°Celsius) in all the west area of [[Mediterranean]] shores. Cork is popular as a material for [[bulletin board]]s. Even if the production as [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]]s for wine bottles is diminishing in favor of [[nylon]] stoppers, in the sake of energy saving granules of cork can be mixed into [[concrete]]. These composites have low thermal conductivity, low density and good energy absorption (earthquake resistant). Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³), compressive strength (1–26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;MPa).&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR. 2003. An Investigation of Cork Cement Composites. PhD Thesis. BCUC. Brunel University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this cork can be used as [[Thermal conductivity|thermal isolation]] in buildings (as well in its natural form and as a mixture), useful also as [[sound insulation]]. In the [[shoe]] industry cork is used for [[Shoe#Sole|sole]]s and [[insole]]s. In the world there are 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² of cork oak plantations, and every year are extracted around 300,000 tons of cork, 50% in [[Portugal]], 15,000 in Italy (12,000 in the island of [[Sardinia]]). The advantage of this natural industry is that the extraction of cork from layers outer to the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] does not kill the tree.

=== In Scandinavia and Russia ===
In Sweden, Finland and to an extent Norway, much of the land area is forested, the pulp and paper industry is one of the most significant industrial sectors. Chemical pulping produces an excess of energy, since the organic matter in [[black liquor]], mostly [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] breakdown products, is burned in the [[recovery boiler]]. Thus, these countries have high proportions of renewable energy use (25% in Finland, for instance). Considerable effort is directed towards increasing the value and usage of forest products by companies and by government projects.

* [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]]: These species comprise most of boreal forest, and together as a softwood mixture they are converted chemical pulp for paper.
* [[Birch]]: is a genus with many species of trees from [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, excellent for acid grounds. They act as [[pioneer species]] in the frozen border between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]], are very resistant to periods of [[drought]] and [[icy condition]]s. The species [[Betula nana]] has been identified as the ideal tree for the acid grounds of the sides of sloped mountains, also in southern Europe, with soils poor in nutrients, where these trees can be used to restrain [[landslide]]s. [[Dissolving pulp]] is produced from birch. [[Xylitol]] can be produced by hydrogenation of [[xylose]], which is a byproduct of chemical pulping of birch.

&lt;!--
Nessuna di queste specie sottrae terreni pregiati o particolarmente fertili all'agricoltura, ma, al contrario, contribuiscono a proteggere i suoli coltivati dall'erosione e dai venti. Nonostante questa caratteristica positiva in Italia, da secoli si assiste alla progressiva riduzione della presenza degli alberi nei terreni circostanti le colture con la conseguenza che l'eccesso di acqua meteorica non viene adeguatemente trattenuto e si possano verificare, quando succedono piogge abbondanti, catastrofiche [[alluvioni]].

== Uses of wood ==
{{Further information|Wood#Uses}}

== Combustion ==
{{main article|Wood fuel}}
The [[combustion|burning]] of wood is currently the largest use of [[energy]] derived from a [[solid fuel]] [[biomass]]. Wood fuel may be available as [[firewood]] (e.g. logs, bolts, blocks), [[charcoal]], chips, sheets, [[wood pellets|pellets]] and [[sawdust]]. Wood fuel can be used for [[cooking]] and [[heating]] through [[stove]]s and [[fireplace]]s, and occasionally for fueling [[steam engine]]s and steam [[turbines]] that [[electricity generation|generate electricity]]. For many centuries many types of traditional [[oven]]s were used in order to benefit from the heat generated by wood combustion. Now, more efficient and clean solutions have been developed: advanced [[fireplace]]s (with [[heat exchanger]]s), [[wood-fired oven]]s,  [[wood-burning stove]]s and [[pellet stove]]s, that are able to filter and separate pollutants (centrifuging [[wood ash|ash]]es with rotative filters), thus eliminating many emissions, also allowing to recover a higher quantity of heat that escaped with the [[chimney]] fumes.

Mean [[energy density]] of [[Wood]], was calculated at around 6–17 [[Megajoule]]/[[Kilogram]], depending on species and moisture content.

Combustion of wood is, however, linked to the production of micro-environmental pollutants, as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) (an invisible gas able to provoke irreversible saturation of [[blood]]'s [[hemoglobine]]), as well as [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olivares G, Ström J, Johansson C, Gidhagen L |title=Estimates of black carbon and size-resolved particle number emission factors from residential wood burning based on ambient monitoring and model simulations |journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=838–48 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18581814 |doi=10.3155/1047-3289.58.6.838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy [[Populus|poplar]] has been proposed as a tree cultivated to be transformed into [[biofuel]]s, because of the excellent ratio of energy extracted from its wood because of poplar's fast growing and capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the small amount of energy needed to cultivate, cut and transport the trees. ''Populus x canadensis'' 'I-214', grows so fast that is able to reach {{convert|14|in|cm}} in diameter and heights of {{convert|100|ft|m}} in ten years.

=== Charcoal ===
{{main article|Charcoal}}
Charcoal is the dark grey residue consisting of impure [[carbon]] obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from [[animal]] and [[vegetation]] substances.  Charcoal is usually produced by slow [[pyrolysis]], the heating of [[wood]] or other substances in the absence of [[oxygen]]. Charcoal can then be used as a fuel with a higher combustion temperature.

=== Wood gasogen ===
[[Wood gas generator]] (gasogen): is a bulky and heavy device (but technically simple) that transforms burning wood in a mix of molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). This gas mixture, known as "[[wood gas]]", "poor gas" or "[[syngas]]" is obtained after the [[combustion]] of dry wood in a [[redox|reductive environment]] (low in [[oxygen]]) with a limited amount of atmospheric air, at temperatures of 900° Celsius, and can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/bitstream/1957/1569/1/FPL_1463ocr.pdf Gasogens Report] (Original report dated 1944): now in the possession of the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|300px|A car built in the 1940s by [[Ilario Bandini]], with a wood gas generator device.]]

In the time between World War I and [[World War II]] included, because of the lack of [[oil]], in many countries, like Italy, France, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, several [[gasoline]]-powered cars were modified, with the addition of a [[wood gas generator]] (a "''gasogen''"), a device powered by wood, coal, or burnable waste, able to produce (and purify) gas that immediately, in the same vehicle, could power a slightly modified [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] [[engine]] of a standard car (low-compression engine). [[Carburetor]] had to be changed with an air-gas [[Mixer (engine)|mixer]]). There were several setbacks, as the great reduction of maximum speed and the need to drive using low [[gear]]s and wisely dosing the amount of air. In modern cars, modified with a wood gas generator, gas emissions (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NOx) are lower to those of the same vehicle running with gasoline (keeping the same [[catalytic converter]]).

===Methanol===
{{Main article|Methanol economy}}
[[Methanol]] (the simplest [[alcohol]]) behaves as a liquid at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, is toxic and  corrosive, and in [[organic chemistry]] basic books is often called "the spirit of wood", since it can be obtained from wood [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Rarely, when unwise [[wine]]-makers mix small chunks of wood and leaves with grapes, methanol can be found as a pollutant of the blend of water, [[ethanol]] and other substances derived from [[grape]]'s fermentation.

The best way to obtain methanol from wood is through [[syngas]] (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[anhydrous]] [[pyrolysis]] of wood, a method discovered by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.

Methanol can be used as an oxygen-rich additive for [[gasoline]]. However, it is usually much cheaper to produce methanol from [[methane]] or from syngas.  Methanol is the most important base material for industrial chemistry, where it is often used to make more complex molecules through reactions of [[halogenation]] and chemical [[addition reaction]].

===Gas turbine===

====Tanks====
The American [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] is powered by a [[gas turbine]] of {{convert|1500|hp|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |title=AGT1500 Turbine Technology on Honeywell.com |publisher= |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909103204/http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is able to function also with a mix at 50% of wood powder and [[biodiesel]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[kerosene]]. Its advantages over [[Turbocharger|turbo]]-[[diesel engine]], are the small size and light weight, the lack of a [[radiator]] (which gives an advantage against the effect of gun and cannon shots and missile strikes suffered in battle). A setback is the high fuel consumption, since the turbine engine has not the ability to work at a low revolutions per minute rate, much lower than ideal, and during the march this engine consumes twice as much fuel as a modern turbo-diesel engine with [[intercooler]] and [[Fuel injection|direct injection]].

==Construction==
{{main article|Lumber}}
Wood is relatively light in weight, because its [[specific weight]] is less than 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, this is an advantage,  when compared against 2,000-2,500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[armed concrete]] or 7,800&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[steel]].

Wood is strong, because the efficiency of wood for structural purposes has qualities that are similar to steel.

===Bridges, levees, microhydro, piers===
Wood is used to build bridges (as the [[Magere Brug|Magere bridge]] in [[Amsterdam]]), as well as water and air mills, and [[microhydro]] generators for electricity.

===Housing===
[[Hardwood]] is used as a material in [[lumber|wooden]] [[house]]s, and other structures with a broad range of dimensions. In traditional homes wood is preferred for [[ceiling]]s, [[door]]s, [[flooring]]s and [[window]]s. Wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame]]s were traditionally used for home ceilings, but they risk collapse during fires.

The development of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] houses including the "[[passive house]]" has revamped the importance of wood in construction, because wood provides acoustic and thermal [[Building insulation|insulation]], with much better results than concrete.

====Earthquake resistant buildings====
In Japan, ancient buildings, of relatively high elevation, like [[pagoda]]s, historically had shown to be able to resist [[earthquake]]s of high [[Seismic scale|intensity]], thanks to the traditional building techniques, employing elastic [[Kinematic pair|joint]]s, and to the excellent ability of wooden frames to elastically deform and absorb severe [[peak ground acceleration|acceleration]]s and [[compression (physical)|compressive]] shocks.

In 2006, Italian scientists from [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Terremoti-dal-Cnr-arriva-il.html|title=Girodivite: Terremoti: dal Cnr arriva il palazzo antisismico|first=|last=Girodivite.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a building system that they called "[[SOFIE]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progettosofie.it PROGETTOSOFIE: Edificio Antisismico in Legno]&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-[[storey]] wooden building, 24 meters high, built by the "Istituto per la valorizzazione del legno e delle specie arboree" (Ivalsa) of [[San Michele all'Adige]]. In 2007 it was tested with the hardest Japanese [[Earthquake engineering|antiseismic]] test for civil structures: the simulation of [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe's earthquake]] (7.2 [[Richter scale]]), with the building placed over an enormous oscillating platform belonging to the NIED-Institute, located in [[Tsukuba]] science park, near the city of [[Miki, Hyogo|Miki]] in Japan. This Italian project, employed very thin and flexible panels in [[glued laminated timber]], and according to CNR researchers could brought to the construction of much more safe houses in seismic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/04/cnr-progetto-casa-legno-anti-sisma.shtml?uuid=222999a2-241a-11de-bdf4-e9c9b14e9445&amp;DocRulesView=Libero|title=Dalla ricerca italiana la casa &amp;nbsp;di legno che resiste al terremoto - Il Sole 24 ORE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipbuilding ===
One of the most enduring materials is the lumber from [[virginia]]n [[Quercus virginiana|southern live oak]] and [[white oak]], specially live oak is 60% stronger than white oak and more resistant to moisture. As an example, the main component in the structure of battle ship [[USS Constitution]], the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat (launched in 1797) is white oak.&lt;ref name="Victory"&gt;{{cite web

== History of crisis in wood economies ==

===Classical Greece===
One of the most famous [[crisis]] of a wood-based economy is what happened in [[Classical Greece]], where trees began to disappear specially in the areas of [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Peloponnesus]] where indiscriminate cutting of trees for several uses, associated to drought and [[wildfire]]s led to a severe lack of timber in order to build lances, shields, ships, etc. and to a slow but progressive weakening in military and naval power of the peninsular kingdoms in Greece, that were overwhelmed by [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and by the [[Kingdom of Macedon]], much more fertile lands because of their rainy winters. This process arrived to the apex with the conquest of Greece by [[Phillip II of Macedon]].

The secret weapon of the [[Sarissaphoros]] soldiers (supported by [[peltast]] javelineers), commanded by Philipp II in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]] and in those that followed fought by [[Alexander the Great]] (which brought to the conquest of [[Lesser Asia]], [[Babylon]], [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]]), was the [[sarissa]], a type of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]], longer and stronger (5–7 m.) than the other Greek [[lance]]s, obtained from the heavy and strong [[European Cornel|cornel wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardeavalpometto.org/parco_boschi.html|title=Parco Naturale Valpometto - I boschi di casa nostra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapa Nui===
{{Dispute|date=July 2017}}
[[History of Easter Island#Pre-European society|Rapa Nui]], best known as "Easter Island", is a typical example of [[malthusianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27864/1/WP117.pdf|title=Why Easter Island Collapsed: An Answer for an Enduring Question|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically how the [[exponential growth]] of a populace leads to the end of a [[renewable resource]]. At a certain point, the compelling societal need forces exploitation of the resource above and beyond the resource's natural rate of renewal.

It has been calculated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/eterms/qt/easter_island.htm|title=What Has Science Learned about the People Who Settled Easter Island?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that after the year 1000, around 10 million [[palmtree]]s were cut in Rapa Nui, resulting in the [[erosion]] of the fertile land, and eventually to a [[desertification]] around the 15th century. (This deforestation may have also been aggravated and/or caused by a rat [[infestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-12-05-easter-island_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Did Easter Island get 'ratted' out?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This provoked a population reduction from 15,000 to 2,500 individuals. Without palmtree wood, no boats, or lances could be constructed. Without palm fibers, construction of ropes and fishing nets halted.  This led to a decrease in the local fish harvest, which in turn led to a decrease in the quantity of dietary protein available to the island's inhabitants.  At the end, the society became an easy prey for [[hunger]] and [[civil war]].  From 1600 to 1700, the people became superstitious in a fanatical way. In the last moments, there was a disintegration of [[society]] and total chaos. The destruction of the traditional symbols followed, leading to the eventual extinction of the [[Moai]]s [[civilization]] and [[culture]], even if there was not any external human enemy.

Green shaded area is net work, blue shaded area is work lost to passive and active resistance, and green + blue is total work.]]
The '''work loop''' technique is used in muscle physiology to evaluate the mechanical [[Work (physics)|work]] and [[Power (physics)|power]] output of [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal]] or [[Cardiac muscle|cardiac]] muscle contractions via [[In vitro muscle testing|''in vitro'' muscle testing]] of whole muscles, fiber bundles or single muscle fibers.  This technique is primarily used for cyclical contractions such as the rhythmic flapping of [[Bird flight|bird wings]]&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/21/3587.full&lt;/ref&gt; or the beating of heart [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] muscle.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/19/2723.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To simulate the rhythmic shortening and lengthening of a muscle (e.g. while moving a limb), a [[servo motor]] oscillates the muscle at a given frequency and range of motion observed in natural behavior.  Simultaneously, a burst of electrical pulses is applied to the muscle at the beginning of each shortening-lengthening cycle to stimulate the muscle to produce force.  Since force and length return to their initial values at the end of each cycle, a plot of force vs. length yields a 'work loop'.  Intuitively, the area enclosed by the loop represents the net mechanical work performed by the muscle during a single cycle.

[[File:Work loop animation v3.gif|thumb|Animation of a hypothetical work loop. Note the counter-clockwise motion of the loop, indicating net work generation by the muscle (as opposed to net work absorption)]]

[[File:Workloop series v1.png|thumb|''In vitro'' force-length cycles. Each cycle (e.g. gray box) begins with electrical pulses to stimulate force production. While measuring force output, the experimenter controls stimulation and length input to match ''in vivo'' rhythmic motions and neural activation.]]

==History==
Classical studies from the 1920s through the 1960s characterized the fundamental properties of muscle activation (via [[action potential]]s from [[motor neuron]]s), [[Sliding filament model|force development]], length change and shortening velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, A. V. (1970). First and last experiments in muscle mechanics. London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, each of these parameters were measured while holding other ones constant, making their interactions unclear.  For instance, [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force-velocity and force-length]] relationships were determined at constant velocities and loads.  Yet during locomotion, neither muscle velocity nor muscle force are constant.  In running, for example, muscles in each leg experience time-varying forces ''and'' time-varying shortening velocities as the leg decelerates and accelerates from [[Gait (human)#Foot strike|heelstrike to toeoff]].  In such cases, classical force-length (constant velocity) or force-velocity (constant length) experiments might not be sufficient to fully explain muscle function.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/23/3377.short&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the work loop method was introduced to explore muscle contractions of both variable speed and variable force.  These early work loop experiments characterized the mechanical behavior of [[asynchronous muscle]] (a type of [[Insect physiology#Muscular system|insect flight muscle]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/152/948/311&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to the specialized nature of asynchronous muscle, the work loop method was only applicable for [[Insect physiology#Muscular system|insect muscle]] experiments.  In 1985, [[Robert K. Josephson]] modernized the technique to evaluate properties of [[Synchronous muscle|synchronous]] muscles powering [[Tettigoniidae|katydid]] flight&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/1/493&lt;/ref&gt; by stimulating the muscle at regular time intervals during each shortening-lengthening cycle.  Josephson's innovation generalized the work loop technique for wide use among both [[invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]] muscle types, profoundly advancing the fields of muscle physiology and [[Biomechanics#Comparative Biomechanics|comparative biomechanics]].

Work loop experiments also allowed greater appreciation for the role of activation &amp; relaxing kinetics in muscle power and work output. For instance, if a muscle turns on and off more slowly, the shortening and lengthening curves will be shallower and closer together, resulting in decreased work output.  "Negative" work loops were also discovered, showing that muscle lengthening at higher force than the shortening curve can result in net energy absorption by the muscle, as in the case of deceleration or constant-speed downhill walking.

In 1992, the work loop approach was extended further by the novel use of bone strain measurements to obtain ''in vivo'' force.  Combined either with estimates of muscle length changes or with direct methods (e.g. [[sonomicrometry]]), ''in vivo'' force technology enabled the first ''in vivo'' work loop measurements.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/164/1/1.abstract?sid=106f650c-81c1-4d4e-9cac-4e10039f7131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work loop analysis==

===Positive, negative and net work===
A work loop combines two separate plots: force vs. time and length vs. time.  When force is plotted against length, a work loop plot is created: each point along the loop corresponds to a force and a length value at a unique point in time.  As time progresses, the plotted points trace the shape of the work loop.  The direction in which the work loop is traced through time is a critical feature of the work loop.  As the muscle shortens while generating a tensile force (i.e. "pulling"), then, by convention in, the muscle is said to be performing positive work during that phase. As the muscle lengthens (while still generating a tensile force), the muscle is performing negative work (or, alternatively, that positive work is being performed '' on'' the muscle). Thus a muscle generating force while shortening is said to output 'positive work' (i.e. generating work), whereas a muscle generating force while lengthening produces 'negative work' (i.e. absorbing work). Over an entire cycle, there is typically some positive, and some negative work; if the overall cycle is counter-clockwise vs. clockwise work loop represents overall work generation vs. work absorption, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Biewener, A. (2003). Animal Locomotion. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example during a jump, the leg muscles generate work to increase the body's speed away from the ground, yielding counter-clockwise work loops.  When landing, however, the same muscles absorb work to decrease the body's speed, yielding clockwise work loops.  Furthermore, a muscle can produce positive work followed by negative work (or vice versa) within a shortening-lengthening cycle, causing a 'figure 8' work loop shape containing both clockwise and counter-clockwise segments.&lt;ref&gt;http://jp.physoc.org/content/549/3/877.short&lt;/ref&gt;

Since work is defined as force multiplied by displacement, the area of the graph shows the mechanical work output of the muscle.  In a typical work-generating instance, the muscle shows a rapid curvilinear rise in force as it shortens, followed by a slower decline during or shortly before the muscle begins the lengthening phase of the cycle.  The area beneath the shortening curve (upper curve) gives the total work done by the shortening muscle, while the area beneath the lengthening curve (lower curve) represents the work absorbed by the muscle and turned into heat (done by either environmental forces or antagonistic muscles).  Subtracting the latter from the former gives the net mechanical work output of the muscle cycle, and dividing that by the cycle duration gives net mechanical power output.&lt;ref&gt;Biewener, A. (2003). Animal Locomotion. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inferring muscle function from work loop shape===
Hypothetically, a square work loop (area = max force x max displacement) would represent the maximum work output of a muscle operating within a given force and length range.&lt;ref&gt;Biewener, A. (2003). Animal Locomotion. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/8/1363&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, a flat line (area = 0) would represent the minimum work output. For example, a muscle that generates force without changing length ([[Muscle contraction#Isometric contraction|isometric contraction]]) will show a vertical line 'work loop'. Reciprocally, a muscle that shortens without changing force ([[Muscle contraction#Isomtonic contraction|isotonic contraction]]) will show a horizontal line 'work loop'.  Finally, a muscle can behave like a [[Spring (device)|spring]] which extends linearly as a force is applied.  This final case would yield a slanted straight line 'work loop' where the line [[slope]] is the spring [[stiffness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, S. A. (1982). Mechanical design in organisms: Princeton Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work loop experimental approach==
Work loop experiments are most often performed on muscle tissue isolated either from invertebrates (e.g. [[insect]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/1/493&lt;/ref&gt; and [[crustacean]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/145/1/45&lt;/ref&gt;) or small vertebrates (e.g. [[fish]],&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/151/1/453.abstract?sid=b67053d6-9126-41c8-afb4-bc797b62a4bc&lt;/ref&gt; [[frogs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://jp.physoc.org/content/549/3/877&lt;/ref&gt; [[rodent]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/content/200/24/3119.abstract?sid=b6d72d95-cd9d-4378-9294-02f9973ad04a&lt;/ref&gt;).  The experimental technique described below applies both to ''[[In vitro muscle testing|in vitro]]'' and ''[[In vitro muscle testing#In situ|in situ]]'' approaches.

===Experimental setup===
Following humane procedures approved by [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|IACUC]], the muscle is isolated from the animal (or prepared in situ), attached to the [[In vitro muscle testing apparatus|muscle testing apparatus]] and bathed in oxygenated [[Ringer's solution]] or [[Krebs-Henseleit solution]] maintained at a constant temperature. While the isolated muscle is still living, the experimenter then applies two manipulations to test muscle function: 1) Electrical stimulation to mimic the action of a motor neuron and 2) strain (muscle length change) to mimic the rhythmic motion of a limb.  To elicit muscle contraction, the muscle is stimulated by a series of electrical pulses delivered by an [[electrode]] to stimulate either the motor nerve or the muscle tissue itself.  Simultaneously, a computer-controlled servo motor in the testing apparatus oscillates the muscle while measuring the force generated by the stimulated muscle.  The following parameters are modulated by the experimenter to influence muscle force, work and power output:

*Stimulation duration: The time period over which the muscle receives electrical stimulation
*Stimulation pulse frequency: The number of stimulation pulses per stimulation duration
*Stimulation phase: The time delay between the onset of stimulation and muscle length change
*Strain amplitude: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the length oscillation pattern
*Strain/cycle frequency: The number of shortening-lengthening periods per time period

[[File:PhaseChange workloop animation v1.gif|thumb|300px|Stimulation phase influences mechanical work output. Work generation vs. work absorption are shown by red vs. blue shading, respectively. Note how stimulation phase influences both the shape and magnitude of force as well as the direction of the work loop.&lt;ref&gt;http://jp.physoc.org/content/549/3/877.short&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Calculating muscular work and power from experimental data===
Calculation of either muscle work or power requires collection of muscle force and length (or velocity) data at a known sampling rate. Net work is typically calculated either from instantaneous power (muscle force x muscle velocity) or from the area enclosed by the work loop on a force vs. length plot. Both methods are mathematically equivalent and highly accurate, however the 'area inside the loop' method (despite its simplicity) can be tedious to carry out for large data sets.

====Method 1: Instantaneous power method====
Step 1) Obtain muscle velocity by [[numerical differentiation]] of muscle length data.
Step 2) Obtain instantaneous muscle power by multiplying muscle force data by muscle velocity data for each time sample.
Step 3) Obtain net work (a single number) by [[numerical integration]] of muscle power data.
Step 4) Obtain net power (a single number) by dividing net work by the time duration of the cycle.

====Method 2: Area inside the loop method====
The area inside the work loop can be quantified either 1) digitally by importing a work loop image into [[ImageJ]], tracing the work loop shape and quantifying its area. Or, 2) manually by printing a hard copy of the work loop graph, cutting the inner area and weighing it on an [[Weighing scale#Analytical balance|analytical balance]]. Net work is then divided by the time duration of the cycle to obtain net power.

==Applications to skeletal muscle physiology==
A significant advantage of the work loop technique over assessments of skeletal muscle power in humans is that confounding factors associated with skeletal muscle function masks true power production at the skeletal muscle level. The most notable confounding factors include the influence of the [[central nervous system]] limiting the ability to generate maximal power output, examinations of whole muscle groups rather than individual skeletal muscles, bodily [[inertia]], and motivational aspects associated with sustained muscle activity. Additionally, measures of muscle fatigue are not affected by [[Central nervous system fatigue|fatigue]] of the central nervous system. By adopting the work loop technique in an isolated muscle model, these confounding factors are eliminated, thus allowing for a closer examination of the muscle-specific changes in work loop power output in response to a stimulus. Moreover, usage of the work loop technique as opposed to other modes of contraction, such as [[Muscle contraction|isometric]], [[Muscle contraction|isotonic]] and [[Muscle contraction|isovelocity]], allows for a better representation of the changes in mechanical work of the skeletal muscle in response to an independent variable, such as the direct application of [[caffeine]],&lt;ref&gt;https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14765381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00801.2011| pmid=21979804|title = The effect of physiological concentrations of caffeine on the power output of maximally and submaximally stimulated mouse EDL (fast) and soleus (slow) muscle| journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=112| issue=1| pages=64–71|year = 2012|last1 = Tallis|first1 = Jason| last2=James| first2=Rob S.| last3=Cox| first3=Val M.| last4=Duncan| first4=Michael J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s12603-016-0832-9| pmid=28346571|title = Is the ergogenicity of caffeine affected by increasing age?

==Applications to animal locomotion==

===Identifying muscle functional roles: motors, brakes, springs, or struts===
As a “motor” the [[muscle]] does work on the environment resulting in positive [[Work (physics)|work]] in the work loop in the counter-clockwise direction. When positive work happens the length of the muscle will increase followed by an increase in force before reaching a peak. When the peak is reached the muscle will shorten along with a decrease in force.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Biewener, W. R. Corning, B. T. Tobalske, J. Exp.Biol. 201, 3293 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; An example of positive work being done in the environment would be scallops swimming.&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Dickinson, Claire T. Farley, Robert J. Full, M. A. R. Koehl, Rodger Kram, and Steven Lehman.Science 7 April 2000: 288 (5463), 100-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a “brake” the muscle is able to absorb energy from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Full, D. R. Stokes, A. N. Ahn, R. K. Josephson, J.Exp. Biol. 201, 997 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; This then results in negative work in the work loop in a clockwise direction. The result is a shortening of the muscles as well as a decrease in force output. After the muscle is done absorbing the energy from the environment, the length of the muscle then returns to normal with increased force. In [[cockroaches]], there are legs that act purely as “brakes” to stop the animal’s movement.

As a “spring” the muscles are able to alter between states of motion, thus producing negative work &lt;ref&gt;M. S. Tu and M. H. Dickinson, J. Exp. Biol. 192, 207(1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Dickinson and M. S. Tu, Comp. Biochem.Physiol. A 116, 223 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; this negative work results from the movement and changing of the muscles position in [[bird flight]] and [[human]] legs in order to produce more energy. The “springs” in these muscles absorb the energy from the environment and redirect it, then outputting that absorbed energy to make repeated movements more energy efficient.

As a “strut” the muscle can output a force and then hold the muscle length. In [[fish]] movement the body moves back and forth to produce work but as the fish moves the muscles move the energy down the length of the fish. As the energy passes the muscle the muscle then holds as a “strut”. The length of the muscle as a “strut” remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Shadwick, J. F. Steffenson, S. L. Katz, T. Knower, Am. Zool. 38, 755 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asymmetrical muscle length trajectories===
Originally, workloops imposed a sinusoidal length change on the muscle, with equal time lengthening and shortening. However, in vivo muscle length change often has greater than half the cycle shortening, and less than half lengthening.  Imposing these "asymmetrical" stretch-shorten cycles can result in higher work and power outputs, as shown in treefrog calling muscles.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/202/22/3225&lt;/ref&gt;
