'''Advanced Placement Computer Science A''' (also called '''AP Comp Sci''', '''AP Comp Sci A''', '''APCS''', or '''AP Java''') is an [[AP Computer Science]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] to [[high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for a [[college]]-level [[computer science]] course. '''AP Computer Science A'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/4483.html AP Computer Science A Home Page], The College Board&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. The AP exam currently tests students on their knowledge of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

AP Computer Science AB, which was equivalent to a full year, was discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration.&lt;ref name=CSABdiscontinued&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | title = Important Announcement about AP Computer Science AB | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195847/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | archive-date = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course content==
AP Computer Science emphasizes [[object-oriented programming]] methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and [[algorithm]] development. It also includes the study of data structures and abstraction, but these topics were not covered to the extent that they were covered in AP Computer Science AB. The [[Microsoft]]-sponsored program [[Technology Education and Literacy in Schools]] (TEALS) aims to increase the number of students taking AP Computer Science classes.&lt;ref name="Bishop2012-07-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=2012-07-27 |title=Geek of the Week: Kevin Wang is putting computer scientists into high schools |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |newspaper=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=2015-07-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zo1zm7iP?url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies and labs==
Historically, the AP exam used several programs in its free-response section to test students' knowledge of object-oriented programs without requiring them to develop an entire environment. These programs were called Case Studies.

This practice was discontinued as of the 2014-15 school year and replaced with optional labs that teach concepts.

===Case studies (discontinued)===
Case studies were used in AP Computer Science curriculum starting in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226050416/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/compsci_a/case.html?compscia | archive-date = February 26, 2012 | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/compsci_a/case.html?compscia | title = GridWorld Case Study | work = AP | publisher = The College Board }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Big Integer case study (1994-2000)====
The Big Integer case study was in use prior to 2000. It was replaced by the Marine Biology case study.

====Marine Biology case study (2000-2007)====
The Marine Biology Case Study (MBCS) was a program written in [[C++]] until 2003, then in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], for use with the A and AB examinations. It served as an example of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) embedded in a more complicated design project than most students had worked with before.
 
The case study was designed to allow the [[College Board]] to quickly test a student's knowledge of [[object oriented programming]] ideas such as [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] and [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]] while requiring students to understand how objects such as "the environment", "the fish", and the simulation's control module interact with each other without having to develop the entire environment independently, which would be quite time consuming. The case study also gives all students taking the AP Computer Science exams with a common experience from which to draw additional test questions.
 
On each of the exams, at least one free-response question was derived from the case study. There were also five multiple-choice questions that are derived from the case study.
 
This case study was discontinued from 2007, and was replaced by [[GridWorld]].

====GridWorld case study (2008-2014)====
'''GridWorld''' is a computer program case study written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that was used with the [[AP Computer Science]] program from 2008 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Horstmann, Cay. [http://gridworld.info/ "GridWorld".] ''horstmann.com''. Accessed September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as an example of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). GridWorld succeeded the [[Advanced Placement Computer Science#Marine Biology Case Study|Marine Biology Simulation Case Study]], which was used from 2000–2007. The GridWorld framework was designed and implemented by [http://horstmann.com Cay Horstmann], based on the Marine Biology Simulation Case Study. The narrative was produced by Chris Nevison and Barbara Cloud Wells, [[Colgate University]].

The [[GridWorld]] Case Study was used as a substitute for writing a single large program as a culminating project. Due to obvious time restraints during the exam, the GridWorld Case Study was provided by the College Board &lt;!-- commented out direct link just in case it can be used as a reference in the future [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/GridWorldCode.zip]--&gt; to students prior to the exam. Students were expected to be familiar with the classes and interfaces (and how they interact) before taking the exam. The case study was divided into five sections, the last of which was only tested on the AB exam. Roughly five multiple-choice questions in Section I were devoted to the GridWorld Case Study, and it was the topic of one free response question in Section II.

GridWorld has been discontinued and replaced with a set of labs for the 2014-2015 school year.

*'''Actors'''
**The GridWorld Case Study employs an Actor class to construct objects in the grid.  The Actor class manages the object's color, direction, location, what the object does in the simulation, and how the object interacts with other objects.
**Actors are broken down into the classes "Flower", "Rock", "Bug", and "Critter", which inherit the Actor class and often override certain methods (most notably the Act method).  Flowers can't move, and when forced to Act, they become darker.  Flowers are dropped by Bugs and eaten by Critters.  Rocks are also immobile and aren't dropped or eaten.  Bugs move directly ahead of themselves, unless blocked by a rock or another bug, in which case the Bug will make a 45 degree turn and try again.  They drop flowers in every space they occupy, eat flowers that are directly on their space of grid, and are consumed by Critters.  Critters move in a random direction to a space that isn't occupied by a Rock or other Critter and consume Flowers and Bugs.
*'''Extensions'''
**The Case Study also includes several extensions of the above classes. "BoxBug" extends "Bug" and moves in a box shape if its route is not blocked. "ChameleonCritter" extends "Critter" and does not eat other Actors, instead changing its color to match the color one of its neighbors. "Crab Critter" moves left or right and only eats Actors in front of it, but otherwise extends the "Critter" class.
**Students often create their own extensions of the Actor class. Some common examples of student created extensions are [[Four Lords of the Diamond|Warden organisms]] and SimCity-like structures, in which objects of certain types create objects of other types based on their neighbors (much like [[Conway's Game of Life]]). Students have even created versions of the games [[Pac-Man]], [[Fire Emblem]], and [[Tetris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horstmann|first1=Cay|title=Extending GridWorld|url=http://www.horstmann.com/gridworld/extending-gridworld.html|website=Extending GridWorld|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Known issues'''
**The version that is available at the College Board website, GridWorld 1.00, contains a bug (not to be confused with the Actor subclass Bug) that causes a SecurityException to be thrown when it is deployed as an [[Java applet|applet]]. This was fixed in the "unofficial code" release on the GridWorld website. Also, after setting the environment to an invalid BoundedGrid, it will cause a [[Null pointer|NullPointerException]].

===Labs===
Instead of the discontinued case studies, the College Board created three new labs that instructors are invited to use, but they are optional and are not tested on the exam. There are no question on the specific content of the labs on the AP exam, but there are questions that test the concepts developed in the labs. The three labs are:&lt;ref name="labreq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/221994.html | title=New Computer Science A Lab Requirement | accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Magpie Lab
* The Elevens Lab
* The Picture Lab

==AP test==
===History===
The AP exam in Computer Science was first offered in 1984.

Before 1999, the AP exam tested students on their knowledge of [[Pascal Programming Language|Pascal]]. From 1999 to 2003, the exam tested students on their knowledge of [[C++]] instead. Since 2003, the AP Computer Science exam has tested students on their knowledge of computer science through [[Java (Sun)|Java]].

===Format===
The exam is composed of two sections, formerly consisting of the following times:

*Section I: Multiple Choice [1 hour and 15 minutes for 40 multiple-choice questions]
*Section II: Free-Response [1 hour and 45 minutes for 4 problems involving extended reasoning]

As of 2015, however, the Multiple Choice section was extended by 15 minutes while the Free-Response section was reduced by 15 minutes for the following:

*Section I: Multiple Choice [1 hour and 30 minutes for 40 multiple-choice questions]
*Section II: Free-Response [1 hour and 30 minutes for 4 problems involving extended reasoning]

===Grade distributions for AP Computer Science===
In the 2014 administration, 39,278 students took the exam. The mean score was a 2.96 with a standard deviation of 1.55. The grade distributions since 2003 were:

==AP Computer Science AB ==
===Course content===
The discontinued '''AP Computer Science AB''' course included all the topics of AP Computer Science A, as well as a more formal and a more in-depth study of [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], and [[data abstraction]]. For example, [[binary trees]] were studied in AP Computer Science AB but not in AP Computer Science A. The use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] data structures and [[dynamic allocation|dynamically allocated]] structures were fundamental to AP Computer Science AB. Due to low numbers of students taking the AP Computer Science AB exam, it was discontinued after the 2008–2009 year.&lt;ref&gt;Cech, Scott J., [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/04/09/32ap.h27.html "College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects"], Education Week, 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acute toxicity''' describes the adverse effects of a substance that result either from a single exposure&lt;ref name="msds"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/acutetoxicity.html|title=The MSDS HyperGlossary: Acute toxicity|accessdate = 2006-11-15|publisher=Safety Emporium| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061016141309/http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/acutetoxicity.html| archivedate= 16 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from multiple exposures in a short period of time (usually less than 24&amp;nbsp;hours).&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=acute toxicity|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/AT06800.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be described as ''acute'' toxicity, the adverse effects should occur within 14&amp;nbsp;days of the administration of the substance.&lt;ref name="IUPAC"/&gt;

Acute toxicity is distinguished from [[chronic toxicity]], which describes the adverse health effects from repeated exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer time period (months or years).

It is widely considered unethical to use humans as '''test''' subjects for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be gained from investigating accidental human exposures (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from [[animal testing]] or, more recently, ''[[in vitro]]'' testing methods and [[Statistical inference|inference]] from data on similar substances.&lt;ref name="msds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walum E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=106 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=497–503 |year=1998 |pmid=9599698 |doi=10.2307/3433801 |pmc=1533392 |jstor=3433801 |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measures of acute toxicity ==

=== Regulatory values ===
Limits for short-term exposure, such as STELs or CVs, are defined only if there is a particular acute toxicity associated with a substance. These limits are set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), based on experimental data. The values set by these organizations do not always coincide exactly, and in the chemical industry it is general practice to choose the most conservative value in order to ensure the safety of employees. The values can typically be found in a [[material safety data sheet]]. There are also different values based on the method of entry of the compound (oral, dermal, or inhalation).
*[[Threshold limit value-time-weighted-average]]: The maximum concentration to which a worker can be exposed every work day (8 hours) and experience no adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="Chemical Process Safety" /&gt;
*[[Short-Term Exposure Limit]], STEL or [[Threshold limit value-short-term exposure limit]], TLV-STEL: The concentration which no person should be exposed to for more than 15 minutes during an 8-hour work day.&lt;ref name="Chemical Process Safety"&gt;D.A. Crowl and J.F. Louvar, Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals with 
Applications, Third Edition, Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ceiling value]], CV or [[Threshold limit value-ceiling]], TLV-C: The concentration which no person should ever be exposed to.&lt;ref name="Chemical Process Safety" /&gt;

=== Experimental values ===
*[[No-observed-adverse-effect level]], NOAEL
*[[Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level]], LOAEL
*[[Maximum tolerable concentration]], MTC, LC&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Maximum tolerable dose]], MTD, LD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Minimum lethal concentration]], LC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Minimum lethal dose]], LD&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Median lethal concentration]], LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Median lethal dose]], LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Median lethal time]], [[LT50|LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[LT50]])
*[[Absolute lethal concentration]], LC&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;; [[Absolute lethal dose]], LD&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;

The most referenced value in the chemical industry is the median lethal dose, or LD50. This is the concentration of substance which resulted in the death of 50% of test subjects (typically mice or rats) in the laboratory.

==Responses and treatments==
When a person has been exposed to an acutely toxic dose of a substance, they can be treated in a number of ways in order to minimize the harmful effects. Obviously, the severity of the response is related to the severity of the toxic response exhibited. These treatment methods include (but are not limited to):
*[[Shower#Other types of showers|Emergency showers]] used for removing irritating or hazardous chemicals from the skin.
*[[Eyewash|Emergency eye washes]] used for removing any irritating or hazardous chemicals from the eyes.
*[[Activated carbon#medical applications|Activated charcoal]] used to bind and remove harmful substances consumed orally. This is used as an alternative to conventional [[Gastric lavage|stomach pumping]].

[[Metal]]s used for [[Architecture|architectural]] purposes include [[lead (metal)|lead]], for [[water pipes]], [[roofing material|roofing]], and windows; [[tin]], formed into [[tinplate]]; [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[aluminium]], in a range of applications including roofing and decoration; and [[iron]], which has structural and other uses in the form of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]], or made into [[steel]]. Metal [[alloy]]s used in building include [[bronze]] (mainly copper and tin); [[brass]] (copper and zinc); [[monel metal]] and [[nickel silver]], mainly consisting of nickel and copper; and [[stainless steel]], with important components of nickel and [[chromium]].

== Metal types ==

=== Lead ===
The low [[melting point]] of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history. [[Water pipes]] were frequently constructed of lead, until its health hazards were publicised in the late 19th century.

Lead has been a popular [[roofing material]] for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the [[mid-Atlantic states]], experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “[[terne]]” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin [[alloy]]. It is frequently confused with [[tinplate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead [[came]] was also frequently used for window panes in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. [[Lead-based paint]] was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of [[lead poisoning]].

=== Tin ===
The principal architectural uses of [[tin]] fall into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as [[copper]] to form [[bronze]], and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.

[[Tinplate]] was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron coated with tin. “Tin roofs,” a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows, door lintels. Although tinplate is still available today for roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as [[asphalt]] shingles or built-up roofs. A well-maintained tinplate roof typically lasts several times longer than either of these types of roofing, and is more economical when the longer lifespan is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zinc ===
Pure [[zinc]] was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures.

Zinc-coated metals were first [[patented]] in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany and Austria as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals.

[[Zinc oxide]] paints were nontoxic and resistant to [[pollution]]. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good rust inhibitors on iron and steel.

During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Layne|title=Architectural Zinc: From Gray to Green|url=http://construction.com/CE/articles/0712rheinzink-2.asp|website=construction.com|publisher=McGraw Hill Construction|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final [[patina]].  Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey.  Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process.  Zinc is still used in alloys such as [[brass]] and [[nickel silver]], and in the [[electroplating]] of steel as well. Today, [[galvanized steel]] and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of [[titanium]] in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common.

Architectural grade zinc is 90 to 95% recycled.  Replacement costs are negligible with a long lifetime of 80 to 100 years for zinc roofing and 200 to 300 years for wall systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc|url=http://www.metaltech-usa.com/zinc.html|website=www.metaltech-usa.com|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This long-life durability is a key component in durability.  At the end of its service life, zinc building products can be recycled indefinitely without loss to chemical or physical properties.  The use of architectural grade zinc can help building qualify for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification due to its high recycled content and sustainability.

=== Copper and its alloys ===
{{Main article|Copper in architecture}}

[[Copper]] is a very durable metal, withstanding [[corrosion]] when forming a bluish-green [[patina]] that variably consists of copper [[carbonates]], [[sulfates]], [[sulfides]], and [[chloride]]s. Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate, tile, or lead. Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams, or shaped over curved frameworks for [[cupolas]] and domes.

The initial cost of copper was traditionally high, but its length of service more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 22-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper was also used for decorative purposes, including architectural ornaments or sculptures. One famous example is the [[Statue of Liberty]].

Copper alloys used in architecture include [[bronze]], an alloy of copper and tin, and [[brass]], an alloy of copper and zinc.

=== Nickel and its alloys ===
Although somewhat rare, [[nickel]] has been used for plating architectural details. Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys: [[nickel silver]], [[Monel metal]], and [[stainless steel]].

Nickel silver was originally called “German Silver,” until World War I. It has been called “white brass” but probably should be termed “nickel brass,” because it generally contains 75% copper, 20% nickel, and 5% zinc. Different percentages result in a range of colors, including silvery-white, yellow, slight blue, green or pink. Nickel silver hardware was popular in the US during the [[Art Deco]] and Depression Modern periods. Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes, and it resisted corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It is similar to platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the [[New York City Public Library]] at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 35-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron and its alloys ===
Iron has become an important architectural building component. It has been used in four common forms: wrought iron, cast iron, sheet iron, and steel.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 42-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wrought iron]] was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.

[[Cast iron]] was a major 19th century building material of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included stairs, elevators, lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The [[Bradbury Building]] is an example of extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices.

Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century, although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a “tin ceiling,” although tin was generally not used indoors.

[[Steel]] was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the [[Bessemer process]] was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of [[terra-cotta]], tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed [[Building insulation|insulation]]. Ferro concrete, also called [[reinforced concrete]], was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.

Decorative steels used in buildings include:
* [[Stainless steel]], a chromium-nickel steel, developed between 1903 and 1912. Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion. It contains about 18% chromium and 8-12% nickel. Stainless steel is expensive, so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion. One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the [[Chrysler Building]].
* Copper-bearing steels, containing from .15% to .25% copper, develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. [[Eero Saarinen]] experimented with the material in the [[Deere and Company]] building in 1964.

=== Aluminium ===
Much like copper, [[Aluminium]] is highly resistant to [[corrosion]]. It also has the added benefit of being a third lighter than steel with comparable strength. Aluminium can also be easily and repeatedly recycled. It has been estimated that of the estimated 900 million tonnes of aluminium produced since 1880, three quarters is still in productive use, 35% of which is in building construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://recycling.world-aluminium.org/review/global-metal-flow.html|title = Global Metal Flow|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-15|website = Aluminium for Future Generations|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminum|Aluminium]] was unavailable at reasonable cost or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels. Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features. The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the [[Empire State Building]], where the entire tower portion is aluminum, as well as many decorative features, such as the entrances, elevator doors, ornamental trim, and some 6,000 window [[spandrels]]. Today, aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle &amp; Waite (1980), pp 84-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barro Colorado Island''' (BCI) is located in the man-made [[Gatun Lake]] in the middle of the [[Panama Canal]]. The [[island]] was formed when the waters of the [[Chagres River]] were dammed to form the lake in 1913.  When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing [[tropical forest]], but certain hilltops remained as islands in the middle of the lake. It has an area of {{convert|15.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Croat1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B.

Many scientific studies have been conducted to document the changes in the species composition of the island.

Hundreds of scientists conduct research projects on Barro Colorado Island every year.&lt;ref name=newsci/&gt;

[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] produced a documentary featuring the Barro Colorado Island titled ''World's Last Great Places: Rain Forests'' released in 2007. The first selection, titled ''Panama Wild: Rain Forest of Life'' features scientists from the Smithsonian's Tropical Research Institute and also highlights the battles for survival and partnerships among species within this richly diverse ecosystem.

==Forest dynamics plot==
In 1980, a 50-ha [[forest dynamics]] plot was established on Barro Colorado Island by researchers from STRI and [[Princeton University]]. The first census was conducted in 1982 and recorded every free-standing tree and shrub in the plot of more than 1-cm [[diameter at breast height|dbh]], totalling approximately 240,000 stems of 303 different species. It has been recensused every 5 years since 1985, allowing scientists to study the normal dynamics of the forest, as well as extreme events, such as [[El Niño]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctfs.si.edu/site/Barro+Colorado+Island |title=Barro Colorado Island

==Visiting==
Visitors are allowed on Barro Colorado Island. Access is, however, regulated by STRI. To visit the island, people must make a reservation with the staff and arrange for a tour. Tours generally include transportation to and from the island (often by boat from Gamboa), a 2–3 hour guided hike, lunch, and a visit to the museum. Hikes through the island offer the opportunity to spot several animals including monkeys, anteaters, birds and insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Barro Colorado Island|url=http://www.anywherepanama.com/attractions/national-park/barro-colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ([[STCW]]), requires that seafarers be provided with "familiarization training" and "'''basic safety training'''" which includes basic [[fire fighting]], elementary [[first aid]], personal [[survival techniques]], and personal safety and [[social responsibility]]. This training is intended to ensure that seafarers are aware of the hazards of working on a vessel and can respond appropriately in an emergency.

According to STCW, The STCW 95 Code requires that you take this 5-day course of instruction. This course has to be renewed every 5 years, or under certain conditions, you have to show that you have at least 1 year of service on board vessels of 200 grt or more within the last 5 years. The components generally includes a Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting (Basic Fire fighting) course of  2 days, a Personal Survival Techniques (PST) course of 1.5 days, a Personal Safety and Social Responsibility (PSSR) course of  half a day, and, First Aid / CPR (Basic First Aid) course of  1 day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edumaritime.net/stcw-courses/basic-safety-training-bst Basic Safety Training Components]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Safety Training or BST is the starting point for persons seeking employment in the maritime industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.net/washington/fremont-maritime-services-seattle Maritime Employment Requirement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency Training or BOSIET is designed for marine personnel intending to work on an offshore installation in the UK maritime sector and forms part of a Common Offshore Safety Induction process.

The '''Bibikely Biodiversity Institute''' (pronounced ''bee-bee-KAY-lee'') is the primary research and training organization for the study of [[arthropod]]s in [[Madagascar]].

Since the first inventory in 1992, the Institute's activities have evolved into one of the most important projects for the advancement of arthropod training and research across Madagascar.

The Institute was founded in 1992 by Dr. [[Brian Fisher (biologist)|Brian Fisher]], preeminent field [[biologist]], and the curator and chairman of the [[entomology]] department of the [[California Academy of Sciences]].  Dr. Fisher is also the present executive director of the Institute.

==Projects==
===Inventory===
This project has become one of the largest arthropod inventory programs ever undertaken. 

Over the last 12 years, field crews have inventoried 112 sites across Madagascar.  In Madagascar, a team of 15 taxonomic assistants sorted and processed over a million specimens.  For ants alone, over 800 new species have been discovered.  The Arthropod Inventory of Madagascar project has demonstrated the feasibility of the effort to collect, process, and prepare enormous quantities of taxonomically rich specimens across diverse, large-scale landscapes.

Inventory of the island's rich arthropod fauna remains incomplete, but the success of the current effort has brought us closer to achieving this goal.

===Education===
Many students receive a significant part of their education working with the Institute.  A particular focus is training students from Madagascar.

===Biodiversity Center===
The Institute is the driving force behind the incipient [[Madagascar Biodiversity Center]].

==Support==
The following organizations have provided funding for the Institute:
*The [[National Science Foundation]]
*[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]
*[[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF)
*The McBean Family foundation
*Private individuals

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===
{{Nature timeline}}
[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

===Goldilocks conditions===
[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Earth]] is ideally located in a [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks condition]]—being neither too close nor too distant from the Sun.]]
A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

===David Christian===
One exponent is [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian was also affiliated with [[San Diego State University]] in [[California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf San Diego State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209212647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

{{Quote|Welcome to First Year Experience ''Big History'' at Dominican University of California.

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a "coherent form of research and teaching" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

[[File:Bill gates portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Philanthropist [[Bill Gates]] is a major advocate of encouraging instruction in Big History.]]

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5913">'''"Chicken Fat"''' (also known as '''"The Youth Fitness Song"''') is a 1962 song written by [[Broadway Musicals|Broadway]] composer [[Meredith Willson]] (''[[The Music Man]]'', ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'') and performed by actor/singer [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  It was commissioned as part of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness]].&lt;ref name=Riis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riis|first1=Richard|title=Apple's "Chicken Fat" Ad Harks Back to a Political Era Long Gone|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/09/1305530/-Apple-s-Chicken-Fat-Ads-Hark-Back-to-a-Political-Era-Long-Gone|accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Chicken Fat" was the theme song for President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s youth fitness program, and millions of 7-inch 33 RPM discs which were pressed for free by [[Capitol Records]] were heard in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[junior high school]] gymnasiums across the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=JFKPE&gt;{{cite web| title= The Federal Government Takes on Physical Fitness | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Physical-Fitness.aspx?p=2 | page=2 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson contacted Fitness Council administrator [[Dick Snider]] with an offer to write a song to be used to promote exercise for children.  Willson's offer was accepted and he consulted with Physical Fitness Council director Ted Forbes to ensure that the song would be effective.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The bouncy chorus ended with the words "Go, you chicken fat, go!"&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

The song was originally recorded on a [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] soundstage in early 1962 at the same time as the  recordings for the film soundtrack of the Warner Bros. film [[The Music Man (1962 film)|''The Music Man'']], starring [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]].  Recorded on the same three-track 35MM magnetic film as the soundtrack recordings, it features Preston's vocal isolated on one track, with the Bernie Green  Orchestra isolated on the second track and a chorus of boys and girls isolated on the third track. However, the location of the original multi-track tapes is unknown. As a result, with only the full-track quarter-inch 15 IPS monophonic composite master being available from which Capitol mastered their records in 1962, no [[stereophonic]] version of the song is currently possible and it remains in monophonic sound on the CD re-issue.&lt;ref name=JFKPE/&gt;

Two versions of the song exist: a 2:12 minute, radio-friendly length, “Disc Jockey Version"; and a longer, 6:30 “School Version”, for use in educational institution [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFKPE /&gt; The latter included 11 floor exercises for school children designed by [[Bud Wilkinson]], the head coach of the [[University of Oklahoma]] football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/13/chicken_fat_song_apple_iphone_5s_commercial_uses_kennedy_era_exercise_anthem.html|title=The Strange 1960s Gym-Class Anthem in Apple's New iPhone Commercial|first=Ben|last=Yagoda|authorlink=Ben Yagoda|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willson, Preston, and Forbes all donated their services to the project , while Capitol Records, which produced and distributed three million copies of the 33 1/3 RPM record, paid for the backup musicians, studio time, and production and distribution.&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt; The original Physical Fitness Council was promoted in 1962 and 1963 through a series of public service TV commercials featuring baseball great [[Stan Musial]], filmed at [[Roosevelt Elementary School (Tampa, Florida)|Roosevelt Elementary School]] in Tampa, Florida.  

In 2014, "Chicken Fat" was used in a TV commercial by [[Apple Inc.]] to promote its new [[iOS 8]] [[Health (Apple)|health]] application. The commercial shows people swimming, running, and checking their weight while connected to iPhone apps and accessories to a recording of "Chicken Fat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-wants-you-to-get-rid-of-chicken-fat-using-its-iphone/|title=Apple wants you to get rid of 'chicken fat' using its iPhone|first=Shara |last=Tibken|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781770/apple-iphone-ad-strength-fitness-with-wearables-and-apps|title=New Apple ad urges you to shed that 'chicken fat'|first=Rick|last=McCormick|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported to be a 2000 recording by [[Bernie Knee]], a jingle writer and part-time cantor, which was released by [[Kimbo Educational Music]],&lt;ref name=Riis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://detroitkidshow.com/chicken_fat.htm|title=Poultry in Motion|publisher=Detroit Kid Show|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he died in 1994.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernie Knee Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/bernie-knee/biography/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, it was reported that it was a new recording but that Apple would not name the singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Stuart|title=Q. and A.

'''Civil Affairs''' ('''CA''') is a term used by both the United Nations and by military institutions (such as the US military), but for different purposes in each case.

==Civil Affairs in United Nations Peace Operations==
Civil affairs officers in UN peace operations are civilian staff members who are often at the forefront of a mission’s interaction with local government officials, civil society, and other civilian partners in the international community. "Civil Affairs components work at the social, administrative and sub-national political levels to facilitate the countrywide implementation of peacekeeping mandates and to support the population and government in strengthening conditions and structures conducive to sustainable peace.",&lt;ref&gt;DPKO/DFS Policy Directive on Civil Affairs (April 2008)http://www.peacekeepingbestpractices.unlb.org/pbps/Library/DPKO-DFS%20Policy%20Directive%20on%20Civil%20Affairs.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil affairs components are deployed in most peacekeeping missions led by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and are also a feature of many special political missions led by the Department of Political Affairs. Civil Affairs 
Officers are usually deployed at the local level, where they serve as the link between the UN mission and local authorities and communities. Civil affairs components work countrywide to strengthen the social and civic conditions necessary to consolidate peace processes and are a core function of multi-dimensional peacekeeping operations. As of mid-2013, there were approximately 700 Civil Affairs Officers in 13 UN Peacekeeping Operations worldwide.

Civil Affairs components perform one or more of three core roles, depending on the UN Security Council mandate given to a particular peacekeeping mission. In each role the work of Civil Affairs intersects with, supports and draws upon the work of a variety of other actors. Depending on the mandate, the three core roles are 1) Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level; 2) Confidence-building, conflict management and support to reconciliation; and 3) Support to the restoration and extension of state authority.

===The roots of Civil Affairs in UN Peace Operations===

There were precursors for what was later termed civil affairs in Central America and in Cambodia during the 1991 to 1993 period. For example, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)’s civil administration component was responsible for the supervision of administrative structures in Cambodia, ranging from public security to finance and information.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Durch, UN Peacekeeping, American Policy and the Uncivil Wars of the 1990s
(Henry L. Stimson Center, 1996) and Steven R. Ratner, The New UN Peacekeeping: 
Building Peace in Lands of Conflict after the Cold War (St. Martin’s Press, 1995), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first component known officially as ”civil affairs” was formed in 1992, with the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR)’s mandate in the former Yugoslavia.

The development and growth of civil affairs work has been a critical element of the development and growth of multidimensional peace operations. With the end of the cold war and the increase in peace operations required to respond to intra-state 
conflict, the UN was increasingly asked to tackle complex civilian tasks. These went beyond the quite limited role of liaising with political actors and the “good offices” work that had characterized civilian peacekeepers until that point. Cedric Thornberry, the first Director of Civil Affairs in a UN mission (UNPROFOR in 1992), described this new broader role as follows:

''To fully understand the UN’s meaning of “civil affairs” it is first important to appreciate that most of the missions created between 1989 and 1992, especially, were qualitatively different from those which had preceded. It is not just that most were a lot bigger … they were to fulfil many roles  additional to the archetypal ones of the 1947-1988 period. The task of the UN 
became, not merely to observe, but actively, itself, to bring about peace […] In a rapid sequence of major operations – principally in Namibia, Central America and Cambodia – the UN was required not only to make peace, but to conduct nationwide processes of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Their task was, in broad terms, to harmonize or unify deeply divided societies, long racked by war, and to establish democracy where previously there had been tyranny.''&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Thornberry, ”Civil affairs in the development ofUNpeacekeeping”, International Peacekeeping, 
vol. 1, No. 4 (1994), pp. 471– 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

These key themes of helping to unify divided societies and helping states to exert legitimate authority are central to the continuing role of civil affairs today.

During the 1990s small civil affairs components were included in a number of missions, including those in Cyprus, Tajikistan and Georgia. At the end of that decade, major civil affairs components were deployed to Kosovo and East Timor, to implement the 
executive mandates that were given to peacekeeping operations at that time. In these cases civil affairs components found themselves mandated to establish effective administrations and to support capacity-building for self-government.

The start of the 2000s saw a surge in the deployment of large civil affairs components to peacekeeping missions. Each one had its own unique focus and contribution to make in implementing peace mandates at the local level, but each was there to 
strengthen links to ordinary citizens, as well as to support the development of social conditions conducive to peace and provide an overall facilitation role locally.

===Civil Affairs into the Next Decade===

In 2008, for the first time, the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support developed and disseminated a policy directive that defines and conceptualizes the diverse work of civil affairs. This has provided the foundation for the development of this Handbook, as well as training and recruitment profiles to ensure that civil affairs components are strong, well-trained and well planned, ready to address the challenges ahead.

This institutional framework will need to continue to evolve and develop in response to analysis of the ongoing shifts in the global security environment. The World Bank's World Development Report 2011, for example, found that many countries are caught in a mutually reinforcing cycle of violence and poverty. It also found that more and more people are suffering from violence that is linked to lack of governance and rule of law, rather than to outright war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/0,,contentMDK:23252415~pagePK:478093~piPK:477627~theSitePK:477624,00.html|title=World Development Report 2011 — Conflict, Security, and Development|year=2011|website=web.worldbank.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in the global security environment have resulted in mandates increasingly requiring higher levels of civilian engagement on a wide variety of thematic and cross-cutting issues, ranging from governance, rule 
of law and institution-building through to early peacebuilding and protection of civilians from threats of violence.

For peacekeeping, of particular note among these emerging issues is the protection of civilians, which has increasingly become a major part of the international discourse around intervention. This was demonstrated in the international dialogue on both 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Côte d'Ivoire in early 2011 and earlier in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Darfur. Protection of civilians has also increasingly become a specific mandated task, after inclusion in eight UN peacekeeping mandates by the Security Council. It can be expected that civil affairs will be at the forefront of an integrated and coordinated approach to mandate delivery on this issue, in terms of civilian and government engagement on the ground.

Meanwhile, as many peacekeeping operations mandated as part of a surge during the 2000s are starting to draw down their military presence, the UN continues to evolve, transitioning towards an increased focus on the civilian dimension of ”peacebuilding” and its role in avoidance of a return to conflict. Here, civil affairs has a key role to play – 
within both peacekeeping and political missions – by ensuring that efforts to mitigate conflict drivers and to engage and support local government and communities have meaning on the ground outside the capitals in which the UN is deployed. A continued focus on local presence in these contexts is key if the UN is to ensure that its work genuinely responds to the priorities and concerns of ordinary citizens within postconflict countries, thereby helping to ensure their consent and to create durable conditions for peace.

These evolving roles, and the range of partners working in related fields and capacities, all create the need – and potential – for increased partnership and cooperation, to ensure that mandate aims progress effectively. Similarly, as these complex and 
multidimensional trends for the UN response to conflict emerge, the identification and provision of appropriate and available resources to respond to them effectively must also evolve. As indicated in the report of the Senior Advisory Group on Civilian 
capacity in the aftermath of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;(A/65/747—S/2011/85); http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/reports.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; these challenges will require a nimble, harmonized and, where necessary, specialized civilian response, as well as a focus on partnership across organizations such as the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and regional organizations such as the African Union (AU).

One of the major issues identified in the review of civilian capacities is the need to be able to better identify and support national capacities. As the review states: “The United Nations has seen success in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping, built on a strong partnership with Member States. But the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential for an enduring peace.”19 Civil affairs components have a key role to play in identifying and supporting national capacities, within civil society and local government, including through helping to ensure that voices from the local level are heard in nationally led peacebuilding processes.

Overall, in the evolving environment of international peace and security, a key asset of civil affairs components is their agility and their capacity to respond flexibly to the wide range of demands and expectations within Security Council mandates. 
One aspect of this flexibility is their ability to direct their focus depending on the availability and presence of other international partners at the local level, particularly those with expertise in highly specialized areas. Civil affairs can play an important role in mobilizing these partners in places and at times where they are most needed. This is a cost-efficient model, given the prohibitive and unnecessary expense of having a full complement of specialized expertise available in each locality around the country at all times. It also helps to ensure that local-level support is need-driven, rather than simply 
provided because a particular service or resource happens to be available.

Civil affairs can be expected to remain at the forefront of the UN response to conflict, and to building the processes, structures, relationships and trust required to assist countries and communities to break the cycle of violence.

===Core Role 1: Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level===

Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation are performed in most missions and usually throughout the life cycle of the mission. In many situations civil affairs is the most important interface between the UN mission and the community, 
not just in terms of the local/regional authorities but also civil society in its broadest sense. Through its multiple interactions with the local population, civil affairs provides the mission with the pulse of the nation beyond the high-level contacts with government and political party leadership. This helps to nuance the mission’s understanding of the sociopolitical climate, allowing analysis to move beyond the carefully articulated positions of national spokespeople and representatives, and to ensure that regional and local considerations are integrated into national negotiations or priority-setting processes.

In return, local communities and groups have an opportunity through civil affairs to access the mission, which they may perceive as distant and militarized. Civil affairs can be a bridge, which means that groups who previously would not have dared to approach the heavily guarded mission gates and ask for a discussion with the mission field leadership, civilian or military, can now approach the UN as guests rather than supplicants. The mission is inevitably enriched by this kind of dialogue and Civil Affairs Officers are often the best facilitators of it.

===Core Role 2: Conflict management, confidence-building and support to the development of political space===

Conflict management, confidence-building and supporting the development of political space are integral to UN peacekeeping and central to civil affairs work. Through this role, civil affairs actively supports the development of social and civic 
conditions conducive to sustainable peace, and promotes popular engagement and confidence in the peace process. While often the lead component in this area of work, civil affairs usually undertakes these activities in partnership with other mission components, as well as UN agencies and local and international partners. Within the mission, police and military components and other civilian components, such as political affairs, public information and human rights, may all contribute in one way or another to objectives in this area.

===Core Role 3: Support to the restoration and extension of state authority===

Restoration of state authority is increasingly recognized as a key element of the stabilization of fragile states and a critical requirement for keeping and building peace. This is clearly reflected in many of the recent UN Security Council resolutions including, for example, Security Council resolution 1974 (2011), which calls for the Government of Afghanistan “to improve governance” and “to pursue continued legislative and public administration reform in order to ensure good governance”. In the case of Haiti, meanwhile, Security Council resolution 1892 (2009) “calls upon MINUSTAH, consistent with its mandate, to continue such support to strengthen self-sustaining state institutions, especially outside Port-au-Prince, including through the provision of specialized expertise to key ministries and institutions”.

In exceptional circumstances, the Security Council has also authorized peacekeeping missions to temporarily assume the administrative and legislative functions of the state through provision of a transitional administration, as was the case in Kosovo and TimorLeste. However, it is important to emphasize the specificity of the circumstances under which these two missions were established and the fact that executive mandates are generally seen as a last resort in situations where a territory is virtually deprived of any functioning state institutions.

==US military civil affairs==

According to the [[U.S. Army]], "Civil Affairs units help military commanders by working with civil authorities and civilian populations in the commander’s area of operations to lessen the impact of military operations on them during peace, contingency operations and declared war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bragg.army.mil/sorb/CA_what_is_CA.htm/ |title=What is Civil Affairs? |author=U.S. Army |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their expertise in civil matters, they are the principal unit in assisting a commander in the conduct of [[civil-military operations]].

CA units act as a liaison between the civilian inhabitants of a warzone or disaster area and the military presence, both informing the local commander of the status of the civilian populace as well as effecting assistance to locals by either coordinating military operations with [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and IGO's or distributing directly aid and supplies.

Consisting primarily of civilian experts such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, police, firemen, bankers, computer programmers, farmers, and others, CA soldiers provide critical expertise to host-nation governments and are also able to assess need for critical infrastructure projects such as roads, clinics, schools, power plants, water treatment facilities, etc. Once a project has been decided on, a contract is put out at a [[civil-military operations center]] for local contractors to come and bid. CA teams will periodically check up on the status of the project to make sure the money is being well-spent.

CA provides the commander with cultural expertise, assesses the needs of the civilian populace, handles civilians on the battlefield, refugee operations, keeps the commander informed of protected targets such as schools, churches, hospitals, etc., and interfaces with local and international NGOs and private volunteer organizations, which provides the commander with a unique battlefield overlay of all civilian activity, ongoing infrastructure projects, and the presence and mission of NGOs in the area.

===History of US military civil affairs===
{{Main|History of Civil Affairs}}
Throughout U.S. history the U.S. Army was involved in Civil Affairs and [[Civic action program|civic action]]. Civil Affairs has its origins in military governments that were and are established when a country is occupied during war.

===United States Army===
[[File:Civilaffairs-firstaid.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Spc. Danielle Curtis with the 401st Civil Affairs Battalion, Webster, New York, demonstrates to students the proper way to apply a field dressing during a basic first aid class at the Mehry Girls School in the city of Herat, Afghanistan, April 29, 2004.]]

96% of the civil affairs personnel come from the [[United States Army Reserve]] and usually support active duty Army units. Using reservists allows military commanders to utilize skills of soldiers with experience in professions needed to manage and restore civilian areas impacted by military operations.  This includes lawyers, city managers, economists, veterinarians, teachers, policemen, and other occupations who have valuable skills in restoration of governance and essential services in a war torn area. As a result, they deploy with certifications and experiences that become difficult to duplicate by the active duty forces. Additionally, reserve civil affairs planners attend the stability, security, and development in complex operations course taught at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

Reserve civil affairs units assigned to [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command]] (Airborne) are task organized in four reserve civil affairs commands (CACOMs) which integrate at the strategic and operational level with theater commands and joint/combined task forces. Civil affairs brigades comprise these CACOMS and integrate at the corps. At the tactical level, maneuver divisions are augmented by the civil affairs battalions. The four CACOMs are the [[350th Civil Affairs Command|350th CACOM]], the [[351st Civil Affairs Command|351st CACOM]], the [[352nd Civil Affairs Command|352nd CACOM]], and the [[353rd Civil Affairs Command|353rd CACOM]].

Two other Army Reserve civil affairs units are assigned to other theaters of operation.  The 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Hawaii and falls under operational control of United States Army Pacific Command and the 9th Mission Support Command.  The 361st Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Germany and falls under operational control of United States Army Europe and the 7th Civil Support Command.

====Active Duty Civil Affairs====
The remaining 4% of civil affairs personnel are active component soldiers assigned to the [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade]], the 85th Civil Affairs Brigade or Army Theater, Corps, Division and Brigade G9/S9 positions. Active component civil affairs soldiers are civil affairs generalists, selected from around the Army.

The [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade]] and its five subordinate battalions are all stationed at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], which is a rapidly deployable unit that only supports the Army Special Operations Command.  Each of the five battalions is regionally aligned to one of the five U.S. combatant commands; SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM and PACOM.  The civil affairs soldiers in these units receive formal language and regional instruction as part of their qualification course and are assigned to the battalion affiliated with the respective region they are trained for. Once these soldiers arrive to their assigned units they receive advance training in a variety of fields, making them the spearhead of Civil Affairs Units in the Army.

The 85th Civil Affairs Brigade,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hood.army.mil/85thCA/ 85th Civil Affairs Brigade]&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Hood, Texas, activated in 2011 but later deactivated in 2017, provided direct support to Active Component Conventional Forces and fell under the command of [[United States Army Forces Command]]. 
The brigade had five subordinate battalions stationed across the continental United States.  The brigade headquarters and one battalion (81st Civil Affairs Battalion) were co-located at Ft. Hood, Texas. The other battalions were located at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina (83rd Civil Affairs Battalion) and Ft. Stewart, Georgia (82nd Civil Affairs Battalion). Previously, the brigade had two additional battalions at Fort Bliss, Texas (80th) and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (84th) which were deactivated summer 2016. The 83rd Civil Affairs battalion will remain activated and will fall under the 16th Military Police Brigade for administrative purposes at Fort Bragg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolasinski|first1=Amanda|title=Civil affairs battalion to remain at Fort Bragg|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20171001/civil-affairs-battalion-to-remain-at-fort-bragg|accessdate=15 January 2018|publisher=The Fayetteville Observer|date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a civil affairs battalion of any component will contain a headquarters company, and one civil affairs company for each maneuver brigade (four to six civil affairs tactical companies). Each civil affairs company contains civil affairs teams (known as CATs) which integrate at the maneuver battalion level. There will usually be one civil affairs team per maneuver battalion. In this manner, the division will have operational control over a civil affairs battalion, a brigade will have operational control over a civil affairs company and an infantry battalion will have tactical control over a civil affairs team. The civil affairs battalion retains administrative control for its elements deployed in theater.

The civil affairs battalion and its subordinate companies and teams become organic parts of their maneuver unit, augmenting the unit's S-9 or G-9 Civil Military Operations Cell, providing cultural expertise, functional specialty expertise, direct support tactical civil affairs, and establishing civil-military operations centers (known as CMOCs, CIMICs or CMCCs, depending on the doctrine in use) and [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s for the geographic area the maneuver unit is responsible for.

{{Main|United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command}}
Within the United States Army, reserve civil affairs units are administered through [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command]] (Airborne), or USACAPOC(A), a subordinate of [[U.S. Army Reserve Command]]. USACAPOC(A) contains [[Psychological Operations]] (PO) and Civil Affairs (CA) units, consisting of Army Reserve elements. USACAPOC(A) was founded in 1985. It is headquartered at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]].

On 1 October 2006, USACAPOC(A) realigned from the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) to the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Training and doctrine relating to USACAPOC(A) is provided by the United States Army John Fitzgerald Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) at Fort Bragg, NC.

=====US Army civil affairs training=====
* Reserve Civil Affairs
**Initial Entry Training (IET)
Upon completion of [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]], a Soldier slotted in a Civil Affairs Unit will attend the 10-week Civil Affairs Advanced Individual Training (AIT) course. The 3rd Battalion of the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) is responsible for the training. Both Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations trainees are assigned to Alpha Company. Upon completion of the 10-week course, (the original 13-week course was lengthened to 15 weeks in 2008, then shortened to 10 weeks in 2010) the student will be able to interpret U.S. and foreign maps; conduct civil, governmental, humanitarian, and defense assistance; apply organizational and leadership skills required in field operations; and conduct research on documents and other aspects of urban and regional studies. The instruction is conducted by lecture, discussion, and practical exercises such as map reading, land navigation, communications, and civil affairs planning.
* Reserve enlisted soldiers who reclassify to Civil Affairs must attend the Civil Affairs Reclassification Course which is offered at several posts throughout the country. Currently, training for combat, combat support, and combat service support is organized through regional training commands. The six Civil Affairs schoolhouses report to the 3rd Brigade (CA/PO) [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th Division]], located at [[Fort Totten (New York)|Fort Totten]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. These units are the 5th Battalion (CA), 95th Regiment, of [[Lubbock]], [[Texas]]; 5th Battalion (CA), 98th Regiment of [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]]; the 12th Battalion (CA), 100th Regiment of [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]; the 4th Battalion (CA), 104th Regiment, of [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California (U.S. state)|California]]; 108th Regiment of [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].

The [[American Council on Education]] recommends [[Course credit|college credit]] be awarded in the lower-division [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] or [[associate's degree]] category two semester hours in [[map]]-reading, three in [[public administration]], and one in [[military science]] for this training. The soldier is awarded the [[United States military occupation codes|Military Occupational Specialty]] designation of 38B10. All [[Active duty|Active Component]] enlisted will attend airborne school and language school, while Reservists attend these courses at a later date through their units.

* Active Duty Forces via Branch Transfer
** Active Component enlisted Soldiers and officers in the rank of [[sergeant]] and [[staff sergeant]] or 1LT and CPT who have a valid [[security clearance]] are considered by attending a rigorous selection course at Camp MacKall, NC. Those soldiers selected to reclassify to Civil Affairs must attend the 48-week Qualification Course (CA SPEC). During this course, Soldiers learn to prepare, execute, and transition CA core tasks, CA operations (CAO), and civil-military operations (CMO). Training is mission-oriented and encompasses language and culture to include the Special Operations Language Training, allowing for maximum hands-on use of CAO/CMO doctrinal procedures during practical exercises (PEs) and a culminating exercise (CULEX) that exposes students to realistic operational situations and environmental elements.  Follow on courses often include Special Operations Medic Course, airborne, SERE-C, interagency planning, additional language training, weapons courses, off road mobility courses, and others.

The training conducted is offered over an abbreviated period of four weeks. Newly enlisted Civil Affairs Soldiers attend a fast-paced 13-week course, which includes land navigation training (mounted and dismounted), weapons training (rifle and pistol), [[night vision device]] training, negotiations training and an extensive field training exercise held at [[Camp Mackall]], North Carolina, located 50 miles outside of Fort Bragg. As of 2005, only one of 10 Soldiers that enlisted in the Army qualified for Civil Affairs/Psychological Operations MOS. Since 2008, the drill sergeants that made the AIT one of the toughest in the United States Army, have been no longer a part of the AIT course (the AIT course did not fall under normal [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) commands like every other AIT). Students must complete the Nasty Nick (Special Forces) Obstacle Course before graduation.
* Officer training
Civil Affairs is a branch for both active duty and reserve officers.  In the past, active duty officers were only awarded a functional area while reserve component received a reclassification to civil affairs branch upon completion of all training.

Active duty officers, upon completion of Civil Affairs Assessment and Selection, must attend airborne school if not already qualified, and the Captain's Career Course and the Civil Affairs Qualification Course (CAQC) on Fort Bragg, NC.  Officers must be of a certain year group prior to being allowed to apply to attend Civil Affairs training and, in general, will have reached the rank of Captain prior to attending the CAQC.

The qualification course is approximately one year long consisting of language training, culture training, and MOS specific training.  Following graduation, officers are assigned to the [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade (United States)|95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne)]] or to the 85th Civil Affairs Brigade. Reserve Component officers are assigned directly to a Reserve Civil Affairs unit and attend language training, Airborne school, and other military schools through their home station unit.

===United States Marine Corps===
The Marine Corps currently has four permanent CA units: [[1st Civil Affairs Group]] (1st CAG), [[2nd Civil Affairs Group|2nd CAG]], [[3rd Civil Affairs Group|3d CAG]] and [[4th Civil Affairs Group|4th CAG]], all in the [[Force Headquarters Group]] of the [[Marine Forces Reserve]]. 5th and 6th CAGs were created provisionally in 2005-06 for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], but each were stood down after one deployment to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Marines magazine.

The Marine Corps assigns civil affairs as a primary military specialty for enlisted and additional specialty for officers. The Marine Corps uses its own civil affairs doctrine and runs the Marine Corps Civil Military Operations School at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] to train civil affairs Marines.

There is some history to the Corps and Civil Affairs.  "During WWII the Civil Affairs people of the 2nd Marine Division were behind the construction of  Camp Churo on Tinian.  They had the 18th Seabees build the camp for the 11,000 Japanese and Korean civilians that were on the island when it was taken".&lt;ref&gt;VI Corps Engineers webpage,18TH N.C.B.

===United States Navy===
{{main|Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command}}
The [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]] (NECC) officially established its newest command, Maritime Civil Affairs Group (MCAG) during a ceremony at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]] on 30 March 2007. In an effort to consolidate staffs and resources, CNO Notice 5400 of 9 July 2009 redesignated MCAG and Expeditionary Training Groups as [[Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command|Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training (MCAST) Command]] and relocated the command to [[Virginia Beach]].  MCAST Command officially stood up 1 October 2009.

Maritime Civil Affairs Teams (MCATs) lessen the impact of military operations imposed during peace and periods of [[Declaration of war|declared war]], and increase the impact of [[humanitarian civil assistance]] (HCA) and contingency operations in support of theater security cooperation plans.

MCA forces provide assistance with the restoration of local infrastructure in the aftermath of military operations, natural and man-made disasters and regional engagement activities in order to achieve shared mutual interests.

In order to maximize its effectiveness, each deployed MCAT is regionally focused and trained with the necessary language skills and cultural awareness. The teams are responsible for streamlining and coordinating the efforts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).

Each Maritime Civil Affairs sailor is responsible for shaping the regional perception of the U.S. and gaining the support of the local populace, preventing it from being influenced by forces of instability, such as terrorism, piracy, crime and natural disaster.

===United States Air Force===
The Air Force has deployed united in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom that have directly integrated into Army Civil Affairs Battalions. Such units include the 16th Squadron, 732nd Expeditionary Air Wing (Civil Affairs/Public Works) which was assigned to the [[411th Civil Affairs Battalion (United States)|411th Civil Affairs Battalion]]. During the 402nd Civil Affairs BN deployment to Iraq in April 2006 to April 2007, members of the United States Air Force provided Airman for logistical support for HHC and for the Provincial Reconstruction Teams throughout their area of operations.

===Other organizations===

====New York State Guard====
In the [[New York State Guard]], one of approximately 25 states with [[state defense force]]s, (not to be confused with the New York [[Army National Guard]]), the term 'Civil Affairs' has a slightly different connotation. The Civil Affairs units include lawyers, judges, engineers, doctors and other professionals and paraprofessionals committed to voluntary, part-time military service in support of the New York National Guard and U.S. Military Reserve Units from all branches. When soldiers are called up for duty, the New York Guard makes sure their legal needs are attended to so that they can serve with the peace of mind of knowing that their affairs are in order. Civil Affairs soldiers draft their wills, prepare powers of attorney and other necessary documents, and advise them of their rights as soldiers under federal law and as citizens of the United States. There are five units, one in each brigade of the Guard, including the 5th Civil Affairs Regiment, Yonkers, NY; 7th Civil Affairs Regiment, New York City, NY; 13th Civil Affairs Regiment, Garden City, NY; 23rd Civil Affairs Regiment, Latham, NY; and the 209th Civil Affairs Regiment, Buffalo, NY.

==Civil affairs worldwide==

===United Kingdom===
The [[British Army]] has a Civil Affairs Group, formed in 1997 and consisting primarily of [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. Most personnel are members of the [[Royal Engineers]] and the group is administered by the Central Volunteer Headquarters Royal Engineers (CVHQ RE), based at [[Gibraltar Barracks, Minley|Gibraltar Barracks]], in [[Minley]], [[Surrey]]. Members of the group have been deployed operationally in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  In Afghanistan, the tactical level unit was called Military Stabilisation Support Team, and they usually worked for the [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]].

The British Army first formed CA units in 1943, and by August 1944 there were 3,600 CA personnel in [[France]] with the [[British 21st Army Group|21st Army Group]].

===The Netherlands===
The [[Royal Netherlands Army]]'s Civil Affairs unit is 1 [[CIMIC]] Battalion. The staff consist of regular soldiers. Other personnel are reservists with a civilian occupation. Members of the battalion have been deployed to [[Bosnia]]; [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]; [[Africa]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The unit is, as of early 2009, based in [[Apeldoorn]].

==Civil affairs in popular media==

The term '''cognitive neuroscience''' was coined by [[George Armitage Miller]] and [[Michael Gazzaniga]] in year 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gazzaniga|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael S. Gazzaniga|date=1984|title=Handbook of Cognitive Neuroscience|pages=vii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the [[Biology|biological]] processes and aspects that underlie [[cognition]],&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, Ivry and Mangun 2002, cf. title&lt;/ref&gt; with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in [[mental process]]es. It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain.  Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]], overlapping with disciplines such as [[behavioral neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[physiological psychology]] and [[affective neuroscience]].&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv"&gt;Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience relies upon theories in [[cognitive science]] coupled with evidence from [[neurobiology]], and [[Computational neuroscience|computational modeling]].&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga 2002, p. xv"/&gt;

Parts of the brain play an important role in this field. [[Neuron]]s play the most vital role, since the main point is to establish an understanding of cognition from a neural perspective, along with the different lobes of the [[cerebral cortex]].

Methods employed in cognitive neuroscience include experimental procedures from [[psychophysics]] and [[cognitive psychology]], [[functional neuroimaging]], [[electrophysiology]], [[cognitive genomics]], and [[behavioral genetics]].

Studies of patients with cognitive deficits due to brain [[lesion]]s constitute an important aspect of cognitive neuroscience. The damages in lesioned brains provide a comparable basis with regards to healthy and fully functioning brains. 
These damages change the neural circuits in the brain and cause it to malfunction during basic cognitive processes, such as [[memory]] or [[learning]]. With the damage, we can compare how the healthy neural circuits are functioning, and possibly draw conclusions about the basis of the affected cognitive processes.

Also, cognitive abilities based on brain development are studied and examined under the subfield of [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]]. This shows brain development over time, analyzing differences and concocting possible reasons for those differences.

Theoretical approaches include [[computational neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]].

==Historical origins==
[[File:Historycognitiveneuroscience.jpg|thumb|alt=Timeline of development of field of cognitive neuroscience|Timeline showing major developments in science that led to the emergence of the field cognitive neuroscience.|400px]]

Cognitive neuroscience is an interdisciplinary area of study that has emerged from [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press."&gt;Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several stages in these disciplines that changed the way researchers approached their investigations and that led to the field becoming fully established.

Although the task of cognitive neuroscience is to describe how the brain creates the mind, historically it has progressed by investigating how a certain area of the brain supports a given mental faculty. However, early efforts to subdivide the brain proved to be problematic. The phrenologist movement failed to supply a scientific basis for its theories and has since been rejected. The aggregate field view, meaning that all areas of the brain participated in all behavior,&lt;ref name="Erickson-Davis"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ida.mtholyoke.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10166/626/153.pdf?sequence=1 | title=Neurofeedback Training for Parkinsonian Tremor and Bradykinesia | accessdate=2013-05-23 | author=Cordelia Erickson-Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also rejected as a result of brain mapping, which began with [[Hitzig]] and [[Gustav Fritsch|Fritsch]]’s experiments&lt;ref name="G. Fritsch, E. Hitzig, Electric excitability of the cerebrum (Über die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns), Epilepsy &amp; Behavior, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 123-130, ISSN 1525-5050, 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.03.001."&gt;G. Fritsch, E. Hitzig, Electric excitability of the cerebrum (Über die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns), Epilepsy &amp; Behavior, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 123-130, ISSN 1525-5050, 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.03.001.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually developed through methods such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref name="Raichle 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raichle | first1 = Marcus E. | year = 2009 | title = A brief history of human brain mapping | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 118–126 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2008.11.001| pmid = 19110322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]], [[neuropsychology]], and the [[cognitive revolution]] were major turning points in the creation of cognitive neuroscience as a field, bringing together ideas and techniques that enabled researchers to make more links between behavior and its neural substrates.

===Origins in philosophy===
Philosophers have always been interested in the mind: "the idea that explaining a phenomenon involves understanding the mechanism responsible for it has deep roots in the History of Philosophy from atomic theories in 5th century B.C. to its rebirth in the 17th and 18th century in the works of Galileo, Descartes, and Boyle. Among others, it’s Descartes’ idea that machines humans build could work as models of scientific explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirgiovanni|first1=Elisabetta|title=The Mechanistic Approach to Psychiatric Classification|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=45–49|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-C09-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[Aristotle]] thought the brain was the body’s cooling system and the capacity for intelligence was located in the heart. It has been suggested that the first person to believe otherwise was the Roman physician [[Galen]] in the second century AD, who declared that the brain was the source of mental activity,&lt;ref name="Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press"&gt;Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; although this has also been accredited to [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref name="Gross, C, G. (1995) Aristotle on the Brain. The Neuroscientist(1) 4."&gt;Gross, C, G. (1995) Aristotle on the Brain. The Neuroscientist(1) 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galen believed that personality and emotion were not generated by the brain, but rather by other organs. [[Andreas Vesalius]], an anatomist and physician, was the first to believe that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion.&lt;ref name="Smith, C, U. (2013). Cardiocentric neurophysiology. the persistence of a delusion.

===19th century===

====Phrenology====
[[Image:Phrenology-journal.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A page from the ''American Phrenological Journal'']]
{{Main article|Phrenology}}
One of the predecessors to cognitive neuroscience was [[phrenology]], a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] approach that claimed that behavior could be determined by the shape of the [[scalp]]. In the early 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] and [[J. G. Spurzheim]] believed that the human brain was localized into approximately 35 different sections. In his book, The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, Gall claimed that a larger bump in one of these areas meant that that area of the brain was used more frequently by that person. This theory gained significant public attention, leading to the publication of phrenology journals and the creation of phrenometers, which measured the bumps on a human subject's head. While phrenology remained a fixture at fairs and carnivals, it did not enjoy wide acceptance within the scientific community.&lt;ref name=" Bear et al. 2007, pp. 10-11"&gt;Bear et al. 2007, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The major criticism of phrenology is that researchers were not able to test theories empirically.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt;

====Localizationist view====
The localizationist view was concerned with mental abilities being localized to specific areas of the brain rather than on what the characteristics of the abilities were and how to measure them.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt; Studies performed in Europe, such as those of [[John Hughlings Jackson]], supported this view. Jackson studied patients with [[brain damage]], particularly those with [[epilepsy]]. He discovered that the epileptic patients often made the same [[clonus|clonic]] and tonic movements of muscle during their seizures, leading Jackson to believe that they must be occurring in the same place every time. Jackson proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Enersen, O. D. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which was critical to future understanding of the [[brain lobes]].

====Aggregate field view====
According to the aggregate field view, all areas of the brain participate in every mental function.&lt;ref name="Erickson-Davis"/&gt;

[[Pierre Flourens]], a French experimental psychologist, challenged the localizationist view by using animal experiments.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt; He discovered that removing the [[cerebellum]] in rabbits and pigeons affected their sense of muscular coordination, and that all cognitive functions were disrupted in pigeons when the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s were removed. From this he concluded that the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brainstem]] functioned together as a whole.&lt;ref name = "Boring, E.G. (1957). A history of experimental psychology. New York. "&gt;Boring, E.G. (1957). A history of experimental psychology. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach has been criticised on the basis that the tests were not sensitive enough to notice selective deficits had they been present.&lt;ref name="Kosslyn, S, M. &amp; Andersen, R, A. (1992). Frontiers in cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT press." /&gt;

====Emergence of neuropsychology====
Perhaps the first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by [[Paul Broca|Broca]] and [[Wernicke]]. This was mostly achieved by studying the effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions.&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT PressUttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, French neurologist Paul Broca came across a man who was able to understand language but unable to speak. The man could only produce the sound "tan". It was later discovered that the man had damage to an area of his left frontal lobe now known as [[Broca's area]]. Carl Wernicke, a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]], found a patient who could speak fluently but non-sensibly. The patient had been the victim of a [[stroke]], and could not understand spoken or written language. This patient had a lesion in the area where the left parietal and temporal lobes meet, now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. These cases, which suggested that lesions caused specific behavioral changes, strongly supported the localizationist view.

====Mapping the brain====
In 1870, German physicians [[Eduard Hitzig]] and [[Gustav Fritsch]] published their findings about the behavior of animals. Hitzig and Fritsch ran an electric current through the cerebral cortex of a dog, causing different muscles to contract depending on which areas of the brain were electrically stimulated. This led to the proposition that individual functions are localized to specific areas of the brain rather than the cerebrum as a whole, as the aggregate field view suggests.&lt;ref name="G. Fritsch, E. Hitzig, Electric excitability of the cerebrum (Über die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns), Epilepsy &amp; Behavior, Volume 15, Issue 2, June 2009, Pages 123-130, ISSN 1525-5050, 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.03.001." /&gt; [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann]] was also an important figure in brain mapping; his experiments based on Franz Nissl’s tissue staining techniques divided the brain into fifty-two areas.

===20th century===

====Cognitive revolution====
At the start of the 20th century, attitudes in America were characterised by pragmatism, which led to a preference for [[behaviorism]] as the primary approach in [[psychology]]. [[John B. Watson|J.B. Watson]] was a key figure with his stimulus-response approach. By conducting experiments on animals he was aiming to be able to predict and control behaviour. Behaviourism eventually failed because it could not provide realistic psychology of human action and thought – it focused primarily on stimulus-response associations at the expense of explaining phenomena like thought and imagination. This led to what is often termed as the "cognitive revolution".&lt;ref name="Mandler, G. (2002) Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. J. Hist. Behav. Sci. Fall 38(4)339-53."&gt;Mandler, G. (2002) Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. J. Hist. Behav. Sci. Fall 38(4)339-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuron doctrine====
{{Main article|Neuron doctrine}}
In the early 20th century, Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Camillo Golgi began working on the structure of the neuron. Golgi developed a [[Golgi's method|silver staining method]] that could entirely stain several cells in a particular area, leading him to believe that neurons were directly connected with each other in one cytoplasm. Cajal challenged this view after staining areas of the brain that had less myelin and discovering that neurons were discrete cells. Cajal also discovered that cells transmit electrical signals down the neuron in one direction only. Both Golgi and Cajal were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for this work on the neuron doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/|title= The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-late 20th century ===
Several findings in the 20th century continued to advance the field, such as the discovery of ocular dominance columns, recording of single nerve cells in animals, and coordination of eye and head movements. Experimental psychology was also significant in the foundation of cognitive neuroscience. Some particularly important results were the demonstration that some tasks are accomplished via discrete processing stages, the study of attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carrasco |first1=Marisa |title=Visual attention: The past 25 years |journal=Vision Research |date=2011 |volume=51 |issue=13 |pages=1484–1525 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.012|pmid=21549742 |pmc=3390154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kastner |first1=Sabine |last2=Ungerleider |first2=Leslie G. |title=Mechanisms of visual attention in the human cortex |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |date=2000 |volume=23 |pages=315–41|pmid=10845067 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the notion that behavioural data do not provide enough information by themselves to explain mental processes. As a result, some experimental psychologists began to investigate neural bases of behaviour. 
Wilder Penfield created maps of primary sensory and motor areas of the brain by stimulating cortices of patients during surgery. Sperry and Gazzaniga’s work on split brain patients in the 1950s was also instrumental in the progress of the field.&lt;ref name="Uttal, W, R. (2011). Mind and brain: A critical appraisal of cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press" /&gt;

====Brain mapping ====
New brain mapping technology, particularly [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[positron emission tomography|PET]], allowed researchers to investigate experimental strategies of [[cognitive psychology]] by observing brain function. Although this is often thought of as a new method (most of the technology is relatively recent), the underlying principle goes back as far as 1878 when blood flow was first associated with brain function.&lt;ref name="Raichle 2009" /&gt; [[Angelo Mosso]], an Italian psychologist of the 19th century, had monitored the pulsations of the adult brain through neurosurgically created bony defects in the skulls of patients. He noted that when the subjects engaged in tasks such as mathematical calculations the pulsations of the brain increased locally. Such observations led Mosso to conclude that blood flow of the brain followed function.&lt;ref name="Raichle 2009" /&gt;

==Emergence of a new discipline==

===Birth of cognitive science===
On September 11, 1956, a large-scale meeting of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] took place at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] presented his "[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]]" paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704|year=1956 |title=The magical number seven plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=81–97 |citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Allen Newell|Newell]] &amp; [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] presented their findings on [[computer science]]. [[Ulric Neisser]] commented on many of the findings at this meeting in his 1967 book ''Cognitive Psychology''. The term "psychology" had been waning in the 1950s and 1960s, causing the field to be referred to as "cognitive science". Behaviorists such as Miller began to focus on the representation of language rather than general behavior. [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]] concluded that one should understand any cognitive process at three levels of analysis. These levels include computational, algorithmic/representational, and physical levels of analysis.&lt;ref name="weebly.com"&gt;[http://jungminded.weebly.com/cognitive-psychology/approaches-in-cognitive-psychology Approaches in Cognitive Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combining neuroscience and cognitive science===
Before the 1980s, interaction between neuroscience and cognitive science was scarce.&lt;ref name="petemandik.com"&gt;not available, http://www.petemandik.com/philosophy/papers/brookmadik.com.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} not available&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive neuroscience began to integrate the newly laid theoretical ground in cognitive science, that emerged between the 1950s and 1960s, with approaches in experimental psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. (Neuroscience was not established as a unified discipline until 1971&lt;ref&gt;Society for Neuroscience. Date of the first meeting of the Sociefy for Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;). In the very late 20th century new technologies evolved that are now the mainstay of the methodology of cognitive neuroscience, including [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] (1985) and [[fMRI]] (1991). Earlier methods used in cognitive neuroscience include [[EEG]] (human EEG 1920) and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] (1968). Occasionally cognitive neuroscientists utilize other brain imaging methods such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]]. An upcoming technique in neuroscience is [[Near infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]] which uses light absorption to calculate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin in cortical areas. In some animals [[Single-unit recording]] can be used. Other methods include [[microneurography]], facial [[Electromyography|EMG]], and [[eye tracking]].  [[Integrative neuroscience]] attempts to consolidate data in databases, and form unified descriptive models from various fields and scales: biology, psychology, anatomy, and clinical practice.&lt;ref name="boundless.com"&gt;https://www.boundless.com/psychology/history-psychology/origin-psychology/growth-of-psychology-as-a-science--31/{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Stanislas Dehaene]], [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] and [[Trevor Robbins]], were awarded the [[Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Prize|Brain Prize]] "for their pioneering research on higher brain mechanisms underpinning such complex human functions as literacy, numeracy, motivated behaviour and social cognition, and for their efforts to understand cognitive and behavioural disorders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebrainprize.org/flx/prize_winners/prize_winners_2014|title=The Brain Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brenda Milner]], [[Marcus Raichle]] and [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] received the [[Kavli Prize]] in Neuroscience “for the discovery of specialized brain networks for memory and cognition"&lt;ref name="Kavli"&gt;http://www.kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/prizes/2014-kavli-prize-laureates-neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt; and O'Keefe shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in the same year with [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] "for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain".&lt;ref name="nobelmedicine"&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Wolfram Schultz]], [[Peter Dayan]] and [[Ray Dolan (scientist)|Ray Dolan]] were awarded the Brain Prize "for their multidisciplinary analysis of brain mechanisms that link learning to reward, which has far-reaching implications for the understanding of human behaviour, including disorders of decision-making in conditions such as gambling, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour and schizophrenia".,&lt;ref name="2017BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallager|first1=James|title=Scientists win prize for brain research|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39183178|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=BBC|date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major contributors to the field ==

=== Hubel and Wiesel – 1960s ===
[[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]], both [[Neurophysiologist|neurophysiologists,]] studied the [[visual system]] in cats to better understand [[sensory processing]]. They performed experiments which demonstrated the specificity of the responding of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubel|first=D. H.|last2=Wiesel|first2=T. N.|date=1959-10-01|title=Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=148|issue=3|pages=574–591|issn=0022-3751|pmc=1363130|pmid=14403679|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiments showed that neurons fired rapidly at some angles, and not so much at others. A difference was also found in light and dark settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubel|first=D. H.|last2=Wiesel|first2=T. N.|date=1962-01-01|title=Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=160|issue=1|pages=106–154.2|issn=0022-3751|pmc=1359523|pmid=14449617|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies gave rise to the idea of complex visual representations being formed from relatively simple stimuli.

They also discovered the [[simple cell]] and [[complex cell]]. These exist in the primary visual cortex and respond differentially to differently oriented presentations of light.

==Recent trends==
Recently the foci of research have expanded from the localization of brain area(s) for specific functions in the adult brain using a single technology, studies have been diverging in several different directions: exploring the interactions between different brain areas, using multiple technologies and approaches to understand brain functions, and using computational approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Takeo|first=Watanabe|title=Cognitive neuroscience Editorial overview|url=http://people.bu.edu/takeo/takeo/Editorial%20(Current%20Opinion).pdf|access-date=2011-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224221332/http://people.bu.edu/takeo/takeo/Editorial%20(Current%20Opinion).pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Advances in non-invasive functional neuroimaging and associated data analysis methods have also made it possible to use highly naturalistic stimuli and tasks such as feature films depicting social interactions in cognitive neuroscience studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasson|first=Uri|title=Intersubject Synchronization of Cortical Activity During Natural Vision |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/303/5664/1634.short|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5956">{{About|the concept of cultural pluralism|other uses of the term|Pluralism (disambiguation)}}
'''Cultural pluralism''' is a term used when smaller groups within a larger [[society]] maintain their unique [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]], and their [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] and practices are accepted by the wider culture provided they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. As a sociological term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Hazard and Madelon Stent, "Cultural Pluralism and Schooling: Some Preliminary Observations," Cultural Pluralism in Education: A Mandate for Change, eds. Madelon Stent, William R. Hazard and Harry N. Revlin (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1973), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural pluralism is distinct from (though often confused with) [[multiculturalism]]. Multiculturalism lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Social and Cultural Pluralism as a Concept in Social System Analysis ;Marie R. Haug; Vol. 73, No. 3 (Nov., 1967), pp. 294-304; Published by: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example of pluralism is 20th Century [[United States]], in which a dominant culture with strong elements of [[nationalism]], a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms {{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}. In 1971, the Canadian government referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the "very essence" of their nation's identity&lt;ref&gt;''Library and Archives Canada. Canada. Parliament. House of Commons. Debates, 28th Parliament, 3rd Session, Volume 8 (8 October 1971) ; [http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/canadian-multiculturalism-policy-1971 Canadian Multicultural Policy 1971]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; In a pluralist culture, groups not only co-exist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of [[Social integration|integration]] on members, rather than expectations of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture.

The idea of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the [[transcendentalist]] movement and was developed by [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophers such as [[Horace Kallen]], [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and later thinkers such as [[Randolph Bourne]]. One of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralistic ideas can be found in Bourne's 1916 essay "Trans-National America".&lt;ref&gt;Science Encyclopedia [http://science.jrank.org/pages/10750/Pluralism-Cultural-Pluralism.html Cultural Pluralism] Retrieved on May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Horace Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Horace M.

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the concept was further explored in [[M. Crawford Young|Crawford Young]]'s book ''The Politics of Cultural Pluralism''. Young's work, in African studies, emphasizes the flexibility of the definition of cultural pluralism within a society.&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Cultural Pluralism; Young, Crawford; The University of Wisconsin Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent advocates include moral and cultural anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]]. In 1976, an article in the ''Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare'' offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism in which it is described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pantoja, Antonia; Perry, Wilhelmina; and Blourock, Barbara (1976) "Towards the Development of Theory: Cultural Pluralism Redefined," ''The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare'': Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 11.

'''Disciplining gendered bodies''' is the practice of conforming one's body to society's standards and expectations.

There are various visible ways in which people and cultures consciously and unconsciously maintain binary [[heteronormative]] norms, which involve choices of female or male gender actions and performances.  Common body practices, or gestures, are combined with gender expectations that make it hard to recognize these practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication|last=Palczewski|first=Catherine|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=United States|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three examples of heteronormative disciplines are gendered [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]], embodied space, and body movement.

==Gendered attractiveness==

Gendered attractiveness is the physical appearance of a male or female that is considered ideal, beautiful, attractive and having [[sex appeal]] of oneself or others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males, for example, should be large in stature, muscular, full head of hair, straight white teeth, healthy and alluring to look at.  They spend many hours trying to perfect their bodies with [[physical exercise]]. They also make changes to their appearance with hair removal, hair plugs, teeth veneers and body tanning.   Males want to be seen as strong, dominant and masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Realities, Women's Choices|last=Hunter College|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-984360-2|location=New York, NY|pages=148–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females, on the other hand, should be slender, tall, have long blonde hair, perfect skin and [[Barbie]] doll-like features. Females want to be characterized as petite, skinny and fit. Females are concerned about how they look, what they wear and they desire to be attractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|last=Shaw|first=Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=978-0-07-802700-0|location=New York, NY|pages=181–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus go to great lengths to make sure that they feel and look attractive and polished. Females make permanent changes to their bodies as they have [[cosmetic surgery]] on all areas of their bodies such as, nose, face, lips, chin, teeth, breast, buttock, feet and many other parts of the body.  Females also make temporary changes such as cut and color hair, tanning for darker skin color, hair removal from body, paint finger and toe nails. In addition, females use clothes, shoes and accessories such as scarfs, jewelry, purses and eyeglasses to help make them feel and look attractive.

==Embodied space==

Embodied space is the way males and females familiarize with their bodies in their surroundings and often compare to each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The area of personal and interpersonal space tends to be diverse and has various levels for different genders and how it is used to disciple one’s self and others. Males and females also experience their bodies in different ways such as females are more guarded in the way they experience their bodies than males who are less guarded. The size of personal space also had to do with gender. Females compared to males take up less space and males tend to spread out. An example would be when a female sits in a chair they normally sit straight up with legs crossed and when male sits in the chair they sprawl out and legs are spread.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Body movement==

Body movement is how one moves their bodies or how someone's attitude or manners help to express how one carries themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each gender has specific flow or body movements that are normal for them.  Females experience their bodies in more guarded way, how to hamper their movement and do not bring their whole bodies into motion. Females are told how to sit, stand and walk properly. Females are more nonverbal and tend to use more facial expressions and more body movement than males. Males are taught to use and abuse their bodies and put their bodies into an aggressive motion. Males have more expansive movements and show higher levels of activity than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philip|first1=C|title=Study the Latest Research and Learn the Nuance of Body Language|url=http://bodylanguageproject.com/articles/mens-body-movement-more-extroverted-and-emotionally-stable-says-research/|website=Articles|accessdate=2016-05-15|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecphonesis''' ({{lang-el|ἐκφώνησις}}) is an emotional, exclamatory phrase ([[wikt:exclamation|exclamation]]) used in poetry, drama, or song. It is a [[rhetorical device]] that originated in ancient literature.

A Latin example is [[O tempora o mores!|"O tempora! O mores!"]] ("Oh, the times! Oh, the morals!"). A modern example is "Young man!" from the song [[Y.M.C.A. (song)|YMCA]] by the [[Village People]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] used ecphonesis in “[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]:” &lt;blockquote&gt;"Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! "'Villains!' I shrieked, 'dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up the planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other examples of ecphonesis include when Homer Simpson said "No! No-no-no-no-no-no! Well, yes." during ''The Simpsons'' episode "Homer The Heretic,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homer The Heretic|url=http://simpsons-scripts.wikidot.com/homer-the-heretic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when the Scarecrow said "Oh joy! Rapture! I got a brain!" in ''The Wizard of Oz.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Oz (1939) Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] has used the expressions "Sad!" and "Wrong!" without elaboration throughout his 2016 presidential campaign.

== In Eastern Orthodox Liturgy ==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] many prayers are recited silently by the priest who "speaks to God face-to-face" according to St. [[Symeon of Thessaloniki]].  However, the closing words of such prayers are usually chanted aloud, especially at the closing of an [[ectenia|ectenia (litany)]], and those closing words are called an '''ecphonesis'''.

''Examples:''

* In the [[anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]] (eucharistic prayer), the prayer following the [[sanctus]] is said silently by the priest but its ending, the [[Words of Institution]], are intoned in a loud voice.
* During most [[ectenia]]s the priest silently recites a prayer up to its last line and then, when the ectenia has concluded, he chants aloud that last line.

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fry, ''Design in the Borderlands'' (2014) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Week for Waste Reduction (EWWR)'''&lt;ref name="EWWR"&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/EWWR ACR+ - EWWR presentation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was launched as a 3-year project supported by the LIFE+ Programme of the [[European Commission]] until July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1588&amp;format=PDF&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en European Commission - Environment Policy &amp; Governance, LIFE + Projects 2007], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This source doesn't seem to reference the European Week for Waste Reduction anywhere|date=March 2013}} It continues taking place in the following years. The 2012 edition of the EWWR took place from the 17 to 25 November 2012 under the patronage of Mr Janez Potočnik, European Commissioner for the Environment. 
It aims to organize multiple actions during a single week, across Europe, that will raise awareness about [[waste reduction]]. Each year, the most outstanding actions are rewarded during an awards ceremony in Brussels at the heart of the European institutions. Since the beginning of the project, more than 20.000 awareness raising actions on waste prevention have been implemented in the framework of the EWWR.

The 2017 date is from November 18-27.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewwr.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five partners of this project are:
* '''ADEME''' (the French Environment and Energy Management Agency – project coordinator)
* '''ACR+''' (the Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and sustainable Resource management – project technical secretariat)
* '''ARC''' (the Catalan Waste Agency)
* '''IBGE''' (Brussels Environment, public administration for the environment and energy)   and
* '''LIPOR''' (the Intermunicipal Waste Management Service of [[Greater Porto]]).

==Purpose==
* To raise awareness about waste reduction strategies and about the policies of the European Union and its Member States on this subject
* To promote sustainable waste reduction actions across Europe
* To highlight the work accomplished by various actors, through concrete examples of waste reduction
* To encourage changes in the behaviour of Europeans (consumption, production) in everyday life

==Target audience==
* '''Public authorities across Europe''' that have competence in the field of waste prevention that responded to a Call for Interest launched by the official partners of the project. These EWWR Organisers act as coordinators of the Week in the area covered by their authority, thereby ensuring the registration and validation of actions proposed by various Project Developers.
* '''Project developers''' interested in carrying out awareness raising actions on the subject of waste prevention during the Week, with the aim of informing the greatest possible number of citizens. These Project Developers register their proposals for EWWR actions through the national, regional or local Organiser covering their area.
:'''5 categories of Project Developer:'''
** Administration/public authority
** Association/NGO
** Business/industry
** Educational establishment
** Other (for example : hospital, retirement home, cultural centre etc.).
* '''European citizens''' who participate in actions set up by Project Developers during the Week and learn about the kind of waste reduction habits that they can take up in everyday life.

==Five themes of the EWWR==
* Too much waste
* Better production
* Better consumption
* A longer life for products
* Less waste thrown away

'''Feminist ethics''' is an approach to [[ethics]] that builds on the belief that traditionally ethical theorizing has under-valued and/or under-appreciated [[women]]'s [[moral]] experience, which is largely male dominated, and it therefore chooses to re imagine ethics through a holistic [[feminist]] approach to transform it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/ Tong, R. and Williams N., Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Feminist Ethics, First published Tue May 12, 1998; substantive revision Mon May 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Feminist [[philosophers]] critique traditional ethics as pre-eminently focusing on men's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] with little regard for women's viewpoints. Caring and the [[moral]] issues of private life and family responsibilities were traditionally regarded as trivial matters. Generally, women are portrayed as ethically immature and shallow in comparison to men. Traditional ethics prizes masculine cultural traits like "independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,"&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"&gt;Jaggar, "Feminist Ethics," 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and gives less weight to culturally [[feminine]] traits like "interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life."&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt; Should women embody or use any traditionally masculine cultural traits they are seen as other or as an attempt to be more like men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, New York:Routledge. Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ethics has a "male" orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework of rules, rights, universality, and impartiality and becomes the standard of a society. The "female" approaches to moral reasoning emphasizes relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality.&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt;

==Historical background==
Feminist ethics developed from [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s '[[Vindication of the Rights of Women]]' published in 1792.&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Abruzzese|first1 =Jaclyn|last2 =Brayne|first2=Allison|last3 = Shastri|first3 = Julie |last4 = Sakofsky|first4 = Rachel|last5 = Hewitt|first5= Nancy|last6 = Sklar |first6 = Kathryn|date = Spring 2002|url = http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/intro.htm|title = From Wollstonecraft to Mill: What British and European Ideas and Social Movements Influenced the Emergence of Feminism in the Atlantic World, 1792-1869?|website = Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600-2000| publisher = Alexander Street Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new ideas from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], individual feminists being able to travel more than ever before, generating more opportunities for the exchange of ideas and advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Jennifer L.|title=The Mothers of a Movement: Remembering 19th-Century Feminists|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/highlights/feminists.html|website=Documenting the American South|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; With new [[social movements]] like [[Romanticism]] there developed unprecedented optimistic outlook on human capacity and destiny. This optimism was reflected in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s essay [[The Subjection of Women]] (1869).&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"/&gt; Feminist approaches to ethics, were further developed around this period by other notable people like [[Catherine Beecher]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] with an emphasis on the gendered nature of [[morality]], specifically related to 'women's morality'.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"/&gt;

===Charlotte Perkins Gilman===
The American writer and sociologist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] imagined a fictional "[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]". In this male-free society, women produce their daughters through [[parthenogenesis]] and live a superior morality. This women-centered society valued both industriousness and motherhood while discouraged individualistic competitive approaches to life. Gilman thought that in such a scenario women could relate cooperatively as there would be no requirement to dominate each other. Herland cultivates and combines the best "feminine" virtues and the best "masculine" virtues together as co-extensive with human [[virtue]]. If a society  wants to be virtuous, according to Gilman, it should exemplify the fictional utopia of Herland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gilman|first = Charlotte Perkins |title = Herland|url = https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gilman/charlotte_perkins/herland/|date =1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; However so long as women are [[Codependence|dependent]] on men for economic support, women will continue to be known for their servility and men for their arrogance. Women need to be men's economic equals before they can develop truly human moral virtue, this is a perfect blend of pride and humility that we call [[self-respect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Gilman| first = Charlotte Perkins| title = Women and Economics|location = Boston|publisher = Small, Maynard, &amp; Co.|date = 1898|url = http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/economics/economics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist care ethics==
{{main|Ethics of care}}
[[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]] are exponents of a feminist care ethics which criticize traditional ethics as deficient to the degree they lack, disregard, trivialize or attack women's cultural values and virtues.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"&gt;Noddings, N., Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century feminist ethicists developed a variety of care focused feminist approaches to ethics in comparison to non-feminist care-focused approaches to ethics, feminist ones tend to appreciate the impact of gender issues more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, C., In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist care-focused ethicists note the tendencies of patriarchal societies not to appreciate the value and benefits of women's ways of loving, thinking, working and writing and tend to view females as subordinate.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"/&gt; This is why some social studies make a conscious effort to adopt feminist ethics, rather than just the traditional ethics of studies. An example of this was Roffee and Waling's 2016 study into microaggressions against the LGBTIQ community. Even though it was focused on the LGBTIQ community the feminist ethics were better suited, as they are more considerate to the vulnerabilities and needs of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical fields also fail to recognize that ethics plays an often negative part in the LGBTIQ community in how they receive treatment and what treatments are given as options to them. As well a how women are also treated within medical fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohrmann|first=M|date=2015|title=Feminist Ethics and Religious|url=|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|volume=43(2)|pages=185-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist justice ethics==
{{Main|Feminist justice ethics}}
[[Feminist justice ethics]] is a feminist view on morality which seeks to engage with, and ultimately transform, traditional universal approaches to [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 68. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations.  Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented.  However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics.  A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics &lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;but depending on the geographical location, such as the difference between the Global North and Global South, may differ in how justice is applied and may change what is considered justice. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing "thick" morality from "thin" morality.  Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as "thick" accounts of morality.  Feminist justice ethics claims that "thick" accounts of morality, as opposed to "thin" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"/&gt;

==Feminist ethics and the future==
Feminist ethicists believe there is an obligation for women's differing points of view to be heard and then to fashion an inclusive consensus view from them. To attempt to achieve this and to push towards gender equality with men together is the goal of feminist ethics. The fixing of these issues are important in modern times because of the shifting view points as well as what has considered to be 'ethical' in terms of treatment and how women, in particular, women's bodies should be treated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"The goal of feminist ethics is the transformation of societies and situations where women are harmed through violence, subordination and exclusion. When such injustices are evident now and in the future, radical feminist activists will continue their work of protest and action following careful appraisal and reflection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLellan|first1=Betty|title=Unspeakable: A feminist ethic of speech|date=February 2010|publisher=OtherWise Publications|isbn=978-0-646-51778-0|page=240|url=http://feministagenda.org.au/home/otherwise-publications/unspeakable/}}&lt;/ref&gt; With violence, it once again circles back to masculine behavior and traditional ethics that such behavior and treatment was encourages. In today's society, the twentieth century, it is becoming less socially acceptable to commit violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Feminist ethics and International Relations ==
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}
Feminist theories and that of ethics broaden the scope of the predominantly masculine sphere of International Relations. This is especially important for issues of the private realm to take stage into the public which includes issues such as children's rights, gender violence and discrimination, gender relations in war torn societies, and other similar issues which remain difficult to appear relevant in the mainstream discussions of ethics in international relations. The feminist dialogues of ethics are almost inescapably present to the private realm and are known to only shadow dominant 'male' paradigms of ethics in the public realm. This is especially a reality in discussion of ethics in International Relations where it is predominantly built on a language of violence, technologies or economics and what are known to be the masculine topics of discussion.

See '''Kimberly Hutchings''' discussion in "Ethics" for further detail on the foundations of the theory in International Relations  &lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, Kimberly. "Ethics ." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . 2009 . 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection of Authors and applied theory  in International Relations ===
{{Split|Overview of Feminist Ethics Scholars|date=November 2018}}
'''Alison Watson''' &lt;ref&gt;"Children Born of Wartime Rape: Rights and Representations ." International Feminist Journal of Politics (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson discusses the issue of children born of wartime rape and uses feminist theory of ethics in addressing these marginalized issues. The invisibility is emphasized in the traditional construction within much of the existing international discourse of motherhood as a 'private sphere activity'   where important focused issues such as children of wartime rape can be lost in translation of international dialogue and minimally touched upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Alison|title=Children Born of Wartime Rape: RIghts and Representations|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|year=2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist theory of ethics is provided in terms of broadening theoretical dialogues of international relations and addressing issues that remain marginalized.

'''Puechguirbal''' &lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that failure to broaden the current scope of ethics in peacekeeping operations and rebuilding strategies, surrounding arms and violence, results in failing to meet the needs of both men and women. Puechguirbal argues that conflict is a 'gendered experience' and discusses the importance of peacekeeping operations keeping in check the differential impacts of war on women, men, boys and girls in post conflict society so as to not further marginalize the most vulnerable groups of the population&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 171&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, peacekeeping operations are heavily masculine in the sense that security revolves around the cessation of hostilities and disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 163&lt;/ref&gt; Peacebuilding operations must shift the focus from solely disarming and cessation of hostilities against gang members to social constructions of violence against women, men, and children that is embedded in societies broken apart by conflict. Gender issues have not been part of mandates of peacekeeping missions&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:170&lt;/ref&gt; and  urges women to take a more active role in political processes in post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:163&lt;/ref&gt; Applying Feminist ethics in peacekeeping and re-building strategies can reach a wider range of issues as well as deemed not of dire importance in dialogues of International Relations. Current strategies are not reaching target goals of generating peace and cessation of   gender violence and sexual abuses that continue to reach high levels in incidences. This remains a residue of post-conflict societies that must be addressed. Implementing feminist ethics generates greater peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies for gendered strategies to meet the needs of both genders so as to be implemented into not only the institutions but society.

== Feminist ethics and Being Transgender. ==
When applying feminist ethics and care, it is important to consider in what way does that apply to those who are transgender, either Female to Male or Male to Female. As there is a historical with ethics being deeply rooted in religious ethics. For those who are transgender and wish to be identified as their preferred gender have to apply either masculine or feminine ethics in both appearance and thinking to pass. One notable mention is when “Halberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of “sex-change” serves to “fictionalize” gender (i.e., render or expose as artificial) … a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example…”&lt;ref&gt;•	Halberstam, Judith, 1994, “F2M: The making of female masculinity”, in ''The lesbian postmodern'', Laura Doan (ed.), New York: Columbia University Press, 210–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">In [[marketing]], '''geomarketing''' (also called '''marketing geography''') is a discipline that uses [[geolocation]] ([[Geography|geographic]] information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the [[marketing mix]] – the product, price, promotion, or place ([[geo targeting]]).  [[Market segments]] can also correlate with location, and this can be useful in targeted marketing.

Geomarketing isapplied  in the financial sector through identifying ATMs traffic generators and creating hotspots maps based on geographical parameters integrated with customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp Geomarketing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080312045856/http://www.amcham.org.eg/Publications/BusinessMonthly/december%2007/CoverStory.asp |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomarketing has a direct impact on the development of modern trade and the reorganization of retail types. Site selection becomes automated and based on scientific procedures that saves both time and money. Geomarketing uses key facts, a good base map, [[Whois]] data layers, consumer profiling, and success/fail criteria.

[[GPS tracking]] and [[GSM localization]] can be used to obtain the actual position of the travelling customer.

==Geo marketing software==
[[Geolocation software]] is used to display data that can be linked to a geographic region or area.  It can be used to:
* Recommend nearby social events.&lt;ref name = "qr10"/&gt;
* Determine where the customers are (on country, city, street or user level).
* Determine who the customer is (on organisation or user level), or make a guess on it based on earlier encounters by tracking [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php|publisher=IPInfoDB|author=IPInfoDB|title=IP location XML API|date=2010-04-18|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; credit card information, VOIP address, etc.
* Visualize any data in a geographic context by linking it to a digital map.
* Locate a web client's computer on a digital map.
* Calculate summary information for specific areas.
* Select customers within specific areas.
* Select customers with a certain radius of a point.
* Using micro-geographic segmentation select customers similar to a specific type in the rest of the country.

Some of the software used includes [[Geoconcept]] Sales&amp;Marketing Portal, MapInfo, ArcGIS (ESRI), RegioGraph (GfK), WIGeoWeb (WIGeoGIS) assorted open source like Mapwindow, DIVA (which while normally used for bio-diversity creates very visually pleasing density maps), GRASS (which works in Linux and Windows environments) [[GeoEdge]] (tracking local ads and pages). Several other software are available. Indeed, Google Earth provides an excellent set of images that are always useful.

==Applications for Geo==

===Different content by choice===
Location-based social media marketing uses geo-specific tools to draw imaginary perimeters that will display all of the social content posted by users in that particular area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/location-based-social-media-marketing/|title=Location Based Social Media Marketing|author=Lauren Wilson |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=22 August 2016|access-date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical example for different [[web content]] by location is the FedEx website at FedEx.com where users have the choice to select their country geo —location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
Individuals can deliver different content in [[internet marketing]], through paid or organic search results, based on the geographical [[geolocation]] of the targeted audiences.

===Other applications===
* Solve problems regarding location of a new [[retail]] outlet
* Map consumer demand trends to best distribute products and advertising. This links with trade zone management.
* Scope digital advertising towards individual consumers and producers.
* Research consumer shopping patterns and observe traffic within shopping centers and between retail outlets. It also helps in visualisation of market research findings and help improve the overall planning ability of organisations.
* Improve customer cooperation.
* Creation of sales territories

We can define the geo-marketing as a strategy and mechanism that provides valuable information that helps in the process of making business decisions using geographical information. The functions of this to search and evaluate marketing opportunities, analyzing geographical information such as location residential areas, topography, it also analyzes demographic information such as age, genre, annual income and lifestyle. This information can be segmented as primary data and sub-segmented as secondary data; in addition, it helps us to develop successful promotional campaigns achieving our marketing goals. This also works with retail chain stores in the sales industry, real estate, and renewable energy, among others.

With geomarketing, the general data of a company changes to be more specific regarding their customers and market trends. This allows companies to use secondary data wisely, providing excellent results at low cost compared with traditional market research methods. All data is acquired accurately with GPS equipment and geographical information software, once the data is acquired, this information is processed by professionals in the field.

Geomarketing has helped companies to acquire valuable information such as transit behaviors, most visited places or areas, etc., this information will help these companies to deliver the right message (or promotion), at the right time and place. Most companies use their mobile apps to obtain this information. Mobile apps became more sophisticated using GPS, Bluetooth, and also social networks to obtain their market information, this information helps to improve their promotional campaigns. According to [[comScore]], about 60 percent of all Internet activities in the U.S. originates from mobile devices and about half of total Internet traffic flows through mobile apps.

One example of Geo Location is Google Maps - you can search in Google Maps Restaurants near me and it will show different options around your location. One important factor that companies (in this case restaurants) is that they must be sure to optimize their business in Google's directory list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">The idea of [[human geography]] originated rather early in [[China]], about 2,000 years ago. The classical works of [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Chinese history|history]] contained much of the concept of the relationship between human activities and "Tian" (the heaven) or "Di" (the earth), recognizing that both sides were now and then in harmonious state or in contradictory condition, and both sides had their own evolutionary law.

==History==
The John Innes Horticultural Institution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal 
| title = The New John Innes Horticultural Institution 
| journal = Nature 
| volume = 165 
| issue = 4207 
| pages = 955

| doi = 10.1038/165955a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1910 at [[Merton Park]], Surrey (now [[London Borough of Merton]]), with funds bequeathed by [[John Innes (philanthropist)|John Innes]], a merchant and philanthropist. The Institution occupied Innes's former estate at Merton Park until 1945 when it moved to [[Bayfordbury]], Hertfordshire. It moved to its present site in 1967.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/history.htm John Innes Centre, History.] Retrieved 10 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Innes compost]] was developed by the institution in the 1930s, who donated the recipe to the 'Dig for Victory' war effort. The John Innes Centre has never sold John Innes compost.

During the 1980s, the administration of the John Innes Institute was combined with that of the '''Plant Breeding Institute'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/161714b0| title = Plant Breeding Institute, Cambridge| journal = Nature| volume = 161| issue = 4097| pages = 714| year = 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/161714c0| title = Plant Breeding Institute, Cambridge: Dr. G.

In 1994, following the relocation of the operations of other two organisations to the Norwich site, the three were merged as the John Innes Centre.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The institute is divided into six departments: Biological Chemistry, Cell &amp; Developmental Biology, Computational &amp; Systems Biology, Crop Genetics, Metabolic Biology and Molecular Microbiology.&lt;ref name=dept&gt;[http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/science-departments/ John Innes Centre, Science Departments.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162043/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/science-departments/ |date=16 July 2011 }} Retrieved 10 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The John Innes Centre has a tradition of training PhD students and post-docs. PhD degrees obtained via the John Innes Centre are awarded by the [[University of East Anglia]]. The John Innes Centre has a contingent of [[postdoctoral researcher]]s, many of whom are recruited onto the institute's Post-doctoral Training Fellowship programme. The John Innes Centre also sponsors seminars and lectures, including the [[Bateson Lecture]] and the [[Biffen Lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/news-and-events/whats-on/friday-seminars/ | title = Friday Seminars | website = John Innes Centre | access-date = 2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The research at the John Innes Centre is divided into 4 Institute Strategic Programs (ISPs) funded by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council|Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/research/ |title=Research |website=John Innes Centre |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These ISPs, which combine the research of multiple groups to address a greater aim, are: 
*Genes in the Environment -  aims to develop a wider and deeper understanding of how the environment influences plant growth and development.
*Molecules from Nature - will investigate the vast diversity of chemicals produced by plants and microbes.
*Plant Health - aims to understand the molecular dialogue between plants and microbes, establishing how they communicate with each other and how they have evolved in relation to one another.
*Designing Future Wheat - a program with other BBSRC institutes [[Rothamsted Research]] and [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany|National Institute for Agricultural Botany]] (NIAB) and the [[University of Nottingham]] and the [[University of Bristol]].

==Affiliations==
The John Innes Centre is also the Norwich base of the [[Sainsbury Laboratory]],&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;[http://www.tsl.ac.uk/ Sainsbury’s laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; an institute focused on plant disease. Although well integrated with the John Innes Centre, The Sainsbury Laboratory is closely affiliated with the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref name=UEA&gt;[http://www.uea.ac.uk/ University of East Anglia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Institute of Food Research]]&lt;ref name=IFR&gt;[http://www.ifr.ac.uk/ Institute of food research]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA)&lt;ref name="UEA"/&gt;, JIC hosted the BA Festival of Science (now the [[British_Science_Association#British_Science_Festival|British Science Festival]]) in September 2006&lt;ref name=ScienceFestival&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.org.uk:80/BA_FoS_2006.htm |title=BA Festival of Science 2006 |website=Teacher Scientist Network |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109151729/http://www.tsn.org.uk/BA_FoS_2006.htm |archive-date=9 November 2016 |access-date=2017-11-14 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==John Innes Foundation==
The John Innes Foundation (JIF) is an independent charitable foundation (registered Charity No. 1111527) and was formed in 1910 by [[John Innes (philanthropist)|John Innes]]. JIF set up the John Innes Horticultural Institution (JIHI) at Merton, London.

Currently, the JIF owns the land and buildings at Newfound Farm, Colney and Church Farm, Bawburgh, Norfolk which are used by researchers from the John Innes Centre.

The JIF trustees also play an active part in the management of John Innes Centre research and have the right to appoint three members of the Governing Council.

The foundation sponsors several graduate studentships each year, support for educational programmes and the infrastructure of the site. They also fund student awards for scientific excellence and science communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johninnesfoundation.org.uk/jif-studentship-prize-winners/ |title=JIF Studentship Prize Winners |website=John Innes Foundation |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Law's Empire''''' is a 1986 text in legal philosophy by the late Oxford scholar [[Ronald Dworkin]] which continues his criticism of the philosophy of [[legal positivism]] as promoted by [[H.L.A. Hart]] during the middle to late 20th century. The book notably introduces Dworkin's Judge Hercules as an idealized version of a jurist with extraordinary legal skills who is able to challenge various predominating schools of legal interpretation and legal hermeneutics prominent throughout the 20th century. Judge Hercules is eventually challenged by Judge Hermes, another idealized version of a jurist who is affected by an affinity to respecting historical legal meaning arguments which do not affect Judge Hercules in the same manner. Judge Hermes' theory of legal interpretation is found by Dworkin in the end to be inferior to the approach of Judge Hercules.

==Background==
Much of the twentieth century in legal philosophy has been characterized by the confrontation of legal positivism with natural law theory as being among the most prominent legal theories seen in the century. One major proponent of the Anglo-American version of legal positivism was H.L.A. Hart, a professor at Oxford University, who was a teacher of Dworkin's and whom eventually Dworkin would come to strongly disagree with. To challenge the prevailing schools of legal interpretation and legal philosophy in the late twentieth century, Dworkin invented the personage of Judge Hercules to represent a version of legal philosophy which he saw as effectively answering many of the shortcoming he had come to identify with Hart and other legal schools prominent in his time.

Dworkin's approach in the book is to present his argument in ten chapters with one summary chapter added at the end of the book titled, "Law Beyond Law". The book is original in its format compared to conventional approaches to academic studies in the law by introducing the personage of Judge Hercules early in the text to answer many of the legal theories which Dworkin wishes to discuss as to their being insufficient to meet the requirements of late 20th century jurisprudence. In Dworkin's perspective, the prevailing climate of legal theory at the end of the 20th century was understood by him as being represented by the deficiencies of many competing and contradictory legal theories being presented by the legal academy. The ten chapters of the book build their logical argument sequentially and in growing complexity of exposition where each chapter is dependent upon the logical demonstrations made in previous chapters in order to establish the rationale and comprehension at work in the mind of the legal personage represented by Judge Hercules.

==Summary==
The Preface of the book is used by Dworkin to state his primary concern in this volume concerning his approach to the philosophy of law. Dworkin states concisely: "We are subjects of law's empire, liegemen to its methods and ideals, bound in spirit while we debate what we must therefore do." The "empire" of the law is expansive for Dworkin and includes not only the domain of jurisprudence but extends fully into the domain of politics and sociology, including the philosophical domain of morals, ethics and even aesthetics as these affect the lives of all individuals of society.

===Chapter One: What is Law?===
In this chapter, Dworkin tells his readers that there are three types of law with which he is primarily concerned. These three areas of law are outlined as (a) Conventionalism, (b) Pragmatism (semantic theory), and (c) Law as integrity. Dworkin shall make a primary point of defending Law as integrity throughout the subsequent chapters of his text.

===Chapter Two: Interpretive Concepts===
Dworkin introduced his principle of the 'semantic sting' of the semantic philosophy of law. He develops and distinguishes between two forms of skepticism to present his arguments differentiating between "internal skepticism" and "external skepticism", for use in subsequent chapters.

===Chapter Three: Jurisprudence Revisited===
Dworkin informs his readers that the concept of law is the theory of what forms the ground of law. The ground of law is the basis upon which the suppositions for the working and application of law are based and form an unavoidable basis for subsequent discussion of differing concepts of law. The phrase 'concept of law' was used by Hart as the title for an approach to law strongly oriented to Anglo-American reading of positive law to which Dworkin would take exception as to its insufficiency for dealing with issues of jurisprudence encountered throughout the 20th century.

===Chapter Four: Conventionalism===
In this chapter, Dworkin begins his three part, 3-tier assessment of law with his criticism of Conventionalism. He differentiated Conventionalism as falling into two different kinds, which are insufficient, in the end, to the needs of contemporary jurisprudence at the end of the 20th century leading to the start of the 21st century. Dworkin ends the chapter asserting the failure of Conventionalism.

===Chapter Five: Pragmatism and Personification===
Dworkin rejects pragmatism here as insufficient to the requirement of adjudication requirements and legislative principles which he sees as prevailing at the end of the twentieth century. Dworkin begins to stress that contemporary jurisprudence in his view needs to hold in high esteem the values of justice as integrity, fairness and due process.

===Chapter Six: Integrity===
For Dworkin, "Justice is a matter of outcomes: a political decision causes injustice, however fair its procedures that produced it, when it denies people some resource, liberty, or opportunity that the best theories of justice entitle them to have." For Dworkin, the answerability of jurisprudence to political theory and political obligations is central. Poliltical ideals are presented as operating from a base of moral concerns which do influence what is legislated as law.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Law's Empire''. Harvard University Press. 1987.

[[Image:Link_log_diagram.jpg|thumb|alt=Format of a link log record]]

A '''linklog''' is a type of [[blog]] which is meant to act as a linked list.  Common practice is for the post titles to link directly to an external [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, and the content of the post includes information to complement the associated URL.&lt;ref name="octopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/linklog/|title=Writing a Linklog|date=2012-02-12|last1=Mathis|first1=Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linklogs existed as a feature of computing systems before the internet as well.  In distributed file systems a link log was a method of recording data in which a record is created and added to the proper log when updating a transaction.  The format of a log record closely matches the specification of the transaction type it corresponds to.  Link log records consisted of two parts in such a system:  a set of type-independent fields, and a set of type-specific fields.  The former set consists of pointers to the preceding and succeeding records of the log.&lt;ref name="kistler"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disconnected Operation in a Distributed File System|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540606277|archive-url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coda/docdir/jjk-thesis.pdf|archive-date=1993-05-01|format=PDF|last1=Kistler|first1=James|date=1993-05-01|location=School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-60627-0|isbn=9783540606277|issn=0302-9743|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In PBX systems such as [[AUDIX]] link-logs were a collection of data collecting to assist operators in maintaining the system.&lt;ref name="audix"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/003676390|format=PDF|page=35|publisher=Lucent Technologies|title=DEFINITY AUDIX System Release 3.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Mark Antony Wigley''' is a [[New Zealand]]-born architect, author, and (from 2004 to 2014) Dean of [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] [[Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]], [[New York City]], [[United States]].

==Career==
Wigley received both his Bachelor of Architecture (1979) and Ph.D. (1987) from the [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand. Mike Austin was his doctoral supervisor.  Wigley left [[Auckland]] in 1986 and taught at [[Princeton University]], from 1987 to 1999, serving also as the director of Graduate Studies at Princeton’s School of Architecture.

In 1988, Wigley co-curated with [[Philip Johnson]] the [[MoMA]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist Architecture''. The exhibition featured the works of seven architects, who were already well-known at the time for a style of architecture that involved in various ways "deconstructing" conventional notions of architectural convention: [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. The curators linked the works to the philosophical notion of [[Deconstruction]], as espoused by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], as well as the art-architectural historical precedent of [[Russian constructivism]], and several works from this period were displayed in the exhibition. However, of the architects only Eisenman and Tschumi acknowledged the connection to Derrida and only Hadid and Koolhaas to Constructivism.

== Personal life ==
Mark Wigley is married to architectural historian [[Beatriz Colomina]].

==Volume Magazine==
In 2005, Wigley founded [[Volume Magazine]] together with [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Ole Bouman]]. A collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), [[Wharenui|AMO]] Rotterdam and C-lab ([[Columbia University]] NY), [[Volume Magazine]] is an experimental [[think tank]] focusing on the process of spatial and cultural [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]. The magazine aims to explore "beyond architecture’s definition of 'making buildings'" by presenting global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures and created environments; and embodies progressive journalism.

Created and founded in collaboration with Brett Steele the Institute of Failure; essentially an academic institution for the instruction and theory of failure (as opposed to success).

==Awards==
Wigley was awarded the Resident Fellowship, [[Chicago]] Institute for Architecture and Urbanism, 1989; [[International Committee of Architectural Critics]] (C.I.C.A.) Triennial Award for Architectural Criticism, 1990; and the Graham Foundation Grant, 1997.

A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

  | accessdate = 2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, all universities, including [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] [[Jagannath University]], [[Dhaka University]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[Jahangirnagar University]], [[Islamic University, Bangladesh]] and [[Rajshahi University]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. After passing Bachelor of Science, any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of studies. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

==Chile==

Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''[[Karshenasi-arshad]]'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or sometimes a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==India==

In India, universities offer MSc programs usually in science subjects. Generally speaking, in India, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MSc degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MSc. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree where as MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. M.S. degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==

In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. A graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program) or ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities.  Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the USA and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world. Subsequently, students who pass 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs (termed "licencjat". No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp  - KTH|author=|date=|website=www.kth.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;   .

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years, the student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program, the master of science is mostly a research master (except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities), The student should attend some courses in the first year of the master then he/she should prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).&lt;ref name="QAA master's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.&lt;ref name="QAA master's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHEQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.

'''Michael Newton''' is a [[minority language]] [[activist]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] scholar. He was born in 1965 and raised in a bilingual ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] speaking) community in Southern [[California]].&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=MICHAEL NEWTON|url=http://www.celticlifeintl.com/michael-newton/|website=Celtic Life International|publisher=Celtic Life International Magazine|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked on a career in computer game design as a teenager, becoming one of the creators of the pioneering game [[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]] at [[FTL Games]]. After graduating magna cum laude from the [[University of San Diego]] in 1990 with a degree in computer science,&lt;ref name="cv" /&gt; he switched his focus to [[Scottish Gaelic]] studies and in 1998 was awarded a [[PhD]] in [[Celtic Studies]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Newton has produced a number of scholarly projects regarding [[Scottish Gaelic]], including books, articles, edited volumes, blog posts, a video documentary, and [[digital humanities]] [[multimedia]] projects exploring [[Celtic language]] poets in [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|title=Celtic Poets of North America|url=http://celticpoetsna.web.unc.edu|website=unc.edu|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he has received numerous awards, including the Coralys Award in 2002 and 2003 and the inaugural 2014 Saltire Award from [[St. Andrews University]] Scottish Heritage Center. He is a co-founder and board member of [[Urras Gàidhlig nan Stàitean Aonaichte]] (Scottish Gaelic Society of the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|title=Board Member Bio Michael Newton|url=https://gaelicusa.org/board-member-bio-michael-newton/|website=Urras Gàidhlig nan Stàitean Aonaichte|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his work challenges the negative stereotypes that have been projected onto Gaelic society by anglophone authorities and anglocentric sources, drawing on the methods of [[post-colonial studies]].&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; He is one of the only scholars currently studying the legacy of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] immigrant communities of the Americas, especially by locating and analyzing the remains of [[Scottish Gaelic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|title=Scottish-American Pride: Only Skin Deep?|url=https://virtualgael.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/scottish-american-pride-only-skin-deep/|website=The Virtual Gael|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NNEST''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|t}} {{respell|en|NEST|'}}) or '''non-native English-speaking teachers''' is an [[acronym]] that refers to the growing body of English language teachers who speak [[English as a foreign or second language]]. The term was coined to highlight the dichotomy between [[native English-speaking teachers]] (NEST) and non-native English-speaking teachers (NNEST).

Issues related to NNESTs attract the attention of language teachers, language specialists, teacher educators, and graduate students from all over the world. [[TESOL International Association|TESOL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tesol.org/|title=TESOL International Association|work=tesol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Teachers of English to the Speakers of Other Languages) organization has a NNEST Interest Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnest.asu.edu|title=Home Page|work=asu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two local TESOL affiliates in [[North America]], [[WATESOL]] (Washington Area TESOL) and [[CATESOL]] (California TESOL) have NNEST entities.

==Native speaker vs. non-native speaker dichotomy==
Historically speaking, [[native speaker]] is defined as "the first language a human being learns to speak is his native language; he is a native speaker of this language" by [[Leonard Bloomfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|publisher=New York: Holt Rinehart Winston |year=1933|isbn=81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, [[theoretical linguistics]] realm placed [[native speaker]] construct into an idealized position and assumed that [[native speaker]] is the only reliable source of linguistic data by formulating the construct that of an "ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogenous speech community", as defined by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Aspects of Theory of Syntax |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=978-0-262-53007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the construct has been critically discussed in the field of [[English language teaching]]. Some of the researchers argued that [[second language acquisition]] research under the dominance of idealized native speaker model creates a "monolingual bias in [[second language acquisition]] (SLA) theory",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cook| first=Vivian | title= Monolingual bias in second language acquisition research | year=1997 | journal= Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses | volume=34 | pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  "elevates an idealized native speaker above a stereotypical 'nonnative' while viewing the latter as a defective communicator, limited by an underdeveloped communicative competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/329302 | last1=Firth| first1=Alan| last2=Wagner| first2=Johannes |title= On discourse, communication, and (some) fundamental concepts in SLA research | jstor=329302 | year=1997 | journal= Modern Language Journal| volume=81 | issue=3 | pages=285–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it was further argued that the [[native speaker]] "exists only as a figment of linguist's imagination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Native Speaker is Dead!|last=Paikeday |first=Thomas| publisher= Paikeday Publishing| year=1985|isbn= 0-920865-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that it is "more like a myth than a reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Native Speaker in Applied Linguistics|last=Davies|first=Alan|publisher= Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press|year=1991 |isbn=0-7486-0296-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status in ELT profession==
Problematic nature of the [[native speaker]]-[[non-native speaker]] dichotomy was blended with the growing body of literature discussing the unfair treatment and [[marginalization]] of [[non-native English-speaking teachers]] in the [[English language teaching|ELT]] profession. [[Robert Phillipson]] (1992) formulated "[[native speaker fallacy]]", which suggests that the ideal teacher of English is a native speaking teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Linguistic Imperialism | last=Phillipson |first=Robert| publisher= Oxford: Oxford University Press | year=1992 |isbn= 0-19-437146-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a non-native speaking teacher was considered to be a distinct quality by [[George Braine]] (1999)&lt;ref name=Braine1999&gt;{{Cite book |title= Non-native educators in English language teaching | last=Braine |first=George| publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, New Jersey | year=1999 |isbn= 0-8058-3205-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that "the very fact that non-native speakers of a language have undergone the process of learning a language makes them better qualified to teach the language than those who are born to it". 
&lt;br /&gt; The inappropriateness of discriminatory practices against NNESTs in English language teaching profession was highlighted by George Braine (1999)&lt;ref name=Braine1999/&gt; as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...highly ironic, considering the profession's strident championing of multiculturalism, diversity, and other sociopolitical causes, often on behalf of ESL students and immigrants. Although ESL students are praised and admired for the multiculturalism and diversity they bring into language classes, non-native English teachers, who can contribute their rich multicultural, multilingual experiences, are often barred from the same classes."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; [[Peter Medgyes]] (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The non-native teacher | last=Medgyes |first=Peter| publisher= London: Macmillan| year=1994 |isbn= 0-333-60020-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized [[native English-speaking teachers]] as informal, flexible, and confident and characterize NNEST as follows :
* good role models
* effective provider of learning strategies
* suppliers of information about the English language
* better anticipators of language learning difficulties
* sensitive to language learners' needs
* facilitators of language learning as a result of shared [[mother tongue]]
&lt;br&gt; A number of edited volumes were published on issues related to NNESTs.&lt;ref name=Braine1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Learning and Teaching from Experience: Perspectives on Nonnative English-speaking Professionals | last=Kamhi-Stein|first=Lia| publisher= The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor| year=2004 |isbn= 0-472-08998-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Non-native language teachers: Perceptions, challenges, and contributions to the profession | last=Llurda |first=Enric| publisher= New York: Springer | year=2005 |isbn= 0-387-24565-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The NNEST Lens: Nonnative English Speakers in TESOL | last=Mahboob |first=Ahmar| publisher= Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press | year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages of using the term "NNEST"===
There are basically two arguments that support the use of term "[[non-native English-speaking teachers]]". First, it is believed that the term is necessary to distinguish between native and [[non-native English-speaking teachers]] as well as strengths attributed to these groups. Second, it is also believed that the term is necessary to highlight the [[discrimination]] based on the dichotomy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Disadvantages of using the term "NNEST"===
Opponents of the term argue that "differentiating among teachers based on their status as native or nonnative speakers perpetuates the dominance of the native speaker in the ELT profession and contributes to discrimination in hiring practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maum| first=Rosemarie| title=Nonnative-English-speaking-teachers in the English language profession| year=2002| journal=CAL Digest| url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/digest_pdfs/0209maum.pdf| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411022957/http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/digest_pdfs/0209maum.pdf| archivedate=2009-04-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Maum, 2002).
Below are some of the alternatives to replace the term "NNEST":
* Anglophone Teachers of English
* Bilingual English Speaking Teacher (BEST)
* Legitimate Teacher of English
* Transnational English Teacher
* Translinguistic English Teachers&lt;ref&gt;Motha, S., Jain, R., &amp; Tecle, T. (2012). Translinguistic Identity-As-Pedagogy: Implications for Teacher Education. International Journal of Innovation in English Language Teaching and Research, 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Multilingual/Multicultural English-speaking Teachers
* Diverse English-speaking Teachers

==Discriminatory and anti-discriminatory practices==
&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that today, about 80% of English language teachers in the world are [[non-native English-speaking teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Reclaiming the Local in Language Policy and Practice | last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh| publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.| year=2005 |isbn= 0-8058-4593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is no longer considered to be an exclusive possession of native speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Widdowson| first=Henry| title= The Ownership of English | year=1994 | journal= TESOL Quarterly| volume=28 | pages=377–389 | issue=2 | doi=10.2307/3587438}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it "belongs to all people who speak it, whether native and nonnative, whether ESL or EFL, whether standard or non-standard" (Norton 1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Norton| first=Bonny| title= Language, identity and the ownership of English | year=1997 | journal= TESOL Quarterly| volume=31 | pages=409–429 | issue=3 | doi=10.2307/3587831}}&lt;/ref&gt; NNESTs encounter discriminatory practices all around the world. There have been several research studies exploring the hiring preferences of administrators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Flynn| first1=Kathleen| first2=Gulikers|last2=Goedele |title= Issues in hiring nonnative English-speaking professionals to teach English as a Second Language| year=2001 | journal= CATESOL Journal | volume=13 | pages=151–161 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Status of Nonnative English Speakers as ESL Teachers in the United States |last=Mahboob |first=Ahmar| publisher= Ph.D. Dissertation, Indiana University| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.system.2007.05.002 | last1=Clark| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Paran| first2=Amos |title= The employability of non-native-speaker teachers of EFL: A UK survey | year=2007 | journal= System | volume=35 | pages=407–430 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Native and non-native English-speaking English as a second language teachers: Student attitudes, teacher self-perceptions, and intensive English program administrator beliefs and practices |last=Moussu |first=Lucie| publisher= Ph.D. Dissertation, Purdue University| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which empirically demonstrated the importance of 'nativeness' as a job requirement. In addition, online job repositories such as [[Dave's ESL Café]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eslcafe.com/joblist/|title=Dave's ESL Cafe International Job Board - International Job Board|work=eslcafe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronicle of Higher Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/jobs/100/|title=Find Jobs - Vitae|work=Vitae, the online career hub for higher ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[TESOL International Association|TESOL]]'s Online Career Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.tesol.org/|title=TESOL International Association (TESOL), TESOL Career Center-Find Your Career Here|work=tesol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; host job advertisements which include 'nativeness' as a job requirement.
Discriminatory practices against NNESTs in [[English language teaching]] generated a series of institutionalized anti-discriminatory practices such as "Statement on Nonnative Speakers of English and Hiring Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=TESOL| first1= |title= Statement on Nonnative Speakers of English and Hiring Practices| year=1992 | journal= TESOL Matters | volume=2 | pages=23 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Position Statement against Discrimination of Nonnative Speakers of English in the Field of TESOL".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=TESOL| first1= |title= Position Statement against Discrimination of Nonnative Speakers of English in the Field of TESOL | year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was decided in [[ASEAN]] 2005 Conference to establish "Centers for English Language Training" in [[South-East Asian]] countries to support local solutions to local needs by means of local tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Future of English |last=Graddol |first=David | publisher= London: British Council.|year=2006 |isbn=0-86355-356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Graphene Institute''' is a [[research institute]] and building at the [[University of Manchester]] that is focused on the research of [[graphene]]. Construction of the building to house the institute started in 2013&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; and finished in 2015.

== Institute ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The building in 2016]]
The creation of the institute, including the construction of the building, cost £61&amp;nbsp;million. Funded by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] (£38m) and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Regional Development Fund]] (£23m), the building is the national centre for graphene research in the UK. It provides facilities for industry and university academics to collaborate on [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32100071 graphene applications] and the commercialisation of graphene. The building was opened on 20 March 2015 by [[George Osborne]].&lt;ref name="UoM20Mar15" /&gt;

== Building ==
[[File:National Graphene Institute.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The National Graphene Institute under construction in August 2014]]
The five-story glass-fronted building provides {{convert|7,600|sqm|sqft}} of research space. This includes 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of class [[Cleanroom|100 and class 1000 clean rooms]], one of which occupies the entire lower ground floor (in order to minimise vibrations&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;)&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt; plus laser, optical, metrology and chemical laboratories, along with offices, a seminar room and accommodation.&lt;ref name="jestico" /&gt; The top floor also includes a roof terrace, which has 21 different grasses and wildflowers designed to attract urban bees and other species of pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Graphene Institute (NGI) {{!}} The University of Manchester|url = http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/collaborate/national-graphene-institute/|website = www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the building consists of a composite cladding, with an external stainless steel 'veil'.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt; The building faces on to [[Booth Street East]]. Construction started in March 2013, with the building being completed in 2015.&lt;ref name="UoMJan13" /&gt;

The building was designed by [[Jestico + Whiles]]. It cost around £30m, and was constructed by [[Bam Construct]]. The structural design was produced by [[Ramboll]]. Other shortlisted organisations are: [[Lend Lease Group|Lend Lease]], [[Laing O’Rourke]], [[Morgan Sindall]], [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]], and [[M&amp;W Group]]).&lt;ref name="BuildingMay13" /&gt; The design work was led by [[EC Harris]], along with [[CH2M Hill]] who provided specialist technical architecture design services for the cleanrooms and laboratories, together with Mechanical, Electrical and Process (MEP) consultant services.&lt;ref name="jesticopdf" /&gt;

=== History of the location ===
[[File:Excavations at the site of the National Graphene Institute 19.jpg|thumb|right|Excavations at the site of the Institute.]]
The Institute was constructed on the former site of the Albert Club, which was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] club that was located between Lawson Street and Clifford Street.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was established for the middle class [[Germans|German]] community that were involved in Manchester's [[cotton trade]], and [[Friedrich Engels]] frequented it during his time in the city, becoming a member in 1842.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="men2013" /&gt; The club was located on Clifford Street from 1842 prior to its relocation in 1859.&lt;ref name="engelsbook" /&gt; The building was constructed by the architect [[Jeptha Pacey]] as his personal house, and it was fronted by formal gardens. It was later converted into a private social club, which was named after [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. More recently it had been re-purposed as [[Turkish bath|Turkish]] [[Public bathing|public baths]],&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; and was later used as a hospital for women and children.&lt;ref name="museummeets" /&gt; The building was demolished in the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and the site was used for the construction of the Lamb Building.&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt;

The excavations that took place in February 2013 by [[Oxford Archaeology North]], prior to the construction of the Institute, uncovered the remnants of the club building along with a row of five cellars belonging to 1830s [[terraced housing]]. A sink removed from the site has been incorporated into the institute's new building.&lt;ref name="manchester2013" /&gt; As the main clean room of the new building will be located 3 metres below ground level,&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt; the remains of the Albert Club were not conserved.

The '''National Wildlife Health Center''' (NWHC) is a science center of the [[United States Geological Survey]]. NWHC is located in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], on a 24-acre plot of land that includes a main building and tight isolation building (TIB). The facility houses [[Biosafety level 3|Bio-safety Level 3]] (BSL-3) and [[Biosafety level 2|Bio-safety Level 2]] (BSL-2) laboratories on site.

The center studies several diseases that affect American [[wildlife]] including [[bat]] [[white nose syndrome]], [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD), [[avian influenza]], and [[sylvatic plague]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/ |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Disease Information |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the study of disease, NWHC has the capability to diagnose the causes of mass wildlife die-offs.  This is done via [[necropsy]] and the work of several [[pathologist]]s, [[biologists]], and other scientists.  The scientists are able to run [[toxicology]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] analyses to determine cause of death.  A notable instance of this capability in use was during the mass die-off of birds, primarily [[red-winged blackbird]]s, in [[Beebe, Arkansas]], on December 31, 2010. The NWHC determined the die-off to be the result of blunt trauma, most likely caused when the birds were frightened out of their nests at night by fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergquist |first=Lee |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/113018024.html |title=Madison lab solves mystery of Arkansas bird die-off |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honolulu Field Station ==
In addition to the main facility in Madison, Wisconsin, the NWHC maintains a field station in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]].  The Honolulu field station is responsible for researching diseases that effect Pacific Ocean wildlife, including birds, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/hfs/Projects.jsp |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Honolulu Projects |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally staff for the NWHC Honolulu field station numbers around four staff, either federal employees or contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/hfs/Staff.jsp |title=USGS National Wildlife Health Center - Honolulu Staff |publisher=Nwhc.usgs.gov |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">The [[Norway|Norwegian]] '''Institute of Marine Research''' ({{lang-no|Havforskningsinstituttet}}) is a national consultative research institute which is owned by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. The Institute performs research and provides advisory services in the fields of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. 

With a staff of almost 750, the Institute of Marine Research is the largest centre of marine research in Norway. The Institute has a highly qualified scientific staff, high-technology research stations and laboratories in [[Austevoll]], [[Bergen]] (head office), Flødevigen ([[Arendal]]) and [[Matre]], a department in [[Tromsø]] and several vessels.

The primary responsibility of the Institute of Marine Research is to provide advice to national authorities, society and industry regarding questions related to the ecosystems of the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and the Norwegian coastal zone and in the field of aquaculture. The Institute is heavily engaged in development aid activities through its [http://www.cdcf.no Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries].

Norwegian Fisheries Investigations ("Norske Fiskeriundersøgelser") was initiated in [[Oslo]] in 1864. In 1900 the investigations was located to Bergen, and in 1947, the institute was separated as a research institute under directorate of fisheries. To further ensure its independence, the institute became an independent institution in 1989.

Among important scientific contributions was [[Johan Hjort]]'s pivotal work on «Fluctuations in the Great Fisheries of Northern Europe» (1914). Einar Lea's use of [[ASDIC]] to find [[herring]] schools (1947) and the use of Echo Integration for estimating fish abundance (Midtun &amp; Hoff, 1962) are also notable.

The '''Office for Budget Responsibility''' ('''OBR''') is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] that the UK government established to provide independent [[economic forecast]]s and independent analysis of the public finances as background to the preparation of the [[United Kingdom budget|UK budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=Osborne to give details of £6bn spending cuts next week |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally created in May 2010 following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] (although it had previously been constituted in shadow form by the Conservative party opposition in December 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8401517.stm |title=Conservatives launch Office for Budget Responsibility |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed on a statutory footing by the [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]].&lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/892/made/data.pdf |title=The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a growing number of official independent fiscal watchdogs around the world.&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/ |title=What we do |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Chote]], formerly a director at the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11246225 | work=BBC News | title=Robert Chote to head Office for Budget Responsibility | date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current head.

==Functions==

The UK government created the OBR in 2010 with the purported goal of offering independent and authoritative analysis of the UK's public finances. To that end it produces two 5-year-ahead forecasts for the economy and the public finances each year, alongside the [[Budget Day|Budget]] and [[Autumn Statement]]s.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

In its role in providing independent analysis the OBR has four main duties:&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Forecasts of the economy and public finances===
The OBR produces five-year forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year. The forecasts accompany the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor’s]] [[Budget Day - United Kingdom|Budget Statement]] and his [[Autumn Statement]] and they incorporate the impact of any tax and spending measures announced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. Details of the forecasts are set out in the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) publications.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2014/ |title=Economic and fiscal outlook - March 2014 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Forecast evaluation report (FER) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/publications/forecast-evaluation-report/ |title=Forecast evaluation report - October 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published each autumn, examines how the EFO forecasts compare to subsequent outturns. The OBR has published briefing papers describing its approach to forecasting the economy &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Forecasting-the-economy.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 3: Forecasting the Economy |publisher=OBR |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public finances,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/briefing-paper-no-1-forecasting-the-public-finances/ |title=Briefing paper No. 1: Forecasting the public finances |publisher=OBR |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the macroeconomic model it uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Final_Model_Documentation.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 5: The macroeconomic model |publisher=OBR |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets===
The OBR uses its public finance forecasts to assess the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets. The Government has set itself two medium-term fiscal targets: first, a fiscal mandate to balance the cyclically-adjusted current budget five years ahead, and second, a supplementary target to have public sector net debt falling in 2015-16.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |title=Budget Forecast: June 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Economic and fiscal outlook, the OBR assesses whether the Government has a greater than 50 per cent probability of hitting these targets under current policy. Given the uncertainty inherent in all fiscal forecasts, the OBR also tests how robust this judgement is by using historical evidence, sensitivity analysis and alternative scenarios.

===Scrutiny of the Government’s policy costings===
The OBR conducts scrutiny and analysis of [[HM Treasury]]’s costing of tax and welfare spending measures. During the run-up to the Budget and the Autumn Statement, the OBR subjects the Government’s draft costings of tax and spending measures to detailed challenge and scrutiny. These are then stated in the EFO and the Treasury’s policy costing documents with the OBR stating whether it endorses the costings that the Government finally publishes as reasonable central estimates. The OBR has published a briefing paper describing its role in policy costings and how they fit into the forecast process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/27814-BriefingPaperNo_6.pdf |title=Briefing Paper No. 6: Policy costings and our forecasts |publisher=OBR |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assess the long-term sustainability of the public finances===
The OBR also assesses the long-term sustainability of the public finances. Its annual [[Fiscal sustainability]] report 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/fiscal-sustainability-report-july-2013/ |title=Fiscal sustainability report - July 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out long-term projections for different categories of spending, revenue and financial transactions and assesses whether they imply a sustainable path for public sector debt. The [[Fiscal sustainability]] report also analyses the health of the public sector’s balance sheet using both conventional National Accounts measures and the Whole of Government Accounts as prepared using commercial accounting principles.

===Other functions===
In addition to these core responsibilities, the Government has asked the OBR to forecast the Scottish receipts for the four taxes that it plans to devolve to the [[Scottish Government]] from 2015 onwards; the Scottish rate of income tax, stamp duty land tax, landfill tax and the aggregates levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/pdfs/ukpga_20120011_en.pdf |title=Scotland Act 2012|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OBR has published these forecasts since March 2012 alongside UK revenue forecasts. From autumn 2014, the OBR will publish similar forecasts for Welsh taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/294470/Wales_Bill_Command_Paper_-_English.pdf |title=Wales Bill: Financial Empowerment and Accountability |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Charter for Budget Responsibility was modified to include a new cap on welfare expenditure alongside the Government’s fiscal mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The welfare cap puts a limit on the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the years 2015/16 to 2018/19. The OBR is charged with assessing the Government’s performance against the cap at each [[Autumn Statement]]. As part of this assessment, the OBR is required to produce a forecast for welfare spending in scope of the cap in its Economic and fiscal outlook. The welfare cap means that if spending exceeds a certain limit, then policy action must be taken, or the cap level must change, and Parliamentary approval must be obtained. The cap features a two per cent forecast margin above the level of the cap that allows for small fluctuations in the forecast without corrective action being required. The OBR is required to assess whether welfare spending above the cap is caused by movements in the forecast or by discretionary policy changes. The OBR has also been tasked with producing an annual report on trends in welfare spending.

The OBR undertakes a variety of research projects through the year. It publishes briefing material &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/publications/briefing-papers/ |title=Briefing Papers |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inform the public about its work, and provides a same-day briefing on the public finances statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/topics/monthly-public-finance-data/ |title=Monthly public finance data |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budget Responsibility Committee &lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; members and OBR staff also give talks and presentations at external events. Robert Chote has discussed the role of the OBR, and the difference that it made after its first three years in existence, in a lecture entitled Britain’s fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel on 9 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Lecture_May-2013.pdf |title=Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel |author=Chote |date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities are summarised each year in its Annual Reports.

==History==
[[George Osborne]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the  [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], announced the body in his first official speech.  He criticised the economic and fiscal forecasts of the [[Premiership of Gordon Brown|previous Labour government]], and announced that the OBR would be responsible for publishing these independently of government in future.&lt;ref name=bbc-cutplan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=George Osborne promises spending cuts plan next week  |date=2010-05-17|work=BBC News|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective underpinning its creation was to provide an independent assessment of national public finances before the coalition Government's emergency budget in June 2010, which outlined the size and pace of the fiscal consolidation plan inherited from the outgoing administration.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The role of the Office is to advise whether the declared policy of the Government is likely to meet its targets &lt;ref name="mixedreactions"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/05/mixed-reaction-to-office-for-budget-responsibility/ | title= Mixed reaction to Office for Budget Responsibility | publisher= ''Public Finance'' | date= 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OBR was initially chaired by [[Sir Alan Budd]] who, along with Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker, formed the Budget Responsibility Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rt-hon-george-osborne-mp-on-the-obr-and-spending-announcements |title=Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on the OBR and spending announcements |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budd had been a founding member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|MPC]]; Dicks was chief economist at Novus Capital and former chief economist of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]; and Parker headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]’s public sector finances team. The remainder of the initial team comprised eight staff seconded from the Treasury.&lt;ref name="mixedreactions"/&gt; The initial team provided recommendations to the Chancellor on the role of the permanent OBR.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"/&gt;

The OBR produced its first forecast for public finances shortly before the June 2010 budget with the second at the June budget incorporating the impact of newly announced measures. [[Colin Talbot]], Chair of Public Policy and Management at [[Manchester Business School]] and Treasury adviser on public spending, questioned the credibility of the new organisation. He said that the body could not be set up in time to judge the forecasts in the [[June 2010 United Kingdom Budget]]. In his opinion, the OBR would not be sufficiently independent of politicians or the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] to remove the politics from economic decision-making.&lt;ref name=mixedreactions/&gt;   The office made adjustments to its forecasts in the week before the June 2010 budget.  These were thought to be politically favourable to the coalition government and so cast doubt on its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3e077ca-8adf-11df-bead-00144feab49a.html |title=Late OBR changes shrank job loss figure |author=Chris Giles |journal=Financial Times |date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 it was announced that Budd would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7873605/Sir-Alan-Budd-to-leave-the-Office-for-Budget-Responsibility.html Sir Alan Budd to leave the Office for Budget Responsibility], ''Daily Telegraph'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/alan-budd-quits-government-spending-watchdog Alan Budd quits as government spending watchdog], ''Guardian'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported "His departure was expected and Sir Alan had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period. His contract spanned the emergency Budget, leaving enough time thereafter to advise on the legislation needed to establish the OBR on a permanent basis."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65ccae4c-88c8-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation on his successor had included [[Rachel Lomax]], [[John Gieve]], [[Andrew Dilnot]], [[Robert Chote]], [[Michael Scholar]] and [[Ruth Lea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100046401/how-about-sir-michael-scholar-for-the-obr/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=How about Sir Michael Scholar for the OBR? | date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/iainmartin/2010/07/06/ruth-lea-in-at-the-obr-pdq/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Ruth Lea in at the OBR PDQ? | first=Iain | last=Martin | date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Chancellor George Osborne announced that [[Robert Chote]] had been appointed as the new Chairman of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). The two other members of the BRC were Stephen Nickell, a former member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee]] and Graham Parker, who formerly  headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury's]] public sector finances team.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; An Oversight Board was also created comprising the three BRC members plus two external members acting as non-Executive Directors.

==Governance==

===Budget Responsibility Committee===

The three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC) who are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer following an appointment hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, lead the OBR. They have executive responsibility for carrying out the core functions of the OBR, including responsibility for the judgements reached in its forecasts. They are: [[Robert Chote]] (Chairman), [[Charlie Bean|Professor Sir Charles Bean]], Graham Parker CBE.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Oversight Board===

The OBR's Oversight Board ensures that effective arrangements are in place to provide assurance on risk management, governance and internal control. It consists of the three members of the BRC plus two non-executive members, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] and [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Sir Christopher Kelly]].&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Advisory Panel===

The OBR’s Advisory Panel of economic and fiscal experts meets regularly to advise the OBR on its work programme and analytical methods. Currently members come from the [[Bank of England]], the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], academia, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=OBR names expert advisory panel |publisher=OBR |date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and related material==
The OBR’s formal rights and responsibilities are outlined in four documents:

•	The [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]] &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt;

•	The Charter for Budget Responsibility &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=HM Treasury |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	The OBR/HM Treasury Framework document &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_framework040411.pdf |title=Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury Framework Document |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	A Memorandum of Understanding between the OBR and government departments with which it interacts most frequently and closely: HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_memorandum040411.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between Office for Budget Responsibility, HM Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp; Customs |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt; sets out the overarching duty of the OBR to examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances.  It also gives complete discretion to the OBR in the performance of its duties, as long as those duties are performed objectively, transparently and independently and takes into account the sitting government’s policies and not alternative policies. 
The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; outlines the OBR’s independence which includes complete discretion to decide:

•	The methodology underpinning the OBR’s forecasts, assessment and analyses;

•	The judgements made by the OBR in producing these outputs;

•	The content of the OBR’s publications; and

•	The OBR’s work programme of research and additional analysis.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; also specifies material that the OBR have to include in its forecasts and gives the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] the right to determine the length of the forecast horizon – subject to a minimum of five years. The Charter states that the Government remains responsible for policy decisions and costings and the OBR “should fnot provide normative commentary on the particular merits of Government policies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter for Budget Responsibility March 2014 update, page 12, para 4.12 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives the OBR right of access to all Government information which it may reasonably require for the performance of its duties. Under the Memorandum of Understanding where it is not possible to reach agreement, issues may be escalated to the Chair of the OBR and the Permanent Secretaries as appropriate.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The Framework document sets out the OBR’s governance and management arrangements.
As a non-departmental body under the aegis of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the OBR is formally accountable to the [[Treasury Select Committee]] of the House of Commons. This accountability to parliament takes a number of elements:

First the four core publications the OBR is required to publish each year have to be laid formally before parliament;

Second, the [[Treasury Select Committee]] can call on the OBR to give evidence on its work at any time;

Third, the Treasury Select Committee has a role in determining the membership of the Budget Responsibility Committee. When a new member has to be appointed, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] names his preferred candidate following a formal application and interview process run by the civil service. The [[Treasury Select Committee]] holds confirmation hearings with the candidate and can veto the Chancellor’s choice.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

== International coordination ==
The OBR is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6395">The '''Ortega hypothesis''' holds that average or mediocre [[scientists]] contribute substantially to the advancement of [[science]].&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

== Citation research ==
The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; but a number of systematic studies of scientific [[citations]] have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after [[Isaac Newton]]'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and criminology.&lt;ref name=Oromaner/&gt;

The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.&lt;ref name=MacRoberts/&gt; Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.&lt;ref name=Kretschmer/&gt; Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.&lt;ref name=Hoerman/&gt; Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;&lt;ref name=eponym/&gt; Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;

== The name ==
The name of the hypothesis refers to [[José Ortega y Gasset]], who wrote in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.&lt;ref name=Ortega/&gt; Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific [[geniuses]] create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that [[Albert Einstein]] drew upon the ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Ernst Mach]] to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

The '''Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences''' (PIMS) is a mathematical [[institute]] created in 1996 by universities in [[Western Canada]] and the [[Northwestern United States]] to promote research and excellence in all areas of the [[mathematical sciences]]. It provides training and support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers hosted at member institutions. It also supports visiting researchers and hosts events ranging from individual lectures to multi-year "collaborative research groups (CRGs)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/focus-periods PIMS focus periods] pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mathematical sciences. Additionally, PIMS has a large educational outreach program aimed at promoting mathematics at all levels but with particular focus on primary and secondary levels ([[K–12 (education)|K–12]]).

== Structure ==
PIMS has a distributed structure. Its central offices are located on the campus of the [[University of British Columbia]]. The members of the institute are:
* 9 full members: [[University of British Columbia]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Regina]], [[University of Victoria]], [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[Simon Fraser University]], [[University of Washington]], [[University of Lethbridge]], and [[University of Manitoba]].
* 2 affiliate members: [[University of Portland]] and [[University of Northern British Columbia]].
PIMS receives funding from [[NSERC]] and provincial governments. In 2007, the institute became a ''Unité Mixte Internationale'' of the French [[CNRS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/insmi/spip.php?article23|title=L’Unité Mixte Internationale 3069 au Canada : PIMS|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cnrs.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pims.math.ca/pims-glance/collaborations-partnerships|title=Collaborations - Partnerships {{!}} Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences - PIMS|website=www.pims.math.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Research program ==
Research at PIMS includes both hosting of events and support for personnel. Post-doctoral researchers, visitors and graduate students supported by PIMS are hosted at one of the sites for the duration of their stay. The event programs include individual lectures, seminar series and scientific meetings. An international scientific review panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/pims-glance/scientific-review-panel PIMS Scientific Review Panel]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adjudicates event applications and decides on the scientific programs. Longer term projects are supported as Collaborative Research Groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/collaborative-research-groups PIMS Collaborative Research Groups]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which will typically include a series of thematic activities such as summer schools and workshops, as well as postdoctoral fellow. PIMS also supports an International Graduate Training Centre (IGTC) which is focused on Mathematical Biology.

== Education and outreach ==
PIMS is involved in all levels of mathematical education from Elementary School onwards. In [[British Columbia]], PIMS organizes the Elementary Math Contest (Elmacon),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmacon.org  Elementary Math Contest Website]. elmacon.org. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an annual competition open to grades 5, 6 and 7. Math Mania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/math-mania  PIMS Math Mania]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is directed at high school students and uses interactive games and demonstrations to introduce students to mathematical concepts. PIMS also runs teacher workshops in many rural areas and conferences. For example, the annual 'Changing the Culture' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/changing-culture  Changing the Culture]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference which brings together teachers and educators to discuss issues and new developments relating mathematics education. Outreach to Aboriginal and First Nations students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pims.math.ca/educational/aboriginal-outreach-newsletter PIMS Aboriginal/First Nations outreach programs]. pims.math.ca. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also a strong focus for the BC and Saskatchewan sites, with annual summer camps, programs and resources aimed at providing increased learning opportunities for those students, for example the [http://aboriginalperspectives.uregina.ca/introduction.shtml Aboriginal Perspectives] website established in 2009.

=== mathtube.org ===
In October 2011, PIMS launched a new multimedia site, [http://www.mathtube.org mathtube.org]. This site includes lecture videos, slides and notes from significant PIMS lectures from the past decade, as well as recent events. The site was created to meet the increasing demand to see lecture content online. The site features notable speakers such as [[Edward Witten]], [[Ram Murty]], [[Dusa McDuff]] and [[George C. Papanicolaou|George Papanicolaou]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stanford.edu/~papanico/  George Papanicolaou's personal website]. stanford.edu. {{Retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is updated regularly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">[[Image:Piazzetta telematica for journalists -Italia90 - Roma.JPG|thumb|Piazzetta telematica "Italia '90" for journalists — Roma 1990.]]

In the fields of [[urban planning]], [[urban regeneration]] and [[e-government]], the term '''''piazza telematica''''' has been used in Italy since the early 1990s by a number of [[community network]] and local institutions for promoting the insertion, inside the urban upgrading processes, of the principles of [[sustainable development]] and of [[accessibility]] for all to [[Information technology|IT]] tools for assuring the Right of [[Citizenship]]: the possibilities to participate in public decision processes, to access to the knowledge and training, to take part of the social [[local community]] life.

The term piazza telematica evokes a hybrid space indebted in equal parts to the real (with territorial components) and the [[Virtuality|virtual]] space that has to be considered as a whole, a new [[glocal]] (global – local) [[public space]] with a great symbolic value for the [[democracy|democratic]] interaction and for the social life.

The word “[[piazza]]” underlines the semantic significance of a [[public space]] traditionally located in the heart of  the [[town]] centre or of  a [[village]] and dedicated to [[communication]], [[meeting]], and the exchange of material goods and, at present, through the use of telematics systems and services, to the exchange also of immaterial goods (new virtual services and functions: [[Telecommuting]], [[Coworking]], online [[Training]] through [[Multi-monitor]], [[Telemedicine]], [[Electronic commerce]] and the new [[Sustainable mobility]] services such as [[Bike sharing]] and [[Car sharing]].

== History ==
*1990 - The term Piazza Telematica is used for the first time in newspapers and magazines in order to describe the telematics systems and services set up for the journalists in the 12 Italian cities hosting the [[FIFA World Cup 1990]].
*1994 - Participation to the ACT-VILL project of the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] for the city of the 21st century corresponding to new concepts synthesised in three scenarios:
**[[Sustainable city]], a city that internalise the problems it generates, solving them instead of transferring to other or to the future. 
**"[[Glocal]]" city (global/local), a city with a better balance between the [[globalisation]] process and the ability to use local resources. 
**Post-modern or [[agora]] city, a human centred city with a harmonic relationship between the [[citizen]] and the [[urban design]].
*1995 - Participation to the European conference ''Urban utopias: new tools for the [[European Urban Renaissance]], promoted by the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] and hosted by the Municipality of [[Berlin]].
*2004 - The first pilot project of a Piazza Telematica, supported by the European Union (div. XVI for social cohesion and sustainable development) is opened to the general public in [[Naples]] (Italy) in the bourough of Scampia.

In some other pilot projects, as is the case for the Piazza Telematica of the Municipality of Provaglio d'Iseo, the term Piazza Telematica is used in order to evoke a virtual space on the Internet open to all citizens for the exchange of ideas, proposals and participation, through [[Internet forum|forum]] and other [[World Wide Web|web]] instruments, to the socio-cultural and economic life of the [[community]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9045">'''Project engineering''' includes all parts of the design of manufacturing or processing facilities, either new or modifications to and expansions of existing facilities.  A "project" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers, designers, [[drafter]]s and others from one or more engineering disciplines or departments.  Project tasks consist of such things as performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and preparing various lists, such as equipment and materials lists, and creating drawings such as electrical, [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s, physical layouts and other drawings used in design and construction. A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a [[project manager]] or management team.  Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to engineering companies.  Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed.

==Overview==

===Responsibilities===
The role of the project engineer can often be described as that of a liaison between the project manager and the technical disciplines involved in a project. The distribution of "liasing" and performing tasks within the technical disciplines can vary wildly from project-to-project.  This often depends on the type of product, it's maturity, and the size of the company, to name a few.  It is important for a Project Engineer to understand that balance.  The Project Engineer should be knowledgeable enough to be able to speak intelligently within the various disciplines, and not purely be a liaison -- such project engineers who only "liaise" can more accurately be characterized as "lazy".  The project engineer is also often the primary technical point of contact for the consumer.

A project engineer's responsibilities include schedule preparation, pre-planning and resource forecasting for engineering and other technical activities relating to the project. They may also be in charge of performance management of [[vendor]]s. They assure the accuracy of financial forecasts, which tie-in to project schedules.  They ensure projects are completed according to project plans. Project engineers manage project team resources and training and develop extensive project management experience and expertise. 

When project teams are structured so that multiple specialty disciplines report to the project engineer, then two important responsibilities of the project engineer are inter-discipline coordination and overall quality control of the work.&lt;ref name=Herbst&gt;{{cite conference |last=Herbst |first=Andrew |author2=Hans Verwijs |title=Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control |book-title=Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management |date=Oct 19–22, 2011 |volume=1 |isbn=9781618393616 |pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering companies===
When used, an engineering company is generally contracted to design a project to achieve some specific objective, ranging in scope from simple modifications to new factories or expansions costing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.  The client usually provides the engineering company with a scoping document listing the details of the objective in terms of such things as production rate and product specifications and general to specific information about processes and equipment to be used and the expected deliverables, such as calculations, drawings, lists, specifications, schedules, etc. The client is typically involved in the entire design process and makes decisions throughout, including the technology, type of equipment to use, bid evaluation and supplier selection, the layout of equipment and operational considerations.  Depending on the project the engineering company may perform material and energy balances to size equipment and to quantify inputs of materials and energy (steam, electric power, fuel). This information is used to write specifications for the equipment.  The equipment specifications are sent out for bids.  The client, the engineering company or both select the equipment.  The equipment suppliers provide drawings of the equipment, which are used by the engineering company's mechanical engineers, designers and [[drafter]]s to make general arrangement drawings, which show how the pieces of equipment are located in relation to other equipment. Layout drawings show specific information about the equipment, electric motors powering the equipment and such things as auxiliary equipment (pumps, fans, air compressors), piping and buildings. The engineering company maintains an equipment list with major equipment, auxiliary equipment, motors, etc. Electrical engineers are involved with power supply to motors and equipment.  Process engineers perform material and energy balances and design the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s to show how equipment is supplied with process fluids, water, air, gases, etc. and the type of control loops used.   The instrumentation and controls engineers specify the instrumentation and controls and handle any computer controls and control rooms.  Civil and structural engineers deal with site layout and engineering and structural concerns like foundations, pads, structures, supports and bracing for equipment.  Environmental engineers deal with any air emissions and treatment of liquid effluent.

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that projects engineers are involved with include:

*[[Work breakdown structure]]: a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components
*[[Gantt chart]]:  type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule
*[[Critical Path Analysis]]: an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]]: a statistical tool which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project
*[[Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique]]: network analysis technique that allows probabilistic treatment both network logic and estimation of activity duration
*[[Petri Nets]]: one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems

==Construction industry==
Project engineers are often project managers with qualifications in engineering or [[construction management]]. Other titles include field engineer, [[Construction engineering|construction engineer]], or construction project engineer. In smaller projects, this person may also be responsible for contracts and will be called an assistant project manager. A similar role is undertaken by a client's engineer or [[owner's engineer]], but by inference, these often act more in the interests of the commissioning company.

Project engineers do not necessarily do [[Design engineer|design]] work, but instead represent the contractor or client out in the field, help [[tradesman|tradespeople]] interpret the job's designs, ensure the job is constructed according to the project plans, and assist [[Cost engineering|project controls]], including budgeting, scheduling, and planning. In some cases a project engineer is responsible for assisting the assigned project manager with regard to design and a project and with the execution of one or more simultaneous projects in accordance with a valid, executed contract, per company policies and procedures and work instructions for customized and standardized plants.

Typical responsibilities may include: daily operations of field work activities and organization of [[subcontractor]]s; coordination of the implementation of a project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for [[tradesmen]]; review of engineering deliverables; redlining drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; bill of materials creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.

'''Scepticism in law''' is a school of [[jurisprudence]] that was a reaction against the idea of [[natural law]], and a response to the '[[Legal formalism|formalism]]' of [[legal positivism|legal positivists]]. Legal scepticism  is sometimes known as [[legal realism]].&lt;ref&gt;In the context of [[philosophy]], some people prefer the word '[[scepticism]]’ to 'realism'  because the word 'realism' is also used for school of thought founded by [[Plato]] and his followers. The reason for this preference for the use of word 'scepticism' is not only that this word is used in the writings of sceptic jurists themselves, but also that this word is suitable in the context of history of philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Posner, "The skeptical vein in American thinking about law runs from Holmes to the legal realists to the critical legal studies movement, while behind Holmes stretches a European skeptical legal tradition that runs from [[Thrasymachus]] (in Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]) to Hobbes and Bentham and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==

Scepticism is a [[philosophy| philosophical]] approach that includes a scientific method and a rejection of unevidenced claims to certainty. Scepticism has been known in various degrees. [[Pyrrho]] was the first philosopher who developed it to a high degree. Greek [[Sophist]] were also sceptics. [[Protagoras]] was a famous Greek Sophist. Greek Sophists were also law teachers.

Writing about the courts of Athenian democracy, [[Bertrand Russell]] states: "In general, there were a large number of judges to hear each case. The plaintiff and defendant, or prosecutor and accused, appeared in person, not through professional lawyers. Naturally, success or failure depended largely on oratorical skill in appealing to popular prejudices. Although a man had to deliver his own speech, he could hire an expert to write a speech for him, or, as many preferred, he could pay for instruction in the arts required for success in the law courts. These arts the Sophists were supposed to teach".&lt;ref&gt;History of Western Philosophy, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf writes about Sophists as, "It was their skepticism and relativism that made them suspect. No one would have criticized them for training lawyers, as they did, to be able to argue either side of a case" Philosophy, History &amp; Problems, p.&amp;nbsp;30. American legal sceptics are influenced by '[[pragmatism]]' of [[William James]], Dr. John Dewey, and F.e.S. Schiller.

Bertrand Russell declares that William James's doctrine is "an attempt to build a superstructure of belief upon a foundation of scepticism". One of the three founders of pragmatism, Schiller, considered himself a disciple of Protagoras. See &lt;ref&gt;Russell's History of Western Philosophy, p.94 and p.772.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the reasons for the preference of some people for the word 'scepticism'.

==Early history==

[[Mickey Dias]] writes: "a preliminary warning is needed against the tendency to imagine that there is anything like a 'school' of American realists. A difficulty in the way of a coherent presentation of their views is that there are varying versions of realism as well as changes of front; positions formerly defended with zest have since been forgotten or abandoned……. Judge Jerome Frank (1889–1957), a leading exponent preferred the phrases 'experimentalists' or 'constructive skeptics', He repudiated the charge that 'the realist school embraced fantastically inconsistent ideas' by pointing out that 'actually no such school existed'. The common bond is, in his words&lt;ref&gt;Law and the Modem Mind (first English edition, 1949), Preface, pp. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt;
,'skepticism as to some of the conventional legal theories, a skepticism stimulated by a zeal to reform, in the interests of justice, some court-house ways. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
With such zeal to reform, legal sceptics made a revolt against the formalism.

Lord Lloyd of Hamstead has described this revolt in a wider philosophical perspective as follows:

"In the nineteenth and at the beginning of the present century, laissez-faire was the dominant creed in America. This creed was associated, in the intellectual sphere, with a certain attachment to what has been called "formalism" in philosophy and the social sciences. This was marked by a reverence for the role of logic and mathematics and a priori reasoning as applied to philosophy, economics and jurisprudence, with but little urge to link these empirically to the facts of life. Yet empirical science and technology were increasing dominating American society and with this development arose and intellectual movement in favor of treating philosophy and the social sciences, and even logic itself, as empirical studies not rooted in abstract formalism. In America this movement was associated with such figures as William James and Dewey in philosophy and logic. Veblen in economics, Beard and Robinson in historical studies, and Mr. Justice Holmes in [[jurisprudence]]. It is important to note that this movement was especially hostile to the so-called British empirical school derived from Hume, and to which [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Austin]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] adhered. For while it is true that these thinkers were positivist and anti-metaphysical they were for the anti-formalists, not empirical enough, since they were associated with a priori reasoning not based on actual study of the facts, such as Mill's formal logic and his reliance on an abstract "economic man," Bentham's hedonic calculus of pleasures and pains, and the analytical approach to jurisprudence derived from Austin. They were particularly critical of the ahistorical approach of the English utilitarians. Nor, unlike the sociologists of Pound persuasion, were they interested to borrow from Bentham such abstract analyses of society as his doctrine of conflicting to emphasise was the need to enlarge knowledge empirically, and to relate it to the solution of the practical problems of man in society at the present day., &lt;ref&gt;Lord Lloyd of Hamstead, Jurisprudence, 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new movement in jurisprudence found philosophical support of '[[Pragmatism]]'. The principal exponent of 'Pragmatism', William James, writes: "A pragmatist turns away from abstraction and insufficiencies, from verbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns towards completeness and adequacy, towards facts, towards actions, towards powers.,,&lt;ref&gt;James, Pragmatism, (1925), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.==
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]]]
This sceptical approach impressed Justice Holmes, who laid the foundation of healthy and constructive scepticism in the law. Hughes writes: "Though another half century was to elapse before the appearance of Ogden and Richard's The Meaning of Meaning, exploration of meaning of meaning of law was Holmes's pioneer enterprise.,,&lt;ref&gt;Charles. Hughes, "Early Writing of Holmes, Jr.", in 44&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes further writes: " To me, Mr. Justice Holmes is a prophet of the Law,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law Review (1930-31), at p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] was graduated from Harvard Law School in 1866, and opened a private law practice. He devoted most of his energies to legal scholarship. From 1870 to 1873 he served as editor of the American Law Review and taught constitutional law at Harvard.

In 1881, Holmes published ''The Common Law'', representing a new departure in legal philosophy. He changed the attitude of the law through his writings. The opening sentence captures the pragmatic theme of that work and of Holmes's philosophy of law: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. " As a justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. was well known for the eloquence, pungency, and abundance of his dissenting opinions––so much so that he was called the "Great Dissenter." Holmes was appointed justice in 1902, and served the Court for thirty years. At that time, many state regulatory laws were being declared unconstitutional because the Court felt they did not conform to its concept of due process of law.

In a dissenting opinion in ''Lochner v. New York'' (1905)&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"&gt;198 U.S. 45,76 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes declared that the law should develop along with society and that the 14th Amendment did not deny states a right to experiment with social legislation. He also argued for judicial restraint, asserting that the Court should not interpret the Constitution according to its own social philosophy. Speaking for a unanimous Court in ''Schenck v. United States'' (1919), however, he stated that judicial review was necessary in cases involving Freedom and Speech and presented the "clear and present danger" doctrine associated with his name. Francis Biddle writes: ''He was convinced that one who administers constitutional law should multiply his skepticisms to avoid heading into vague words like liberty, and reading into law his private convictions or the prejudices of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural law, and the Supreme Court, (1960), p.lO. Biddle also tells usthat Holmes ,"refused to let his preferences (other men were apt to call them convictions) interfere with his judicial decisions……	The steadily held determination to keep his own vies isolated from his professional work is aptly shown by his famous remark in the Lochner case-the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statistics….	A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory." P.IO. It is importantto note that eighty years after Lochner case (1905), Human Right Commission of Pakistan recommended that, "the confusion caused by conflict between normal Iaws and belief  which does not enjoy the force of law) needs to be removed." See, State of Human Rights in 1996, at p. 46, Human Right Commission of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Holmes, 'men make their own laws; that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that judges are not independent mouthpieces of the infinite.,&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural Law and the Supreme Court, (1960) p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; 'The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky'.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Pac. Co. V. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (dissent).&lt;/ref&gt; Law should be viewed 'from the stance of the bad man'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"&gt;Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harvard Law Review (1897) 457&lt;/ref&gt;
'The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; A judge must be aware of social facts. Only a judge or lawyer who is acquainted with the historical, social, and economic aspects of the law will be in a position to fulfill his functions properly.

As a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Holmes introduced a new method of constitutional interpretation. He challenged the traditional concept of constitution. Holmes also protested against the method of abstract logical deduction from general rules in the judicial process. According to Holmes, lawyers and judges are not logicians and mathematicians. The books of the laws are not books of logic and mathematics. He writes: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, and even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed.

The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics., &lt;ref&gt;Holmes, The Common Law,1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Lochner v. New York''&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"/&gt; he observes that, 'General propositions do not decide concrete cases."

Holmes, also insisted on the separation of 'ought' and 'is' which are obstacles in understanding the realities of the law. As an ethical sceptic, Holmes tells us that if you want to know the real law, and nothing else, you must consider it from the point of view of 'bad man' who cares only from material consequences of the courts' decisions, and not from the point of view of good man, who find his reasons for conduct "in the vaguer sanctions of his conscience.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and talks about rights and duties, malice, intent, and negligence- and nothing is easier in legal reasoning than to take these words in their moral sense.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Biddle. Justice Holmes, Natural Law, and the Supreme Court. 40 332 p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes said: "I think our morally tinted words have caused a great deal of confused thinking. But Holmes is not unconcerned with moral question. He writes: "The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt;

==Jerome Frank==

[[Jerome New Frank]] followed Holmes scepticism, and made an elaborate system of legal scepticism. He considered himself to be 'a constructive sceptic'. He challenged the traditional conception that law consists of rules from which deductions are made. He called that conception a 'basic myth of law'. He argued that it is fruitless to seek such certainty, that the law is uncertain and that the law cannot be separated from decisions of the courts.

Frank argues that every legal controversy is unique and may not be decided by rigid universals and abstract generalizations. He calls those jurists who find legal uncertainty within the laws's formal rules 'Rule-sceptics', and those who find legal uncertainty arising from the nature of facts 'Fact-sceptics'. Dias writes: "Frank divided realists into two camps, described as 'rule skeptics' and 'fact skeptic'. The 'rule skeptics' rejected legal rules as providing uniformity in law, and tried instead to find uniformity in rules evolved out of psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, politics, etc. [[Hans Kelsen]], it will be remembered, maintained that it is not possible to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. The 'rule skeptics' avoided that criticism by saying that they were not deriving purposive 'oughts', but only predictions of judicial behaviour analogous to the laws of science. Frank called this brand realism the left-wing adherents of a right-wing traditions, namely, the tradition of trying to find uniformity in rules. They, too, had to account for uncertainty in the law on the basis of rule-uncertainty. The 'fact skeptics', among them Frank, rejected even this aspiration towards uniformity. So he abandoned all attempts to seek rule-certainty and pointed to the uncertainty of establishing even the facts in trial courts. These have to be established largely by witnesses, who are fallible and who may be lying. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty how fallible a particular witness is likely to be, or how persuasively he will lie. All persons, judges and jurymen alike, form different impressions of the dramas unfolded before them; an inflexion or a cough may awaken subconscious predilections, varied idiosyncrasies and prejudices. Eternal verities are not to be erected on such a basis. Frank alleged that all those who write on [[legal certainty]], not excepting the 'rule skeptics', over look these difficulty. 'They often call their writings 'jurisprudence'; but as they almost never consider juries and jury-trials, one might chide them for forgetting jurisprudence. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, p.624. see also, Law and the Modem Mind (1930), Preface, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
"For any particular lay person", Frank writes: "the law, with respect to any particular set of facts, is a decision of a court with respect to those facts so far as that decision affects that particular person. Until a court has passed on those facts no law on that subject is yet in existence. ,&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Law and the Modem Mind'' (1930), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Frankfurter, who wrote book "Mr. Justice Holmes and the Supreme Court" published three years after the death of Holmes, observes in ''Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. V. Browning''&lt;ref&gt;310 U.S. 362, 369 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; that: "It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of 'laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it."

Statutes and constitutions are inanimate object which cannot speak by themselves. [[John Chipman Gray]], the great American Jurist, who reiterated Holmes's view, writes: "Statutes do not interpret themselves; their meaning is declared by the courts, and it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and with no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as law. ,&lt;ref&gt;Jhon Chipman Gray, The Nature and Sources of the Law. (1909), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He further writes: "It has been sometime said that the Law is composed of two parts,-legislative law and judge-made law, but, in truth all the Law is judge-made law. The shape in which a statute is imposed on the community as a guide for conduct is that statute as interpreted by the courts. The courts put life into the dead words of the statute. 339 To quote from Bishop Hoadly.......'Nay, whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is He who is truly the law Giver to all intents and purposes, and not who first who wrote and spoke them”.

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate."&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | contribution = Executive Summary | editor-last = APA Task Force | editor-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = Jochen | last2 = Valkenburg | first2 = Patti M. | title = Adolescents' exposure to a sexualized media environment and their notions of women as sex objects | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–384 | date = March 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9176-y | ref = harv }} [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9176-y.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Media Education Foundation's, ''[[Killing Us Softly|Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women]]'', the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne &gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Jean Kilbourne]] (writer/presenter), [[Sut Jhally]] (director) and David Rabinovitz | date= 2010 | accessdate= 30 December 2015 | title= Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women | medium= Video | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2507550/ | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] | location = Northampton, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers? Media &amp; maternal influences on young girls' self-sexualization | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 67 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 463–476 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-012-0183-x | date = October 2012 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232686658 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization.

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people.

This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt; The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical "media-engendered" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain "upward mobility" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt;

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]]. Here, the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem, but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attenborough | first1 = Frederick T. | author-link1 = Frederick T.

the emergence of new forms of sexual experience, for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology;

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

The '''shorthand for the orchestration''' of a classical [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] (and other similar ensembles), or Orchestra Instrumentation Numerical Notation, is used to outline which and how many [[musical instrument|instruments]], especially [[wind instrument]]s, are called for in a given piece of music. The shorthand is ordered in the same fashion as the parts of the individual instruments in the [[sheet music#Full scores, variants and condensations|score]], read from top to bottom.

==General approach==

The orchestra is divided into four groups and specified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://desatheory.janetpeachey.com/Orchestral%20Instruments.html The Order of Instruments in an Orchestral Score, Music Theory Website at Duke Ellington School of the Arts] Accessed 27 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Woodwind instrument]]s: [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s
* [[Brass instrument]]s: [[French horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]s
* [[Timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[harp]], [[piano]] etc.
* [[String section]]: [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[Double bass|basses]], frequently abbreviated to 'str', 'strs' or similar.

: The relations of the individual sections within the strings has been kept since the classical period for acoustical reasons, so a small string section could be 10/8/6/5/4; an example is given for a much larger orchestra in the table below.

If any soloists or a choir are called for, their parts are usually printed between the percussion/keyboards and the strings in the score. In shorthand however, they are usually omitted.

==Degree of standardisation==

The basic order of the instruments, as seen above, is common to all of the shorthand systems. However, there is no standardized version of this shorthand; different publishers and librarians use different systems, especially for doubling/alternate/additional instruments. David Daniels, in earlier versions of his seminal work gathering in print a catalogue of the orchestrations of some 4,000+ pieces,&lt;ref&gt;David Daniels: Orchestral Music A Handbook, Pub. (USA) Scarecrow Press, Inc, Lanham, Maryland, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8108-3228-3}} (3rd Ed.), cf. 2nd Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-1484-6}} and 1st Ed. {{ISBN|0-8108-0537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; made use of a shorthand for doubling/alternate/additional instruments which was less clear, but in the newer online version&lt;ref&gt;[https://daniels-orchestral.com/about/this-online-tool/ Description of the online tool at daniels-orchestral.com] Retrieved 18 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Daniels' approach has been refined to something more explicit, akin to the Chester Novello and Boosey &amp; Hawkes notations below.

Examples for different notations for the same orchestration:
{| class = "table"

'''Stress in medical students''' is [[Stress (biology)|stress]] caused by strenuous medical programs, which may have physical and psychological effects on the well-being of medical students. Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral [[symptomatology]]. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress.

==Causes==
Stress is defined as an imbalance between environmental conditions necessary for survival and the ability of individuals to adapt to those conditions. Stress in medical students has been recognized for a long time. Many studies have explored the causes, consequences and solutions. There are three issues considered to be the most relevant, in terms of stress development in medical students. They are required to learn a great deal of new information in a short period of time before taking exams and evaluations. Therefore, they have little to no time to review what they have learned.&lt;ref name=Yusoff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yussof |first1=M |last2=Baba |first2=A |year=2013 |title= Prevalence and associated factors of stress, anxiety and depression among prospective medical students|journal= Asian Journal of Psychiatry |volume= 6|issue=2 |pages=128–133|pmid=23466109 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2012.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students are overloaded with a tremendous amount of information. They have a limited amount of time to memorize all the information studied. The overload of information creates a feeling of disappointment because of the inability to handle all the information at once and succeed during the examination period. Many medical students struggle with their own capacity to meet the demands of medical curriculum.&lt;ref name=Yusoff/&gt;

Stress responses to different situations vary at different [[levels of consciousness]], [[psychological stress]], and [[physiological stress]]. These points of stress may be interrelated, and each may be at a different level.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=VanDulmen |first1=S |last2=Trompb |first2=F |year=2007 |title= The impact of assessing simulated bad news consultations on medical students stress response and communication performance |journal= Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=943–950 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2007.06.016|pmid=17689196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people believe that the most stressful period of a medical student's academic career is the gap between graduation from medical school and being board eligible in a medical specialty. The Resident Service Committee of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) divided the common stressors of residency into three categories: situational, personal, and professional.&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ray |first1=I |last2=Joseph |first2=D |year=2010 |title= Stress in medical students |journal=JK Science |volume=12|issue=4 |pages=163–164 |url=http://www.jkscience.org/archive/volume124/Stress%20in%20Medical%20Students.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situational stressors include inordinate hours, [[sleep deprivation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waqas|first1=Ahmed|title=Association of academic stress with sleeping difficulties in medical students of a Pakistani medical school: a cross sectional survey|journal=PeerJ|date=2015|volume=3|pages=e840|doi=10.7717/peerj.840|pmid=25802809|url=https://peerj.com/articles/840/|pmc=4369327}}&lt;/ref&gt; excessive workload, overbearing clerical and administrative responsibilities, inadequate support from allied health professionals, a large number of difficult patients, and conditions for learning that are less than optimal.&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt;  Second year students experience other stress situations because they start to interact with the patients. These interactions include stressful situations, like the delivery of bad news.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt;

Personal stressors include family, friend and relationship issues. Financial issues are common, as many residents carry heavy educational debts, and they feel compelled to hold a secondary job in order to repay their debts. Isolation is frequently exacerbated by relocation away from family and friends. Other stressors include limited free time to relax or develop new support systems, psycho-social concerns brought by the stress of residency, and inadequate coping skills. Professional stressors include responsibility for patient care, supervision of more junior residents and students, difficult patients, information overload and career planning.&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt;

==Effects==
Excessive amounts of stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts, [[sleeping disorders]], decreased attention, reduced concentration, temptation to cheat on exams, depression, loss of objectivity, increased incidence of errors, and improper behavior such as negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khan, Rida|author2=Lin, Jamie S.|author3=Mata, Douglas A.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0643|title=Addressing Depression and Suicide Among Physician Trainees|date=1 August 2015|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=72|issue=8|page=848|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0643|pmid=26107398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, stress in medical students can break the stability of the student's health and result in illness. This can cause headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, coronary heart disease, impaired judgments, absenteeism, self-medication, and the consumption of drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name=ORourke&gt;{{cite journal |last1= O'Rourke |first1=M |last2=Hammond |first2=S |year=2010 |title= The Medical Student Stress Profile: a tool for stress audit in medical training.  |journal=Medical Education |volume=27 |issue=44 |pages=1027–1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that these risks continue throughout training, also affecting resident physicians in addition to medical students, particularly with regard to depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotenstein|first=Lisa S.|last2=Ramos|first2=Marco A.|last3=Torre|first3=Matthew|last4=Segal|first4=J.

A recent study among German medical students at international universities displayed the significantly higher risk of depression symptoms being 2.4 times higher than the average population. 23.5% of these German medical students showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Kamiar-K. Rueckert|year=2016|title=Depression and Quality of Life in German Medical Students At Foreign Universities|conference=RSU International Conference Health and Social Science|page= 168|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.3727.0008|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298419251_Quality_of_Life_and_Depression_in_German_Medical_Students_at_Foreign_Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis in the American journal ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' suggested depressive symptoms in 21% to 43% of all medical students.&lt;ref name=Mata/&gt;

The students make an effort to counteract the impact of stressful situations with various coping skills. The coping includes both cognitive and behavioral efforts against the problem of stress encountered during examinations.&lt;ref name=An&gt;{{cite journal |last1=An |first1=H |last2=Chunga |first2=S |year=2012 |title= Novelty-seeking and avoidance of coping strategies are associated with academic stress in Korean medical students |journal= Psychiatry Research |volume=200 |issue=16 |pages=464–468 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2012.07.048 |pmid=22901439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical students who fail to manage their stress levels have a tendency to be less competent in their work. Students who do not manage the time limits of examinations well lack time for exercise and social interactions because those two points are more stressful than the perceived discrimination on the course or the death of patients.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt;

==Physical effects==
Stress levels have a strong relationship with physical condition.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Medical students during an examination period can experience insomnia, fatigue, and nausea. Moreover, metabolism is disturbed by diarrhea or constipation. Skin diseases, including acne, dermatitis, and psoriasis, are common during the examination period. These symptoms are provoked by long working hours and the tension of completing the courses with good grades.&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizvi |first1=A |year=2010 |title= Pre-examination stress in second year medical students in a government college|pmid=21702291 |volume=22 |journal=J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad |pages=152–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students have been known to consume caffeinated beverages to be active and alert during time of studying. These students drink large quantities of coffee, tea, cola, and [[energy drink]]s. Though an increased intake of caffeine can increase the levels of [[adenosine]], [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], [[cortisol]] and dopamine in the blood, caffeine also inhibits the absorption of some nutrients, increasing the acidity of the gastrointestinal tract and depleting the levels of calcium, magnesium, iron and other trace minerals of the body through urinary excretion. Furthermore, caffeine decreases blood flow to the brain by as much as 30 percent, and it decreases the stimulation of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate the body's blood sugar level.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

Stress can cause high levels of the following hormones: [[norepinephrine]], [[leptin]], [[NPY]], [[nitrite]], [[ACTH]] and [[adrenomedullin]].&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; Elevated levels of adenosine, adrenaline, cortisol and [[dopamine]] in the blood can produce fatigue, depression, behavior changes, heart disease, weight problems, diabetes, and skin diseases. It also decreases the immune response, which can lead to heartburn and stomach ulcers.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;

The hormones of the [[menstrual cycle]] ([[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH)) during the examination periods are also affected.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; Female students may be disturbed during menstrual cycles because the FSH and LH normal levels changes radically. Medical students may also have disturbed sleep cycles in these periods.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

==Psychological effects==
An optimal level of stress is considered good because medical students develop coping abilities.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;  However, too much stress causes problems. Previous studies have reported that a significant percentage of medical students suffer anxiety disorders because stress has a strong relationship to emotional and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Feelings of disappointment academically are most prevalent in those students who have poor academic performance.&lt;ref name=Yusoff/&gt;

The major emotional disorders that have been observed include the inability to feel reasonably happy, loss of sleep, over-worry, constantly feeling under strain, feeling unhappy and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], inability to concentrate, inability to enjoy normal activities, losing confidence in one’s self, inability to overcome difficulties, inability to face up to problems, inability to make decisions, inability to play a useful part in things, and believing oneself to be worthless.&lt;ref name=Firth&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Firth |first1=J |year=1986 |title= Levels and sources of stress in medical students |journal= British Medical Journal |volume= 292|issue=65 |pages=1177–1180 |pmc=1340185 |pmid=3085772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given these emotional disorders, studies have also proved that medical students are more likely to have suicidal thoughts than students from other schools.

Female medical students may respond to the stress with stronger manifestations of anxiety. Physiological, psychological and behavioral stressors are found to be related to the metabolic changes of the body.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

Stress may also harm professional effectiveness. It decreases attention, reduces concentration, impinges on decision-making skills, and reduces the ability to establish strong physician–patient relationships.&lt;ref name=Barikana&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barikana |first1=A |year=2007 |title= Stress in Medical Students |journal= Journal of Medical Education |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical students have also noticed changes in their behavior when they are stressed. Irritability and depression are common in students in later semesters, and these mental disturbances increase when examinations start.&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt;

==Treatment==
As too much stress causes problems, it is important to evaluate the degree of stress a student may have. Today,{{when|date=December 2015}} there are methods to assess the level of emotional stress that medical students can handle. It is advisable to manage study time and include healthy nutrition during the whole day. In addition, daily exercises can help to reduce the stress.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; Interventions against [[academic dishonesty]] such as plagiarism also helps to prevent the risk of stress and depression in medical students. Studying in a small group also allows students to learn from each other and reduce the stress of learning by sharing ideas. Furthermore, some medical schools provide psychologists to help students manage stress.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;

Communication among third and fourth year medical students prepares them for the stressors of real-life clinical practice. This mental preparation stimulates the students to reduce the percentages of error in a medical consultation.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt; Medical students are prepared to diagnose and treat patients, but may not be adequately prepared to interact with the problems of their patient, or to deal with bad news as well as the patient's emotional stress during consultations.&lt;ref name=VanDulmen/&gt;

Emotional intelligence (EI) can be a protection against the effects of psychological stress, and it may enhance well-being. However, EI is molded through personality and has not been observed to be affected by stressful situations.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt; However, those students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower states of anxiety than those who are concentrated only on their studies.&lt;ref name=An/&gt;  To address these problems, some medical schools have made changes such as reducing the workweek, instituting curricular reforms such as having shorter classes, less rote memorization, and providing psychological services.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt;

Stress in medical students has become a focus of concern globally, with the first line of detection and defense of the stress being the students themselves. Some interventions include compulsory attendance in support groups, so the level of stigma is much lower than that associated with attending individual therapy. This provides long-term continuous support and help for students to monitor the progress and preparation for a better practice.&lt;ref name=ORourke/&gt;

Other stress-management programs provide trainees with coping techniques such as [[hypnosis]], imagery, and muscle relaxation; affiliation with peers, opportunities for emotional expression and intensified relationships with the faculty.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt;

The interventions of the majority of the programs use a group structure where the trainees meet with their peers, or with leaders.  No "gold standard" exists for the content of stress-reduction programs for medical trainees. Some propose a scheme of directed and non-directed support groups, relaxation training (including meditation and hypnosis), time-management and coping skills, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mentoring programs.&lt;ref name=Barikana/&gt; Good intervention includes relaxation basics like abdominal breathing, learning to identify and counter negative thoughts, use of the imagery in relaxation, practical ways to increase healthy eating, building positive coping, applying relaxing or activating words appropriately, and redirecting time and energy to different tasks based on the level of importance.&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brennan |first1=J |year=2010 |title= Stress Management Intervention for First Year Medical Students |journal= Annals of Behavioral Science and Medical Education |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=15–19|doi=10.1007/BF03355126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Swingtown''''' is an American [[television series]] created by [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelley]] as a [[midseason replacement|summer replacement]] series for [[CBS]].  The show was a [[Period piece|period]] and relationship [[Television drama|drama]] about the impact of sexual and social liberation in 1970s American suburban households, with [[story arc]]s involving [[open marriage]]s and [[Group sex#Key party|key parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Development Update: October 16–20 (Weekly Round-Up) |work=The Futon Critic |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7225 |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Swingtown'' premiered on Thursday June 5, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080414cbs02 |date=2008-04-14 |title=Breaking News - CBS unveils its 2008 summer schedule |work=The Futon Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the time slot previously occupied by ''[[Without a Trace]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  The show was also picked up by [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada, [[ITV3]] in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/222376 |title=TV lineup launch disrupted |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-15 |last=Bawden |first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 Ireland]] in Ireland, [[Network Ten]] in Australia, [[Rai 4]] in [[Italy]], [[Warner Channel]] in South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=warner073107.htm |work=World Screen |title=Warner Channel Takes CBS Paramount Titles |date=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universal Channel]] in Poland, TV 2 in Norway, Channel Four in New Zealand, and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalchannel.pl/|title=Universal Channel Poland -|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven episodes of declining ratings,&lt;ref name="bandc"/&gt; CBS moved the show's US airing to Fridays, swapping with ''[[Flashpoint (TV series)|Flashpoint]]'', which had outperformed'' Swingtown'' despite airing in a less favorable time slot.  ''Swingtown's'' first season's finale (ultimately the ''de facto'' series finale) aired on September 5.

Although the show's cancellation was suspected well in advance, it was made official on January 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |title=''Swingtown'' CBS (Finally) Officially Cancels the 1970s TV Show |publisher=TVSeriesFinale.com |accessdate=2009-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090122042735/http://tvseriesfinale.com/articles/swingtown-cbs-finally-officially-cancels-the-1970s-tv-show/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/tca-cbs-says-swingtown-not-coming-back-33963|title=TCA: CBS Says Swingtown Not Coming Back| publisher=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Set in the summer of 1976, the series begins with the relocation of the Miller family to a more affluent neighborhood in the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]], a suburban area of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Bruce Miller (played by [[Jack Davenport]]) is a futures trader working his way up in the business, married to Susan ([[Molly Parker]]). Susan Miller is a homemaker who got pregnant and married Bruce in high school. The couple have a teenage daughter, Laurie ([[Shanna Collins]]), and a young son Bruce Junior, nicknamed B.J. (Aaron Howles).

Tom and Trina Decker ([[Grant Show]] and [[Lana Parrilla]]) are the Millers' new neighbors. Tom, an airline [[aviator|pilot]], met Trina while she was a [[stewardess]]. The Deckers quickly befriend the Millers, and the Millers just as quickly learn that their new neighbors have an [[open marriage]].  The move strains the Millers' friendship with Roger and Janet Thompson ([[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Miriam Shor]]), their more conservative neighbors and friends from their old neighborhood. They try to maintain their friendship with the Millers, but the Thompsons are appalled when they learn about the Deckers' marital arrangement.  The Thompsons have a son, Rick ([[Nick Benson]]).

Although the show mostly focuses on the three couples, their children's stories are followed too, particularly Laurie, who is attracted to her summer school philosophy teacher ([[Michael Rady]]).  B.J. and Rick's friendship is also tested by the move, and B.J. meets Samantha Saxton ([[Brittany Robertson]]), an enigmatic girl who lives next door to him in his new neighborhood.

==Pre-production==
Producers [[Mike Kelley (writer)|Mike Kelley]] ([[head writer]]) and  [[Alan Poul]] first pitched their idea to [[Home Box Office|HBO]], where Poul, who had worked on ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', had a development deal.   Poul said HBO passed on the opportunity at least in part because it already had ''[[Big Love]]'' in production and ''[[Tell Me You Love Me (TV series)|Tell Me You Love Me]]'' in development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  The two next approached [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], but before discussions with that network went anywhere, CBS Entertainment president [[Nina Tassler]] found out about the proposal and within a couple of days, had read the script; she gave the series the [[greenlight]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jacques Steinberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/arts/television/11stei.html?_r=2 |title=Take My Wife.

==Reception==
The 26 critics included in the show's [[Metacritic]] gave it mixed reviews (a "metascore" of 49).  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the series "exhibits rare depth" and includes "plenty of nifty touches, from the pop-song score and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' fashions to the first-rate cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Lowry |url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/swingtown-1200522018/ |title=Review: 'Swingtown' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "even skillful performances by its largely unknown cast aren't able to hide the lack of character development and the sense that the people in this series are almost self-parodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barry Garron |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/swingtown-125599 |title=Swingtown |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Salon (website)|Salon]] called it "stylish and '70s-sexy but also shallow enough to feel like a less funny, hollowed-out combination of ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' and ''Boogie Nights'' &amp;mdash; which is exactly what the show's creators told the ''New York Times'' they were aiming for (without using the words 'less funny' and 'hollowed-out' of course)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Heather Havrilesky |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |title=I Like to Watch |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526040104/http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/iltw/2008/05/25/swingtown/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Controversy===
The [[American Family Association]] urged members to write letters of complaint to the media,&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite news |work=The News Tribune (Tacoma, WA) |title=War on ''Swingtown'' |first=Cheryl |last=Tucker |page=3 |date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Parents Television Council]] followed a failed [[boycott]] attempt with an effort to convince CBS affiliates to preempt the program.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite news |work=Philadelphia Daily News |title=Around the channels, from 'Swingtown' to Disney |first=Ellen |last=Gray |date=2008-06-12 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=128184|title=Advertisers Don't Party With CBS's Swingers|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ace Hardware]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917141903/http://www.onemillionmoms.com/IssueDetail.asp?id=308 |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stopped advertising on the serial.

Lindsay Soll writes that one "producer thinks of sophisticated swingers Tom and Trina (Show and Parilla) in a ‘''[[Great Gatsby]]''-like way,’ calling them 'the shining couple across the street.'  Exactly why we'd get in bed with them--er, the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindsay Soll |title=TV on DVD |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |volume=1026 |page=58 |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audience interest dwindled as the summer progressed.  After a strong [[pilot episode]], [[#Ratings|the ratings for ''Swingtown'']] got progressively worse, aided{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} by [[Friday night death slot|a mid-season move from Thursdays to Friday]].

According to executive producer [[Alan Poul]], the first season ending was shot with the show's uncertain future in mind:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Michael Ausiello]] |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903003946/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/08/grant-show-to-g.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-03 |title=Exclusive: ''Private Practice'' Paging Grant Show... |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The season ends with a [[cliffhanger]], but it's also a completely satisfying ending.  So, if we go forward, there are many new things that are set up to explore. And if we don't go forward, there's no feeling that we've been left with something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poor ratings led CBS to see if any cable networks, or perhaps [[DirecTV]], were interested in picking it up.&lt;ref name="bandc"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Melissa Grego |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/cbs-paramount-shopping-swingtown-cable-nets/33089 |title=CBS Paramount Shopping ''Swingtown'' to Cable Nets |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]] decided to acquire rights to the existing episodes, but did not order any new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/01/14/cbs-confirms-swingtown-is-cancelled/ |title=CBS Confirms ''Swingtown'' is Cancelled |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TIRA has a 34-metre [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] is a [[monopulse radar]] operating at 1.333 GHz or 22.5 cm ([[L band]]) and 16.7 GHz or 1.8 cm ([[Ku band]]) [[wavelength]]s.&lt;ref name=tira&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhr.fraunhofer.de/en/the_institute/technical-equipment/Space-observation-radar-TIRA.html|title=Space observation radar TIRA|publisher=Fraunhofer FHR|access-date=2015-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501164108/http://www.fhr.fraunhofer.de/en/the_institute/technical-equipment/Space-observation-radar-TIRA.html|archivedate=2015-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L-band is usually used for tracking debris with a 0.45° beam width, at 1 MW peak power. The system is capable of determining [[orbit]]s from direction angles, range and [[Doppler shift]] for single targets. The detection size threshold is about 2 cm at 1000 km range.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin133/bul133f_klinkrad.pdf|title=Europe's Eyes on the Skies|publisher=ESA|access-date=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radar conducts regular ‘beam park’ experiments, where the radar beam is pointed in a fixed direction on the [[celestial sphere]] for 24 hours, scanning 360° in a narrow strip a complete Earth rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing |title=ESA – Space Debris – Scanning &amp; observing|publisher=ESA|access-date=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracking sensitive can be enhanced when the TIRA system is used as a transmitter, part of a [[bistatic radar]] system. In conjunction with the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]], functioning as a receiver, the combined system has a detection size threshold of 1 cm. The Ku-band is used for [[radar imaging|imaging]] in [[Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar]] (ISAR) mode, with 13 kW peak power, the radar is capable of producing images with range resolutions better than 7 cm.&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt; The dish can be turned full 360° in [[azimuth]] with speed of 24° per second and 90° in [[elevation]]. The radar is protected by a [[radome]] with 47 meters diameter – one of the largest in the world. &lt;ref name=tira/&gt;

TeachEngineering’s curricular items are aligned to K-12 science, technology, engineering and math ([[Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics|STEM]]) [[academic standards]] such as the [[Next Generation Science Standards]], [[Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative#Mathematics_standards|Common Core Math standards]] and the [[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Carleigh C., Sullivan, Jacquelyn F., Reitsma René F. and Soltys, Michael A.

Retrieved 27 June, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]] initially funded the creation of the TeachEngineering library through its [[National Science Digital Library|National Science Digital Library (NSDL)]] program&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://www.teachengineering.org/about/history “History.”] TeachEngineering Digital Library. Retrieved 27 June, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. University engineering faculty, graduate students and K-12 teachers from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], [[Colorado School of Mines]], [[Duke University]] and [[Tufts University]] who had independently developed K-12 engineering curriculum, bundled their curricular products into a single, standardized and searchable digital library&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. By 2017, more than 50 institutions had contributed curriculum&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkengineering.org/15/244/45362.aspx “TeachEngineering”] Organization page, LinkEngineering, National Academy of Engineering. Retrieved June 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty and students at [[Oregon State University]] designed and developed the supporting information system&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. In 2015, the system was re-designed and rebuilt at the University of Colorado Boulder. About 3 million unique users visit the library annually&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Forbes, Marissa H., Sullivan, Jacquelyn F. and Carlson, Denise W. (2017) [https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/78/papers/17882/view “Ascertaining the Impact of P-12 Engineering Education Initiatives: Student Impact through Teacher Impact,”] Proceedings, ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition, Columbus, OH, June.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Use Patterns==
[[File:TeachEngineering daily visits.png|Year-long trace of TeachEngineering visits.]]&lt;br&gt;
TeachEngineering usage closely tracks the US K-12 school seasons. As one can see from the figure above, daily demand follows a strict weekly cycle with usage consistently lowest on Saturdays. Usage starts to increase on Sundays when teachers prepare for classes for the coming week and further increases through Wednesdays. On Thursdays and Fridays demand decreases back toward the Saturday low. On a larger cycle, usage typically increases from the start of the school year (in August) to a peak in late March (around [[spring break]]), after which it starts trending down toward the summer vacation. Holidays such as [[Independence_Day_(United_States)|the Fourth of July]], and [[Thanksgiving]] also clearly stand out in this one-year long trajectory of daily use.

==Motivation==
The initial motivation to create the library was the desire to preserve and widely share the outcomes from NSF’s investment in K-12 engineering curriculum development through the creation of a single standardized, searchable and standards-aligned platform&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Ongoing motivations include:
* To create and maintain a collection of freely available, standards-based engineering curriculum, for the purpose of improving STEM literacy&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.
* To provide curriculum that uses engineering as the vehicle for early development of engineering habits of mind for all youth&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.
* To attract more, and more diverse students to the field of engineering&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1544495 NSF Grant no. EEC 1544495: TeachEngineering: Expanding and Sustaining Curriculum Access for K-12 Teachers; 2015]. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1544495&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
* To support educators in meeting academic learning standards by aligning curricular materials with K-12 national, international and/or state standards&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.
* To provide K-12 science and math teachers with science-rich hands-on engineering curriculum at little to no cost&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Technology==
During 2003-15, TeachEngineering ran on a [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP stack]] hosted at Oregon State University’s Open Source Lab (OSL). In 2015, the system was reimplemented on a Windows/IIS/RavenDB/C# stack and is currently hosted on [[Microsoft Azure]] and maintained by the [[University_of_Colorado_Boulder|University of Colorado, Boulder]].

In the theory of [[empirical knowledge]], '''the problem of the speckled hen''' is whether a single immediate [[observation]] of a [[wikt:speckle|speckle]]d [[chicken|hen]] provides a certain knowledge of the number of speckles observed. Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and therefore it is of fundamental nature.&lt;ref name=chis42&gt;[[Roderick Chisholm]], "The Problem of the Speckled Hen", ''Mind'' 51 (1942): pp.&amp;nbsp;368–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of [[knowledge by acquaintance]]: one is unable to know with [[certainty]] the existence of determinate things in one's experience merely by the virtue of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/ "Certainty"], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick Chisholm]] attributes it to [[Gilbert Ryle]] suggesting to [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=chis42/&gt; It is viewed as a critisicm of the view expressed by [[C. I. Lewis]] that there can never be "positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer".&lt;ref&gt;C. I. Lewis, Mind and the World-Order, p. 128, As cited by Chisholm (1942). &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heath]] remarks that this problem is one of the "descendants of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s '[[chiliagon]]' argument in the sixth of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''". &lt;ref name=heath2008&gt;[[Joseph Heath]], ''Following the Rules: Practical Reasoning and Deontic Constraint'', Oxford: OUP, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;305, note&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it is incorrect to suggest that the "sense-data" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact they have been enumerated. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphacises the fact that there are basic propositions ([[synthetic proposition]]s which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) that are necessarily imprecise. &lt;ref name=chis42/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2992">'''Thomas Glazier''' of [[Oxford]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 1386-1427) was a master glazier active in England during the late 14th and early 15th century; he is one of the earliest identifiable [[stained glass]] artists, and is considered a leading proponent of the [[International Gothic]] style.&lt;ref name=marks178&gt;Marks, R. ''Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 1993, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography, works==
[[Image:Winchester College Chapel East Window.jpg|thumb|right|The East Window of [[Winchester College]] Chapel. The glass largely dates from an 1820s restoration, but is a fairly accurate copy of Glazier's original window.]]

Glazier's workshops were based in Oxford, and he was clearly an important figure in the town; he is recorded in New College's Steward's Book as being regularly invited to dine with the Warden and Fellows.&lt;ref name=om&gt;''[http://archive.oxfordmail.net/2008/2/8/223233.html Glazier's Magnificent Seven]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}'', ''The Oxford Times'', 08-02-08&lt;/ref&gt; Although we have some record of his professional activities (and appearance; see below) almost nothing is known of his personal life, other than that he was married.&lt;ref name=odnb455&gt;Matthew, H. ''et al.'' (eds.) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p.455&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazier is particularly notable for his early adoption of elements of the emerging International Gothic style in his work: he may have been influenced by his contacts with European artists through [[William of Wykeham]] and his circle.&lt;ref name=marks46&gt;Marks, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; His work is characterised by sophisticated draughtsmanship and placement of figures, and also by its remarkable stylistic development, indicating that such artists were open to absorbing new ideas during the course of their careers.&lt;ref name=marks46&gt;Marks, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the work of [[John Thornton (glass painter)|John Thornton]] of [[Coventry]], Glazier's style was highly influential. It is possible that Robert Lyen, who made windows for [[Exeter Cathedral]], was his [[apprentice]].&lt;ref name="marks178"/&gt;

Glazier's work survives in the chapels of [[New College, Oxford]] and of [[Winchester College]]. The latter scheme contains an 1822 copy of a self-portrait included in the original east window: this depicts him kneeling in prayer, wearing a long [[gown]] and with a short, forked beard of the sort fashionable in the late 14th century. There is a panel probably executed by him in the church of [[Thenford]], [[Northamptonshire]], as well as windows in [[Winchester Cathedral]] and the chapel of [[Merton College, Oxford]].

A '''toxidrome''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[toxic]]'' and ''[[syndrome]]'') is a syndrome caused by a dangerous level of [[toxin]]s in the body. The term was coined in 1970 by Mofenson and Greensher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Anticholinergic==&lt;!-- section is linked from [[Atropine]] --&gt;
The symptoms of an [[anticholinergic]] toxidrome include blurred vision, [[coma]], decreased [[bowel]] sounds, [[delirium]], dry [[skin]], [[fever]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[hallucination]]s, [[ileus]], [[memory loss]], [[mydriasis]] (dilated [[pupils]]), [[myoclonus]], [[psychosis]], [[seizure]]s, and [[urinary retention]].  [[Complication (medicine)|Complication]]s include [[hypertension]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include  [[antihistamine]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[antiparkinsonian]] drugs, [[atropine]], [[benztropine]], [[datura]], and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]].&lt;ref name="firstaid" /&gt;

==Cholinergic==
The symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome include [[bronchorrhea]], [[confusion]], [[defecation]], [[diaphoresis]], [[diarrhea]], [[emesis]], [[lacrimation]], [[miosis]], [[muscle fasciculation]]s, [[salivation]], [[seizure]]s, [[urination]], and weakness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypothermia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[carbamate]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[organophosphate]]s.

==Hallucinogenic==
The symptoms of a hallucinogenic toxidrome include [[disorientation]], [[hallucination]]s, hyperactive bowel sounds, [[panic]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[substituted amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[phencyclidine]].

==Opiate==
The symptoms of an opiate toxidrome include the classic triad of [[coma]], [[miosis|pinpoint pupils]], and [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]]&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt; as well as [[Altered state of consciousness|altered mental state]]s, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[pulmonary edema]] and unresponsiveness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], and [[hypothermia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome are [[opioids]].

==Sedative/hypnotic==
The symptoms of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[coma]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], deterioration of [[central nervous system]] functions, [[diplopia]], [[dysesthesias]], [[hallucination]]s, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[paresthesias]], [[sedation]], slurred speech, and [[stupor]].  [[Apnea]] is a potential complication.  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]], [[Methaqualone]], and [[ethanol]]. While most sedative-hypnotics are [[anticonvulsant]], some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] in overdose.

==Sympathomimetic==
The symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include [[anxiety]], [[delusion]]s, [[diaphoresis]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[mydriasis]], [[paranoia]], [[piloerection]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[salbutamol]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ephedrine]] ([[Ma Huang]]), [[methamphetamine]], [[phenylpropanolamine]] (PPA's), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. It may appear very similar to the anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt;

In [[semiotics]], the '''value''' of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] depends on its position and relations in the system of signification and upon the particular [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] being used.

==Saussure's value==

[[File:Semiotic Value.GIF|thumb|left|the internal, vertical relationship between signifier and signified is distinct from the horizontal relation of values between signs.]]

Value is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms ''redouter'' ("to dread"), ''craindre'' ("to fear"), and ''avoir peur'' ("to be afraid") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its "extra something" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from.

For de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of 
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who indirectly influenced Saussure&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2869724.ece The Poet who could Smell Vowels]&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another.

Value determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, "zena" is useful because it stands in contrast to "zenb" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, "zena" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility.

It must also be noted that it is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes "thought-sound" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.

== Definitions ==
=== Saussure ===
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and 
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a ''thing'' rather than the thing itself.

This emphasises that the sign is merely a [[symbol]] for the [[class (philosophy)|class]] of [[object (philosophy)|object]] referred to. Hence, the [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word or noun "box" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or [[audience]] may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word.

However, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently ''boxy'' about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun "box"—the scope of [[onomatopoeia]] is limited when forming a [[language]]. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to [[denotation (Semiotics)|denote]] the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising "air" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water.

This makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], but one which is conditioned by [[history]] and [[culture]], i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]].

Further, [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982)  proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her [[discourse]]. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a [[cognitive]] use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values.

=== Barthes ===
Because signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of,  ''inter alios'', [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: "...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification" (1967, 9). 

In the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is ''not'' present can be just as significant as what is present.

In a slightly different context of critique through the ''archaeological'' and ''genealogical'' methods for the study of [[knowledge]], [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) used the idea of [[discontinuity (Postmodernism)|discontinuity]] as a means to ''revalorise'' elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked.

==Methods==
The [[commutation test (Semiotics)|commutation test]] can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the [[paradigms]] and [[code (Semiotics)|code]] to which the signifiers used belong.

[[Paradigmatic analysis]] compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual’s own technique, or because of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]], generic [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] and [[rhetoric]]al purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.

'''White Sands Test Facility''' (WSTF) is a U.S. government [[rocket engine test facility]] and a resource for testing and evaluating potentially hazardous materials, space flight components, and rocket propulsion systems. [[NASA]] established WSTF on the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/about/wstfcomm.html | title=WSTF Community |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; WSTF services are available to NASA, the [[United States Department of Defense]], other federal agencies, universities and commercial industry. WSTF is managed by the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]]. WSTF is located in the western foothills of the [[Organ Mountains]], eleven miles east of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]].

==Activities and facilities==
===Rocket propulsion===
The primary mission of WSTF is to support NASA's [[Space Station]] program, and previously the [[Space Shuttle]]. As the official Johnson Space Center (JSC) Propulsion Systems Development Facility, WSTF participates in propulsion systems testing, with test expertise in [[hypergolic]] and mono-propellant handling and training.  During the orbiter's life WSTF also managed and operated the Shuttle Fleet Leader program which consisted of testing orbital maneuvering and reaction control (thruster) subsystems.[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/propulsion/index.html WSTF Propulsion]

White Sands Test Facility offers numerous ambient pressure and altitude simulation stands to test rocket propulsion test systems as well as single rocket engines.

===White Sands Space Harbor===
WSTF operates the [[White Sands Space Harbor]] (WSSH), which was the primary training area for Space Shuttle pilots.  [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/spaceharbor/index.html WSSH]

===Chemical and physical properties of materials===
The engineers, chemists, and scientists in WSTF laboratories conduct testing of hazardous materials and propellants, air quality, aerospace hardware and ground support equipment, and all materials used in space flight. Standard Testing for DOT, ASTM and NASA, as well as ignition and flammability testing is routinely performed.

===Hazards assessment===
WSTF laboratory facilities conduct hazardous fluid assessment, hypervelocity tests, and explosive hazard assessment. The High Energy Blast Facility performs explosive testing with solid, cryogenic, hypergolic propellants, and other high explosives.

===Oxygen systems===
Oxygen compatibility is a critical issue in space, aircraft, medical, and industrial applications. At WSTF, researchers investigate the effects of increased oxygen concentration on the ignition and burning of materials and components used in these applications. Hazards analyses are performed on materials, components, and systems; and failure analyses determine the cause of fires. Training courses about design and operation of safe oxygen systems are provided by WSTF personnel under the auspices of ASTM.  [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/oxygen/index.html WSTF NASA Oxygen Systems]

===Space flight hardware===
The Propulsion Component Test Facility at WSTF is an International Space Station Depot Repair Facility.  Flight hardware assembly, repair, and acceptance testing for private aerospace manufacturers is performed. WSTF refurbished hypergolic propellant components for the Space Shuttle, handle advanced pyrovalve testing at two laboratory facilities, and perform failure investigations.  [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/hardware/index.html WSTF NASA Hardware Processing]

===Launch and landing support===
[[White Sands Space Harbor]] (WSSH) was the primary training area for Space Shuttle pilots flying practice approaches and landings in the shuttle-training aircraft and T-38 aircraft.  Runways, navigational aids, runway lighting, and control facilities continuously stood ready as a backup Shuttle landing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/spaceharbor/index.html | title = White Sands Space Harbor | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health, safety, and environment at WSTF==
Since the late 1990s, NASA and a series of subcontractors have been working under the oversight of the New Mexico Environment Department to remediate a large plume of polluted ground water caused by repeated leaks and spills of cleaning fluids and rocket propellants at the site. Remediation has involved the construction of six wells from which the groundwater is pumped; a UV reactor which treats the contaminated water; and four injection wells to inject the cleaned water back into the water table. A second, similar system is currently in the planning stage.
