'''Alfred University''' is a small, comprehensive university in the [[Alfred (village), New York|Village of Alfred]], [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] in [[Western New York|Western]] [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and southeast of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Alfred has an undergraduate population of around 2,000, and approximately 300 graduate students. The institution has five schools and colleges.

==Background==
Alfred was founded in 1836 as the '''Select School''' by [[Seventh Day Baptists]] as a [[non-sectarian]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/univ_hist/history_of_au.cfm |title=History of AU |publisher=Herr.alfred.edu |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312100609/http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/univ_hist/history_of_au.cfm |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for the time, the school was [[co-educational]]. It was also racially integrated, and enrolled its first African-American student and two Native American students in the 1850s, becoming the second college in the nation after [[Berea College]] in Berea, Kentucky, to do so.

The origin of the name "Alfred" is uncertain. Residents of the town and students at the two schools believe that the town received its name in honor of [[Alfred the Great]], king of the Saxons, although the first documented occurrence of this connection was in 1881, 73 years after the first record of the name being used to describe the geophysical area during assignments by the state legislature. State records which might have verified the connection between the Saxon king and the university were lost in a fire in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred's Town Name |url=http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/histories/alfreds_town_name.asp |accessdate=August 12, 2007 |first=Susan |last=Strong |year=1997 |work=Herrick Library Special Collections and Archives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719034206/http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/histories/alfreds_town_name.asp |archivedate=July 19, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether the connection is historically accurate, Alfred University has embraced King Alfred as a [[symbol]] of the school's values, and a statue of the king stands in the center of the campus quad.

Since its founding, Alfred University has hosted guest lecturers, artists and musicians from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=E. H.|title=Allen of Alfred: Some of His Words|year=2007|publisher=Kessinger Press|isbn=978-0-548-05765-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ghostface Killah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community: Events: Hot Dog Day 2011|url=http://www.alfred.edu/community/hdd.cfm|work=Alfred University Website|publisher=AU ITS|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, Alfred University received national attention when freshman, Eric Zuckerman, orchestrated a campus visit from then–First Lady, [[Hillary Clinton]], during her campaign for the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;http://dspace.alfred.edu/bitstream/handle/10829/3023/20000503.pdf?sequence=1{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred University, together with [[Corning Incorporated]] and the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] created the [[Ceramic Corridor]], a high-tech incubator project designed to take advantage of the emerging ceramics industry and to create new jobs. This unique industrial development program is the only one in the United States concentrating on one single aspect of technology – high-tech ceramics – and it is the only major industrial development project centered in a rural area in the U.S.

[[File:Alfred University Campus April 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aerial view of Alfred University taken in April 2006]]

Extending to the 20th and 21st centuries, Alfred has continued its progressive history of defending equal rights for members of the community. In 1971, Alfred became only the fourth municipality in the U.S. to ban employment discrimination based on sexuality. In the mid-1990s, the university became one of the first to strip credit for ROTC programs, which exhibit prejudice on basis of sexual orientation. However, students attending Alfred University are still free to receive an Army ROTC contract with full tuition paid and attend military science classes through St. Bonaventure University. Amidst the dissolution of the AU Greek System, the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity chapter at Alfred University led an overwhelmingly successful effort to ban discrimination based on religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation in the constitution of the 210 chapter international fraternity in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities | first = Shane L. | last = Windmeyer | publisher = Alyson Publications | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-55583-409-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That action triggered several other national fraternities and sororities to follow suit.

==History==
[[File:Kanakadea Hall at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|right|Originally built in 1884, Kanakadea Hall served as Alfred's schoolhouse until a large fire destroyed the tower and devastated the second floor in 1907. It was sold to Alfred University and repaired in 1908. The exterior has since been restored to its original appearance, although the interior has been fully modernized. The building now houses the Division of Human Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Edward G. Coll and Carole Hulse Coll Center at Kanakadea | url = http://alfred.edu/map/kanakadea.html | accessdate =April 27, 2008 | author = Alfred University | work = Alfred University Campus Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Statue of King Alfred at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The statue of King Alfred stands at the center of AU's quad, and is often decorated by students. In this picture, he is wearing one of the purple shirts worn by student Orientation Guides (OGs) during the 2006 freshman orientation.]]

[[File:Hot Dog Day 2007 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Main Street and part of AU during Hot Dog Day]]

Alfred University is not to be confused with the [[Alfred State College]]. Although autonomous, both institutions have their origins in the Alfred Select School, and were heavily shaped by Boothe C. Davis. In 1908 Davis petitioned the New York State Legislature to fund the New York State College of Agriculture at Alfred University.

In 1941 Alfred State College became an autonomous junior college due to increased enrollment and increasing needs, which Alfred University could not accommodate, and in 1948 became a member of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Students of both schools still share a few Alfred peculiarities including: a physical education requirement for most programs, a short break in October dubbed "minibreak", sharing of clubs and organizations (excluding Greek lettered organizations), and cross-registration of classes not offered at the other institution.

==Mascot, events and culture==

Alfred University's mascot is the [[Saxon people|Saxon]], a [[knight]] in shining armor. Since the year 871 is when King Alfred the Great succeeded his brother, [[Æthelred of Wessex|Ethelred I]] as King of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]] (see [[Alfred the Great#Childhood|Alfred the Great's childhood]]), the [[telephone exchange]] of Alfred University is 871 (i.e., all AU phone numbers take the form 1-607-871-xxxx).

[[Hot dog day|Hot Dog Day]] is held in early April of each year since 1972 at Alfred to raise money for local charities and community-based civic organizations. It is a joint project with [[Alfred State College]] coordinated by students and staff from both schools. Typical events include a carnival, small amusement park rides, mud olympics, concerts, a parade, and the consumption of hot dogs. In recent years approximately $7,000 to $8,000 has been raised for charities including the local fire departments, public library, and day care centers.

Alfred's [http://www.alfred.edu/map/carillon.html Davis Memorial Carillon], erected in 1937 as a tribute to longtime president [http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/people/davis.shtml Boothe C. Davis], can often be heard while on campus. The bells of the [[carillon]], purchased from [[Antwerp]], were thought to be the oldest bells in the western hemisphere. Research later (2004) showed that the bells were of a more recent vintage, and that Alfred had been the victim of a fraud. On the brighter side, the non-historic nature of the bells allows the university to replace those that have poor tonal quality. Concerts continue four times a week when school is in session (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm and Saturday at 4&amp;nbsp;pm), and during the summer months at least once a week. Besides the resident carilloneur, guest carilloneurs have in the past frequently visited and played during the summer.

The Black Knight&lt;ref&gt;[http://herrick.alfred.edu/special/archives/traditions/black_knight_story.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126004757/http://herrick.alfred.edu/special/archives/traditions/black_knight_story.shtml |date=November 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been a part of Alfred University folklore for a long time. The relic was originally part of a parlor stove in a classroom in Kanakadea Hall. When the stove was discarded, the figure was claimed by the Class of 1908 as their mascot. They passed it on to the Class of 1910, thus causing a "war of possession" between the even and odd numbered classes. Many times over the years it disappeared and re-appeared on campus. After a particularly long time away it was returned in 1977 and placed in the University Archives. In 2005 it was transferred to a glass case in the Powell Campus Center along with a plaque describing its history. Many students had heard of the Black Knight during their freshmen orientation and were delighted to have him on display. However, after only a few months, the glass enclosure was destroyed in the middle of the night and the Black Knight stolen.

Alfred University was mentioned on [[Saturday Night Live]] once in 1975 by host and Alfred University alumnus [[Robert Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75eklein.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Robert Klein: 11/15/75: Robert Klein |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Klein hosted SNL again in 1977, he talked at length about Alfred University in his monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77jmono.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Robert Klein: 01/21/78: Robert Klein's Monologue |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Miller Performing Arts Center at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|right|The Miller Performing Arts Center]]
[[File:Alfred University Powell Campus Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Powell Campus Center]]

Alfred is especially well known for its programs in ceramic art, ceramic engineering, glass engineering, and has a strong astronomy program due in part to the presence on campus of the 7-telescope [[Stull Observatory]], which has one of the largest optical telescope in [[New York (state)|New York state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.alfred.edu/physics |title=Alfred University - College of Liberal Arts and Sciences - Physics &amp; Astronomy |publisher=Las.alfred.edu |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asteroid [[31113 Stull]] was named for John Stull, founder and caretaker of the observatory.

There are two libraries on Alfred's campus, the [http://www.herr.alfred.edu/ Herrick Memorial Library], which primarily serves the private colleges, and the [http://scholes.alfred.edu/ Scholes Library], which primarily serves the New York State College of Ceramics. The Alfred Ceramic Art Museum has a collection of 8,000 ceramic objects, including both ancient and modern ceramic art and craft.

The Bromley-Daggett Equestrian Center, located at the Maris Cuneo Equine Park, was constructed in 2005. It hosts equine classes, an intramural equestrian team, varsity and JV for both [[English riding|English]] and [[Western riding|Western]] disciplines, clinics, and horse shows. Stalls are available for boarding by university students. The facility has an indoor arena of 16000&amp;nbsp;ft² and lighted outdoor arenas of {{convert|28800|and|10800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}; the entire property consists of {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of land.

The Miller Performing Arts Center was dedicated in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Miller Performing Arts Center wins international recognition | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1511 | accessdate =September 17, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = February 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni Hall===
[[File:AlumniHall2004.JPG|thumb|Alumni Hall]]
Now used primarily to house the Admissions Department, [[Alumni Hall (Alfred, New York)|Alumni Hall]] has a place on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The former University academy building, with cathedral ceilings, and offices far up into the cupola is a beautiful example of 19th-century American architecture in Alfred. In the 1990s, Alumni Hall was saved through a restoration effort. Alfred University was once associated with the Seventh Day Baptist Church, and included a school of theology. While the religious connection no longer exists, the architecture of Alumni Hall and other buildings on campus reflect this heritage.

==Colleges and schools==
Alfred University offers over 60 majors and areas of concentration at its four colleges and schools. Alfred's four private colleges are [http://las.alfred.edu/ The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences], [http://ps.alfred.edu/ The College of Professional Studies], [http://engineering.alfred.edu/ The Inamori School of Engineering], and [http://www.alfred.edu/gradschool The Graduate School]. [http://business.alfred.edu/ The School of Business] is part of The College of Professional Studies.

The [[New York State College of Ceramics]] (NYSCC) consists of the School of Art and Design, with its own dean, and four state-supported materials programs cross-organized within Alfred University's School of Engineering. The College of Ceramics is functioning technically as a "holding entity" for the fiscal support of the state programs and the NYSCC mission. The unit head assists with budget preparation for the two aforementioned AU schools and the NYSCC-affiliated Scholes Library of Ceramics (part of the campuswide, unified AU library system), and acts in a liaison role to SUNY.

The School of Art and Design, technically a sub-unit of the College of Ceramics but autonomously run with its own dean, is further subdivided into divisions. A visit to the school in 2009 led media historian Siegfried Zielinski to state that Alfred is "the center of alchemy for the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;Edizel, Gerar (2009). "Process is Concept", p.3. St Vincent Press, Rochester, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's School of Engineering (also autonomously run with its own dean) currently has four state-supported programs and two privately endowed programs.

==Museums and galleries==

Alfred University and The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) are associated with five galleries: [[Alfred Ceramic Art Museum]], The Cohen Center for the Arts Gallery, The Fosdick-Nelson Gallery, Robert C. Turner Gallery, and Institute for Electronic Art's (IEA) John Woods Studios. Other mentionable exhibition spaces for undergraduate and graduate students to show work include the Sculpture Dimensional Studies Exhibition Spaces (the Cube, the Box and the Cell Space), the Printmaking Critique Room, Flex Space, the New Deal, and Rhodes Room. Work from permanent collections are also on exhibition in the Saxon Inn and around campus in the offices of faculty.

===The Robert C. Turner Gallery===
Alfred University's student-run gallery, the Robert C. Turner Gallery was founded in 2011. The gallery has two floors; the main space and the catwalk in which also has the "black box" interactive space for expanded (electronic) media. This gallery space is named after Internationally acclaimed artist and Alfred University alumnus, [[Robert Chapman Turner|Robert C. Turner]]. Turner was a professor of ceramic art at Alfred University with a sixty-year-long career in ceramics. Turner once said,&lt;ref&gt;"What part, if any, can and should the art world play in revitalizing people of a perhaps degenerative culture, a culture in which people seem to be morally soft, often, and unaware of their actions, insensitive to the moral religious values in situations. Have not art and those people who know its value more to say than they have said, not only to make art a more vital and integral part of community life, but to minister to the spiritual needs in the broadest sense of the term?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===IEA John Wood Studios===

NYSCC is host to the John Wood Studios of the Institute of Electronic Arts (IEA) within the School of Art and Design (SoAD), NYSCC which offers a residency program for up to two weeks for international artists.

==Student life==

===Greek social organizations===
{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}
Fraternities and sororities were established at Alfred University for nearly 100 years prior to 2002, when they were discontinued, partially in response to the death of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] (ZBT) fraternity member Benjamin Klein under suspicious circumstances and charges of gross negligence on behalf of the fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Alfred University implements new requirements for Greek organizations | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1042 | accessdate =August 12, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eliminating_frats"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Alfred University trustees vote to eliminate fraternities and sororities | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1701 | accessdate =August 12, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = May 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Klein's death in 1978, student [[Chuck Stenzel]] died in a [[hazing]]-related incident at Alfred's Klan Alpine fraternity. After Stenzel's death, his mother, Eileen Stevens, created a lobbying organization to increase awareness of hazing and promote anti-hazing laws, as documented in Hank Nuwer's book "Broken Pledges" and a later TV movie of the same name (in which Alfred was not named for legal reasons). Stevens later served as an advisor to Alfred on hazing-related issues, and received an honorary doctorate from the school in 1999.

During the summer of 2002, all [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek social organizations]] lost recognition after an in-depth analysis of the Alfred University Greek system by an eight-member task force appointed by the Board of Trustees. More than 50% of the task force were themselves members of a fraternity or sorority while in college, and 82% of the Board of Trustees are Alfred University alumni.&lt;ref name="eliminating_frats"/&gt;

At the time of closing in 2002, the Greek system at Alfred University included national and international fraternities [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], since 1909, [[Sigma Alpha Mu]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Alpha Chi Rho]], [[Delta Sigma Phi]], and [[Zeta Beta Tau]]; as well as local fraternities Kappa Psi Upsilon, and Klan Alpine. The sororities included [[Delta Zeta]], Theta Theta Chi, Alpha Kappa Omicron, and Sigma Chi Nu. The overall Greek community made significant contributions to Alfred University, Alfred, NY, and the surrounding communities, such as annual food drives that raised more than {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}} of food each fall for the Hornell food bank. Hot Dog Day Weekend, one of the largest and most successful community gatherings in Alfred,  was created by the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha, as a way to raise money for charity efforts.  The event was organized and run by the fraternities and sororities at Alfred University for nearly 30 years. Many of the societies have highly active alumni associations, some of which gather at Alfred University reunions, or at independent functions.

===Other organizations===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23779">An '''artificial intelligence arms race''' is a competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "[[artificial intelligence]]" (AI). Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have argued that a such a global arms race for better artificial intelligence has already begun.

== Stances toward military artificial intelligence ==
=== Russia ===
[[File:Russia_President_Vladimir_Putin_at_National_Knowledge_Day,_2017.jpg|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|Putin (seated, center) at National Knowledge Day, 2017]]
Russian General [[Viktor Bondarev]], commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, has stated that as early as February 2017, Russia has been working on AI-guided missiles that can decide to switch targets mid-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia is building a missile that can makes its own decisions|url=http://www.newsweek.com/russia-military-challenge-us-china-missile-own-decisions-639926|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=Newsweek|date=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Elon Musk is right about the threat posed by Russian artificial intelligence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elon-musk-ai-artificial-intelligence-world-war-three-russia-china-robots-cyber-warfare-replicants-a7931981.html|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=The Independent|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the CEO of Russia's Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that "there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact", and that it is inevitable that "swarms of drones" will one day fly over combat zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia is developing autonomous "swarms of drones" it calls an inevitable part of future warfare|url=http://www.newsweek.com/drones-swarm-autonomous-russia-robots-609399|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=Newsweek|date=15 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such as [[Kalashnikov Concern|Kalashnikov]]'s "neural net" combat module, with a machine gun, a camera, and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Mark|title=Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41035201|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in 16,000 Russian schools, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind... Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial Intelligence Fuels New Global Arms Race|url=https://www.wired.com/story/for-superpowers-artificial-intelligence-fuels-new-global-arms-race/|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clifford|first1=Catherine|title=In the same way there was a nuclear arms race, there will be a race to build A.I., says tech exec|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/hootsuite-ceo-next-version-of-arms-race-will-be-a-race-to-build-ai.html|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=CNBC|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government has strongly rejected any ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems, suggesting that such a ban could be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia rejects potential UN ‘killer robots’ ban, official statement says|url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/12/russia-rejects-potential-un-killer-robots-ban-official-statement-says/|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]|date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examination of various dimensions of emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems, Russian Federation, November 2017|url=https://admin.govexec.com/media/russia.pdf|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{Further|Artificial intelligence industry in China}}
According to Elsa Kania of the [[Center for a New American Security]], "China is no longer in a position of technological inferiority but rather sees itself as close to catching up with and overtaking the United States in AI. As such, the (Chinese military) intends to achieve an advantage through changing paradigms in warfare with military innovation, thus seizing the 'commanding heights'...of future military competition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. is losing to Russia and China in war for artificial intelligence, report says|url=http://www.newsweek.com/us-could-lose-russia-china-war-artificial-intelligence-726603|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=29 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close ties between Silicon Valley and China, and the open nature of the American research community, has made the West's most advanced AI technology easily available to China; in addition, Chinese industry has numerous home-grown AI accomplishments of its own, such as [[Baidu]] passing a notable Chinese-language speech recognition capability benchmark in 2015.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|title=China’s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/technology/artificial-intelligence-china-united-states.html|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=The New York Times|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, Beijing's roadmap aims to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030.&lt;ref name="financial times"&gt;{{cite news|title=China seeks dominance of global AI industry|url=https://www.ft.com/content/856753d6-8d31-11e7-a352-e46f43c5825d|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2013, Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few conglomerates; however, as of 2017, China often sources sensitive emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from private start-up companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China enlists start-ups in high-tech arms race|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5883d3d2-62cd-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Chinese state has pledged to invest $5 billion in AI.

China published a position paper in 2016 questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons, becoming the first permanent member of the U.N. [[Security Council]] to broach the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robots with Guns: The Rise of Autonomous Weapons Systems|url=https://www.snopes.com/2017/04/21/robots-with-guns/|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=Snopes.com|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2015, the UK government opposed a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, stating that "international humanitarian law already provides sufficient regulation for this area", but that all weapons employed by UK armed forces would be "under human oversight and control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk leads 116 experts calling for outright ban of killer robots|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/20/elon-musk-killer-robots-experts-outright-ban-lethal-autonomous-weapons-war|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
The South Korean [[Sentry gun#Super aEgis II|Super aEgis II]] machine gun, unveiled in 2010, sees use both in South Korea and in the Middle East. It can identify, track, and destroy a moving target at a range of 4&amp;nbsp;km. While the technology can theoretically operate without human intervention, in practice safeguards are installed to require manual input. A South Korean manufacturer states, "Our weapons don't sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can't. Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability", and they want to "get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend, foe, civilian or military".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkin|first1=Simon|title=Killer robots: The soldiers that never sleep|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150715-killer-robots-the-soldiers-that-never-sleep|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=BBC|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China became a top player in artificial intelligence research in the 2010s. According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', in 2016, for the first time, China published more AI papers than the entire European Union. When restricted to number of AI papers in the top 5% of cited papers, China overtook the United States in 2016 but lagged behind the European Union.&lt;ref name="financial times"/&gt; 23% of the researchers presenting at the 2017 [[American Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) conference were Chinese.&lt;ref name=qz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kopf|first1=Dan|title=China is rapidly closing the US’s lead in AI research|url=https://qz.com/1197174/china-is-the-rising-artificial-intelligence-power/|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Quartz|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Schmidt]], the former chairman of [[Alphabet (company)|Alphabet]], has predicted China will be the leading country in AI by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The battle for digital supremacy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21738883-americas-technological-hegemony-under-threat-china-battle-digital-supremacy|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposals for international regulation ==
As early as 2007, scholars such as AI professor [[Noel Sharkey]] have warned of "an emerging arms race among the hi-tech nations to develop autonomous submarines, fighter jets, battleships and tanks that can find their own targets and apply violent force without the involvement of meaningful human decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban on killer robots urgently needed, say scientists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/13/ban-on-killer-robots-urgently-needed-say-scientists|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkey|first1=Noel|title=Noel Sharkey: Robot wars are a reality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/18/comment.military|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2014, AI specialists such as [[Steve Omohundro]] have been warning that "An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=Fearing Bombs That Can Pick Whom to Kill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/science/weapons-directed-by-robots-not-humans-raise-ethical-questions.html|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles Brundage of the [[University of Oxford]] has argued an AI arms race might be somewhat mitigated through diplomacy: "We saw in the various historical arms races that collaboration and dialog can pay dividends".&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|title=AI Could Revolutionize War as Much as Nukes|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-could-revolutionize-war-as-much-as-nukes/|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a hundred experts signed an open letter in 2017 calling on the UN to address the issue of lethal autonomous weapons;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk leads 116 experts calling for outright ban of killer robots|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/20/elon-musk-killer-robots-experts-outright-ban-lethal-autonomous-weapons-war|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Open Letter to the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons|url=https://futureoflife.org/autonomous-weapons-open-letter-2017/|website=Future of Life Institute|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, at a November 2017 session of the UN [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] (CCW), diplomats could not agree even on how to define such weapons.&lt;ref name=asia&gt;{{cite news|title=Rise of the killer machines|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/rise-killer-machines/|date=24 November 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian ambassador and chair of the CCW stated that agreement on rules remained a distant prospect.

== Other reactions to autonomous weapons ==
A 2015 open letter calling for the ban of lethal automated weapons systems has been signed by tens of thousands of citizens, including scholars such as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] magnate [[Elon Musk]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref name=asia/&gt;

Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] has warned that autonomous weapons will inevitably fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wheeler|first1=Brian|title=Terrorists 'certain' to get killer robots|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42153140|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disassociation ==

The primary focus of this article is asynchronous control in digital electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asynchronous Control for Networked Systems|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1EqGCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2015-10-04|isbn = 9783319212999|language = en|first = María Guinaldo|last = Losada|first2 = Francisco Rodríguez|last2 = Rubio|first3 = Sebastián|last3 = Dormido}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Asynchronous Circuit Design: A Systems Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fefgBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2013-04-17|isbn = 9781475733853|language = en|first = Jens|last = Sparsø|first2 = Steve|last2 = Furber}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In a [[synchronous system]], operations ([[Opcode|instructions]], [[Arithmetic logic unit|calculations]], [[Sequential logic|logic]], etc.)  are coordinated by one, or more, centralized [[clock signal]]s.  An asynchronous digital system, in contrast, has no global clock.  Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable operation.   Coordination is achieved via [[Event-driven architecture|events]] such as: [[Network packet|packet]] arrival, changes (transitions) of signals,  handshake protocols, and other methods.

==Modularity==

Asynchronous systems – much like [[object-oriented]] software – are typically constructed out of [[Module (programming)|modular]] 'hardware objects', each with well-defined communication [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s. These [[modularity (programming)|modules]] may operate at variable speeds, whether due to data-dependent processing, [[dynamic voltage scaling]], or [[process variation]]. The modules can then be combined together to form a correct working system, without reference to a global [[clock signal]]. Typically, [[Low-power electronics|low power]] is obtained since components are activated only on demand. Furthermore, several asynchronous styles have been shown  to accommodate clocked interfaces, and thereby support mixed-timing design. Hence, asynchronous systems match well the need for correct-by-construction [[methodology|methodologies]] in assembling large-scale heterogeneous and scalable systems.

==Design styles==

There is a large spectrum of asynchronous design styles, with tradeoffs between robustness and performance (and other parameters such as power). The choice of design style depends on the application target: reliability/ease-of-design vs. speed.  The most robust designs use  '[[Delay insensitive circuit|delay-insensitive circuits]]', whose operation is correct regardless
of [[Delay calculation|gate and wire delays]]; however, only limited useful systems can be  designed with this style.  Slightly less robust, but much more useful, are  [[quasi-delay-insensitive circuit]]s (also known as speed-independent circuits), such as [[delay-insensitive minterm synthesis]], which operate correctly regardless of [[Delay calculation|gate delays]]; however, wires at each [[fanout]] point must be tuned for roughly equal delays.  Less robust but faster circuits, requiring simple localized one-sided [[timing constraints]],  include [[Controller (computing)|controllers]] using fundamental-mode operation (i.e. with setup/hold  requirements on when new inputs can be received), and bundled datapaths using matched delays (see below).  At the extreme, high-performance "timed circuits" have been proposed, which use tight two-side timing constraints, where the [[clock signal|clock]] can still be avoided but careful physical delay tuning is required, such as for some high-speed  [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] applications.

==Asynchronous communication==

[[Asynchronous communication]] is typically performed on [[Channel (communications)|channels]]. Communication is used both to [[synchronize]] operations of the concurrent system as well as to pass data.  A simple channel typically consists  of two wires:  a request and an acknowledge.  In a '4-phase [[handshaking]]  [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]' (or return-to-zero), the request is asserted by the sender component, and the receiver responds by asserting the acknowledge; then both signals are de-asserted in turn.  In a '2-phase [[handshaking]] [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]' (or transition-signalling), the requester simply toggles the value on the request wire (once), and the receiver responds by toggling the value on the acknowledge wire.  Channels can also be extended to communicate data.

==Asynchronous datapaths==

Asynchronous [[datapath]]s are typically encoded using several schemes. Robust schemes use two wires or 'rails' for each bit, called 'dual-rail encoding'.  In this case, first rail is asserted to transmit a 0 value, or the second rail is asserted to transmit a 1 value.  The asserted rail is then reset to zero before the next data value is transmitted, thereby indicating 'no data' or a 'spacer' state.  A less robust, but widely used and practical scheme, is called 'single-[[Rail (electronics)|rail]] bundled data'. Here, a single-rail (i.e. synchronous-style) function block can be used, with an accompanying [[worst-case]] matched delay.  After valid data inputs arrive, a request signal is [[assertion (software development)|asserted]] as the input to the matched delay.  When the matched delay produces a 'done' output, the block guaranteed to have completed computation.  While this scheme has timing constraints, they are simple, localized (unlike in [[synchronous system]]s), and one-sided, hence are usually easy to validate.

==Literature==

The literature in this field exists in a variety of conference and journal proceedings.  The leading symposium is the IEEE Async Symposium (International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems), founded in 1994.   A variety of asynchronous papers have also been published since the mid-1980s in such conferences as IEEE/ACM [[Design Automation Conference]],  IEEE [http://www.iccd-conference.com International Conference on Computer Design], IEEE/ACM [[International Conference on Computer-Aided Design]], [http://www.isscc.org/isscc/ International Solid-State Circuits  Conference], and Advanced Research in VLSI, as well as in leading journals  such as IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems, [[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems]], and Transactions on Distributed Computing.

'''''Beyond This Horizon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. It was originally published as a two-part serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by [[Fantasy Press]] in 1948. It was awarded a [[Retro Hugo]] award for best novel in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo43"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/ |title=1943 Retro Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The novel depicts a world where genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified '[[control group|control naturals]]' are a carefully managed and protected minority. [[Duel]]ing and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic [[utopia]]; the "economic dividend" is so high that [[Post scarcity|work has become optional]]. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.

The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal [[superman|übermensch]]. Felix is the penultimate step in a "star line" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks [[eidetic memory]], which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an "encyclopedic synthesist", one who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life—and the society he lives in—to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of these synthesists seeks him out, inquiring when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure which not only gives him purpose but convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.

Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix is the product of generations of [[genetic engineering]]. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book his genetically engineered son is born. The son is the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] characterized ''Beyond This Horizon'' as among "the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1951, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] reviewed the novel favorably, saying "in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', February 1949, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Japanese visual novel ''[[Eden*]]'', the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|''Beyond This Horizon'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the "Anson McDonald" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15829">'''COBRA''' (or '''CoBrA''') was a European [[avant-garde]] [[art movement|movement]] active from 1948 to 1951. The name was coined in 1948 by [[Christian Dotremont]] from the initials of the members' home cities: [[Copenhagen]] (Co), [[Brussels]] (Br), [[Amsterdam]] (A).

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:'Questioning Children', oil on canvas painting by Karel Appel, 1948, private collection.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'Questioning Children', oil on canvas painting by [[Karel Appel]], 1948, private collection]] --&gt;
During the time of occupation of World War II, the Netherlands had been disconnected from the art world beyond its borders. COBRA was formed shortly thereafter. This international movement of artists who worked experimentally evolved from the criticisms of Western society and a common desire to break away from existing art movements, including "detested" naturalism and "sterile" [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]]. Experimentation was the symbol of an unfettered freedom, which, according to Constant, was ultimately embodied by children and the expressions of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baumgartner |first1=Michael |title=Klee and Cobra: A Child's Play |publisher=Hatje Cantz |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; COBRA was formed by [[Karel Appel]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys|Constant]], [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]], [[Christian Dotremont]], [[Asger Jorn]], and [[Joseph Noiret]] on 8 November 1948 in the Café Notre-Dame, Paris,&lt;ref name="moma.org"&gt;MOMA online [http://moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10954&amp;displayall=1 collections page]&lt;/ref&gt; with the signing of a manifesto, "La cause était entendue" ("The Case Was Settled"),&lt;ref&gt;"La cause était entendue" is an ironical reference to the manifesto "[http://www.andrebreton.fr/Resources/Assets/56600100560650/HR_56600100560650_1.jpg La cause est entendue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110537/http://www.andrebreton.fr/Resources/Assets/56600100560650/HR_56600100560650_1.jpg |date=2011-07-18 }}" (The Case Is Settled) from the supporters of Revolutionary Surrealism&lt;/ref&gt; drawn up by Dotremont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3558757 ''La cause etait entendue'', first version of the CoBrA group's manifesto, 8 November 1948, Yale University Library, Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Formed with a unifying doctrine of complete freedom of colour and form, as well as antipathy towards [[Surrealism]], the artists also shared an interest in [[Marxism]] as well as modernism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Their working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children’s drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of [[Paul Klee]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name="moma.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming together as an amalgamation of the Dutch group Reflex, the Danish group Høst and the Belgian Revolutionary Surrealist Group, the group only lasted a few years but managed to achieve a number of objectives in that time: the periodical ''Cobra'', a series of collaborations between various members called ''Peintures-Mot'' and two large-scale exhibitions. The first of these was held at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam, November 1949, the other at the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Liège (city)|Liège]] in 1951.

In November 1949 the group officially changed its name to Internationale des Artistes Expérimentaux with membership having spread across Europe and the United States, although this name has never stuck. The movement was officially disbanded in 1951, but many of its members remained close, with Dotremont in particular continuing collaborations with many of the leading members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CoBrA Museum |url=http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/cobra.html |location=Cobra Museum, The Netherlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621043026/http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/cobra.html |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of the group consisted of semi-abstract paintings with brilliant color, violent brushwork, and distorted human figures inspired by primitive and folk art and similar to American [[action painting]]. Cobra was a milestone in the development of [[Tachisme]] and European [[abstract expressionism]].

Cobra was perhaps the last avant-garde movement of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stokvis – [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8HpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=COBRA+art+movement&amp;dq=COBRA+art+movement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIl-yRpr_dxgIVQ1wUCh24hQyn Cobra: The Last Avant-garde Movement of the Twentieth Century] Lund Humphries 2004, 349 pages, {{ISBN|0853318980}} [Retrieved 2015-07-15]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nathalie Aubert the group only
lasted officially for three years (1948 to 1951). After that period each artist
in the group developed their own individual paths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Auber, Nathalie. “’Cobra after Cobra’ And The Alba Congress:

=== Manifesto ===

The manifesto, entitled, "''La cause était entendue''" (The Case Was Settled) was written by CoBrA member Christian Dotremont and signed by all founding members in Paris in 1948. It was directly speaking to their experience attending the Centre International de Documentation sur l’Art d’Avant-garde in which they felt the atmosphere was sterile and authoritarian. It was a statement of working collaboratively in an organic mode of experimentation in order to develop their work separate from the current place of the avant-garde movement. The name of the manifesto was also a play on words from an earlier document signed by Belgian and French Revolutionary Surrealists in July 1947, entitled "La cause est entendue" (The Case Is Settled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokvis|first1=Willemijn|title=Cobra: The Last Avant-Garde Movement|date=2004|publisher=Lund Humphries|location=Aldershot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The European artists were different from their American counterparts (the [[Abstract expressionists]]) for they preferred the process over the product and introduced primitive, mythical, and folkloric elements along with a decorative input from their children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cooke, Lynne. “Review.” The Burlington Magazine 126, no. 978 (September 1, 1984): 583.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the new approaches that united the COBRA artists was their unrestrained use of strong colors, along with violent handwritings and figuration which can be either frightening or humorous.  Their art was alive with subhuman figures in order to mirror the terror and weakness of our time unlike the dehumanized art of [[Abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Edith. "Cobra Exhibition in Rotterdam." The Burlington Magazine 108.760 (1966): 388–89. JSTOR. Web. 14 Sept. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This spontaneous method was a rejection of Renaissance art, specialization, and ‘civilized art’, they preferred ‘uncivilized’ forms of expression which created an interplay between the conscious and the unconscious instead of the [[Surrealist]] interest in the unconscious alone. The childlike in their method meant a pleasure in painting, in the materials, forms, and finally the picture itself; this aesthetic notion was called ‘desire unbound’. The Dutch Artists in particular within Cobra (Corneille, Appel, Constant) were interested in Children's art.“We Wanted to start again like a child” Karel Appel insisted.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Appel, from an interview with Eleanor Flomenhaft, October 16, 1975; cited in Flomenhaft 1985, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Western Left, they were built upon the fusion of Art and Life through experiment in order to unite form and expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== CoBrA exhibitions ==
They exhibited mainly in Holland, but also Paris and other countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 875035|title=Cobra Exhibition in Rotterdam |date=July 1966  |journal=The Burlington Magazine |last = Hoffmann |first=Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stedelijk Museum Exhibition===

The first major exhibition was held at the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] in November 1949 under the title "International Experimental Art".

The museum's director and curator [[Willem Sandberg]] was interested in bringing experimentalism and abstraction to The Netherlands, and had also been an active member of the Dutch Resistance during the war. He was deeply involved with the CoBrA group and maintained direct contacts between the artists and the Stedelijk Museum.&lt;ref name="stedelijk.nl"&gt;http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/cobra-the-stedelijk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/willem-sandberg-warm-printing&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Aldo van Eyck]], who would later become known for his architecture of playgrounds as cultural critique, was asked to do the interior design of the exhibition. The close relationship between Van Eyck and the artists from the CoBrA, who also drew their inspiration in particular from children's drawings, makes it probable that much of Eyck's early inspiration for the playgrounds may have derived from CoBrA.&lt;ref name="stichtingconstant.nl"&gt;http://stichtingconstant.nl/cobra-1948-1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://merijnoudenampsen.org/2013/03/27/aldo-van-eyck-and-the-city-as-playground/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stedelijk Museum exhibition gave rise to furious criticism from press and the public. A critic from ''[[Het Vrije Volk]]'' (Free People) wrote, “Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum” (“Smirch, twaddle and mess in the SMA"). The CoBrA artists are considered scribblers and [[con artists]].&lt;ref name="stichtingconstant.nl" /&gt; Newspapers spoke of offensive art and provocation on the part of the artists, and one evening for experimental poetry at the Stedelijk was the occasion for a public brawl.&lt;ref name="stedelijk.nl" /&gt;

=== Exhibition in Liège ===
The last CoBrA exhibit was located in [[Liège]], Belgium, in 1951. Shortly after this exhibit, the group dissolved. The show was organised by [[Pierre Alechinsky]], an artist from Belgium. The Dutch architect, Van Eyck designed the exhibition layout, just as he had for the 1949 CoBrA exhibition in Stedelijk. The innovations of this exhibit were that the composition for the wall was in a  grid formation. In addition, the sculptures, which were featured in this show were on coal beds from the Liege area itself.

This show was not specific to only CoBrA artists, and also, major artists of the CoBrA movement were not in this exhibit due to the existing conflict within the group that eventually led to the collapse of CoBrA shortly after in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V-_iBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cobra+1951+exhibition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NiAIA1neY2&amp;sig=OHUBjMPfxSa5so9ttjvYmWZoVp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwDGoVChMItfTTg4D6xwIVlo6SCh2MagKs#v=onepage&amp;q=cobra%201951%20exhibition&amp;f=false |title=The Art and Politics of Asger Jorn: The Avant-Garde Won't Give Up |date=August 2014 |accessdate= |website=Google Books |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Unlimited |last=Kurczynski |first=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
* [[Alison M.

''The Huffington Post''. Retrieved 2015-09-22]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ernest Mancoba]] (1904–2002), of South Africa, claimed to be one of the only black artists of Cobra. In his own words, Mancoba, a clear supporter of the Cobra movement, criticizes the views of his fellow artists regarding himself: "The embarrassment that my presence caused to the point of making me, in their eyes, some sort of 'Invisible Man' or merely the consort of a European woman artist—was understandable, as before me there had never been to my knowledge any black man taking part in the visual arts 'avant garde' of the Western World."&lt;ref name="Huffington" /&gt;

==Legacy==
There is a Cobra Museum in [[Amstelveen]], Netherlands, displaying works by [[Karel Appel]] and other international avant-garde artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobra-museum.nl/en/ Cobra Museum of Modern Art], Amstelveen&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is known for its large assemblage of works of CoBrA art.  The museum displays works by Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, and Asger Jorn, the movement's leading exponents. (www.nsuartmuseum.org )&lt;from Florida travel book and the museum's website&gt;

Auctioneers Bruun Rasmussen held an auction of COBRA artists on April 3, 2006 in Copenhagen. It set records for the highest price for an [[Asger Jorn]] painting (6.4 million DKK for ''Tristesse Blanche'') and for the highest amount raised in a single auction in Denmark (30 million DKK in total).

A '''canopy seed bank''' or '''aerial seed bank''' is the aggregate of viable [[seed]] stored by a [[plant]] in its [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. Canopy seed banks occur in plants that postpone seed release for some reason.

It is often associated with [[serotiny]], the tendency of some plants to store seed in a [[Conifer cone|cone]] (e.g. in the genus ''[[Pinus]]'') or woody fruits (e.g. in the genus ''[[Banksia]]''), until seed release is triggered by the passage of a [[wildfire]].

It also occurs in plants that colonise areas of shifting sands such as sand dunes. In such cases, the seed is held in the canopy even if the canopy becomes buried; thus the seed is anchored in place until good germination conditions occur.

'''Circles of Sustainability''' is a method for understanding and assessing [[sustainability]], and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as outlined in [[sustainable development]] debates. The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements.

Circles of Sustainability, and its treatment of the social domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture, provides the empirical dimension of an approach called '[[engaged theory]]'. Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life', using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience, adaptation, security, reconciliation. It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' (with World Vision).

The rationale for this new method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672|accessdate=September 9, 2012|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911065400/http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672#|archive-date=11 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more complex the problems, the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Paul James, Andy Scerri, ‘Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach’, Applied Research in the Quality of Life, vol. 7, no. 3., 2012, pp. 239–61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Triple Bottom Line]] approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Andy Scerri, Paul James, Lin Padgham, James Thom, Hepu Deng, Sarah Hickmott, and Felicity Cahill, ‘Reframing Sustainability Reporting: Towards an Engaged Approach’, Environment, Development and Sustainability, vol. 15, no. 1, 2013, pp. 225–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.

==History==
The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality. Two concurrent developments provided impetus: a major project in Porto Alegre, and a United Nations’ paper called ''Accounting for Sustainability'', Briefing Paper, No. 1, 2008. The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCarthy, Paul James and Carolines Bayliss, eds, ''Sustainable Cities, Vol. 1'', United Nations Global Compact, Cities Programme, New York and Melbourne, 2010, 134pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee, and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project&lt;ref&gt;‘Semantic Technologies to Help Machines Understand Us: Fuji Xerox leads RMIT to $1.4m Grant for Real-Time Green Reports’, ''IT Business'', 30 October 2009.

==Use of the method==
The method is used by a series of global organizations including the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, The World Association of Major Metropolises,&lt;ref&gt;The methodology was used by Metropolis for Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the ‘Circles of Sustainability’ methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice. (See http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |date=19 August 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Vision]] to support their engagement in cities. It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles (e.g., Hyderabad, Johannesburg, Melbourne, New Delhi, São Paulo and Tehran). It is a method for understanding [[urban politics]] and [[urban planning]], as well as for conducting [[sustainability]] analysis and profiling [[sustainable development]].

===Global Compact Cities Programme===
The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than 80 Signatory Cities. In particular, some of the 14 Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects, some with intensity and others as a background feature. They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porto Alegre, Vila Chocolatão project====

The Vila Chocolatão project refers to the 2011 resettlement of approximately 1,000 residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolatão slum in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil. The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 in response to an imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown [[participatory budgeting]] system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme. In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.

This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement.  This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.

====Milwaukee, water sustainability project====

In 2009, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Business Journal'', 29 April 2009; John Schmid, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project. In the period of the application of the method (2009–present) there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities/americas/usa/milwaukee |title=Milwaukee - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance, as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500,000. The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/ |title=UN Global Compact &amp;#124; Milwaukee Water Council |work=thewatercouncil.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815005612/http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/# |archive-date=15 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolis (World  Association of the Major Metropolises)===
The methodology was first used by Metropolis for ''Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth''. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions |title=Publications / Commissions &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |archive-date=19 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives. The methodology is central to the approach used by the ‘Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative’ organized by Metropolis, 2012–2013 for Indian, Brazilian and Iranian cities. A workshop was held in New Delhi, 26–27 July 2012, and senior planners from New Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans. Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran (in relation to their mega-projects plan) and São Paulo (in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolis.org/news/metropolis-initiative-integrated--1 |title=Metropolis Initiative "Integrated Strategic Planning and Public Private Partnerships" meets in New Delhi &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities. A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method.

===''The Economist''===
In 2011, ''The Economist'' invited [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme) and Chetan Vedya (Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs, India) into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth. It led to over 200 letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/192 |title=Economist Debates: Cities |work=economist.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision===
In 2011, recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty, [[World Vision]] decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings. Previously 80 per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities. The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India, South Africa, Lebanon, Indonesia and elsewhere, to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings.

==Domains and subdomains==
The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the [[triple bottom line]] that treat economics as if it is outside the social, or that treat the environment as an externality. It uses a four-domain model - economics, ecology, politics and culture. In each of these domains there are 7 subdomains.

===Economics===
The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production, use, and management of resources, where the concept of ‘resources’ is used in the broadest sense of that word.
# Production and resourcing
# Exchange and transfer
# Accounting and regulation
# Consumption and use
# Labour and welfare
# Technology and infrastructure
# Wealth and distribution

===Ecology===
The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms, focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature, but also including the built-environment.
# Materials and energy
# Water and air
# Flora and fauna
# Habitat and settlements
# Built-form and transport
# Embodiment and sustenance
# Emission and waste

===Politics===
The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power, such as organization, authorization, legitimation and regulation. The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general.
# Organization and governance
# Law and justice
# Communication and critique
# Representation and negotiation
# Security and accord
# Dialogue and reconciliation
# Ethics and accountability

===Culture===
The cultural domain is defined as the practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.
# Identity and engagement
# Creativity and recreation
# Memory and projection
# Belief and ideas
# Gender and generations
# Enquiry and learning
# Wellbeing and health

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Circulus''' was a [[socioeconomics]] doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] [[socialist]] [[Pierre Leroux]] (1797-1871), who proposed that human [[excrement]] be collected by the state in the form of a [[tax]] and used as [[fertiliser]], thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

== The theory ==
According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] ''Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux'' [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Revue de l'ordre social'' (No. 1, 1850, p.&amp;nbsp;6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait ''religieusement'' son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).

== Origin and history of the theory ==
Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations'', Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" (Madame, give me dung).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Laporte, ''Histoire de la Merde'', Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite public ridicule,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in ''Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes'' (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: "M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste).&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in [[Jersey]] after the fall of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digression on the sewers of Paris in ''[[Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"L'intestin de Léviathan", Book Five, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is "a misunderstanding" ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a negligent waste ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"), and that were the "givens of a new social economy" ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Misérables'', ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685.&lt;/ref&gt; But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]], who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing "the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Verus Engineering Porsche 987.2 Ventus 2 Package.png|thumb|A simulation of aerodynamic package of a Porsche 987.2 Cayman.]]
'''Computational fluid dynamics''' ('''CFD''') is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]] that uses [[numerical analysis]] and [[data structure]]s to analyze and solve problems that involve [[fluid dynamics|fluid flows]].  Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid ([[Liquid|liquids]] and [[Gas|gases]]) with surfaces defined by [[Boundary value problem#Boundary value conditions|boundary conditions]]. With high-speed [[supercomputer]]s, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as [[transonic]] or [[turbulence|turbulent]] flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as  [[wind tunnel|wind tunnels]].  In addition, previously performed [[Closed-form solution|analytical]] or [[Empirical research|empirical]] analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison.  A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as [[flight test]]s.

CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including [[aerodynamics]] and aerospace analysis, [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulation]], natural science and [[environmental engineering]], industrial system design and analysis, [[biological engineering]] and fluid flows, and [[engine]] and [[combustion]] analysis.

==Background and history==
[[Image:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the [[Space Shuttle]] during re-entry.]]
[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|right|A simulation of the [[Hyper-X]] scramjet vehicle in operation at [[Mach number|Mach]]-7]] The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows.  These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing [[viscous]] actions to yield the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].  Further simplification, by removing terms describing [[vorticity]] yields the [[full potential equation]]s. Finally, for small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]s in subsonic and [[supersonic]] flows (not [[transonic]] or [[hypersonic]]) these equations can be [[Linearization|linearized]] to yield the linearized potential equations.

Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using [[conformal transformation]]s of the flow about a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] to the flow about an [[airfoil]] were developed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milne-Thomson|first=L.M.|authorlink=L. M. Milne-Thomson|title=Theoretical Aerodynamics|year=1973|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-61980-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson's book "Weather prediction by numerical process",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Weather prediction by numerical process|year=1965|publisher=Dover Publications|author=Richardson, L. F.|author2=Chapman, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using [[ENIAC]] used methods close to those in Richardson's 1922 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|title=Lewis Fry Richardson and his contributions to mathematics, meteorology, and models of conflict|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|year=1997|volume=30|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.0|bibcode = 1998AnRFM..30D..13H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer power available paced development of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] methods.  Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, was performed at [[Los Alamos National Lab]], in the T3 group.&lt;ref name=legacy_T3&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legacy of Group T-3|url=https://www.lanl.gov/orgs/t/t3/history.shtml#early|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harlow2004fluid&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harlow|first=F.

Harlow]], who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of CFD. From 1957 to late 1960s, this group developed a variety of numerical methods to simulate transient two-dimensional fluid flows, such as 
[[Particle-in-cell]] method (Harlow, 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Francis H. Harlow|F.H. Harlow]]|title=A Machine Calculation Method for Hydrodynamic Problems|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report LAMS-1956|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper with three-dimensional model was published by John Hess and [[A.M.O. Smith]] of [[Douglas Aircraft]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=J.L.|author2=A.M.O.

Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages.  The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Rubbert, Paul and Saaris, Gary, "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1972-188 Review and Evaluation of a Three-Dimensional Lifting Potential Flow Analysis Method for Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 72-188, presented at the AIAA 10th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, San Diego California, January 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at [[Boeing]] (PANAIR, A502),&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, R. and Erickson, L.L., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1981-1255 PAN AIR - A Higher Order Panel Method for Predicting Subsonic or Supersonic Linear Potential Flows About Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 81-1255, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, Palo Alto California, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (Quadpan),&lt;ref&gt;Youngren, H.H., Bouchard, E.E., Coopersmith, R.M. and Miranda, L.R., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1827 Comparison of Panel Method Formulations and its Influence on the Development of QUADPAN, an Advanced Low Order Method]," AIAA paper 83-1827, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] (HESS),&lt;ref&gt;Hess, J.L. and Friedman, D.M., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1983-1828 Analysis of Complex Inlet Configurations Using a Higher-Order Panel Method]," AIAA paper 83-1828, presented at the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference, Danvers, Massachusetts, July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonnell Aircraft]] (MACAERO),&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D.R., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800007773.pdf Development of Panel Methods for Subsonic Analysis and Design]," NASA CR-3234, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] (PMARC)&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Dale L.; Dudley, Michael R.; Iguchi, Steve K.; Browne, Lindsey and Katz, Joseph, “[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920023178.pdf Potential Flow Theory and Operation Guide for the Panel Code PMARC]”, NASA NASA-TM-102851 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and Analytical Methods (WBAERO,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, F.A., Dvorak, F.A. and Geller, E.W., "[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/782202.pdf A Computer Program for Three-Dimensional Lifting Bodies in Subsonic Inviscid Flow]," USAAMRDL Technical Report, TR 74-18, Ft.

Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel.  The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time.  Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]], and more recently [[wind turbines]].  Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing [[yacht]]s.  The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC,&lt;ref&gt;Pinella, David and Garrison, Peter, “Digital Wind Tunnel CMARC; Three-Dimensional Low-Order Panel Codes,” Aerologic, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is also commercially available.

In the two-dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design.  The codes typically have a [[boundary layer]] analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled.  Professor Richard Eppler of the [[University of Stuttgart]] developed the [http://www.pdas.com/eppler.html PROFILE] code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Eppler, R.; Somers, D. M., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800020753.pdf A Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Low-Speed Airfoils]," NASA TM-80210, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was soon followed by [[MIT]] Professor Mark Drela's [[XFOIL]] code.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, Mark, "[http://www.web.mit.edu/drela/Public/papers/xfoil_sv.pdf XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils]," in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Engineering, No. 54, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work.  PROFILE uses a [[conformal transformation]] method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design.

An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations.  In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code,&lt;ref&gt;Boppe, C.W., "Calculation of Transonic Wing Flows by Grid Embedding," AIAA paper 77-207, presented at the AIAA 15th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Los Angeles California, January 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Charlie Boppe of [[Grumman Aircraft]] in the early 1980s has seen heavy use.

Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at [[transonic]] speeds.  The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and [[Julian Cole]] of Boeing in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Murman, Earll and Cole, Julian, "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flow," AIAA paper 70-188, presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, New York New York, January 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Frances Bauer, [[Paul Garabedian]] and [[David Korn (computer scientist)|David Korn]] of the Courant Institute at [[New York University]] (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, F., Garabedian, P., and Korn, D. G., "A Theory of Supercritical Wing Sections, with Computer Programs and Examples," Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 66, Springer-Verlag, May 1972. {{ISBN|978-3540058076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at [[Grumman Aerospace]] as Grumfoil.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, H. R.; Melnik, R. E., "[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860002735.pdf GRUMFOIL: A computer code for the viscous transonic flow over airfoils]," NASA CR-3806, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antony Jameson]], originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three-dimensional Full Potential code FLO22&lt;ref&gt;Jameson A. and Caughey D., "A Finite Volume Method for Transonic Potential Flow Calculations," AIAA paper 77-635, presented at the Third AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Alburquerque New Mexico, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1975.  Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code,&lt;ref&gt;Samant, S.S., Bussoletti J.E., Johnson F.T., Burkhart, R.H., Everson, B.L., Melvin, R.G., Young, D.P., Erickson, L.L., Madson M.D. and Woo, A.C., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1987-34 TRANAIR: A Computer Code for Transonic Analyses of Arbitrary Configurations]," AIAA paper 87-0034, presented at the AIAA 25th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; which still sees heavy use.

The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows.  The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 code&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, A., Schmidt, W. and Turkel, E., "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.3391&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Numerical Solution of the Euler Equations by Finite Volume Methods Using Runge-Kutta Time-Stepping Schemes]," AIAA paper 81-1259, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics

In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program&lt;ref&gt;Giles, M., Drela, M. and Thompkins, W.T. Jr., "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1985-1530 Newton Solution of Direct and Inverse Transonic Euler Equations]," AIAA paper 85-1530, presented at the Third Symposium on Numerical and Physical Aspects of Aerodynamic Flows, Long Beach, California, January 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis.  This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program.&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. "[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1990-1470 Newton Solution of Coupled Viscous/Inviscid Multielement Airfoil Flows],", AIAA paper 90-1470, presented at the AIAA 21st Fluid Dynamics, Plasma Dynamics and Lasers Conference, Seattle Washington, June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  MSES sees wide use throughout the world.  A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES,&lt;ref&gt;Drela, M. and Youngren H., "A User's Guide to MISES 2.53", MIT Computational Sciences Laboratory, December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Harold "Guppy" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT.

The Navier–Stokes equations were the ultimate target of development.  Two-dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged.  A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]], CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages.

==Methodology==
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.
* During [[preprocessor (CAE)|preprocessing]]
** The [[geometry]] and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]] (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted.
** The [[volume]] occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.
** The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + [[enthalpy]] + radiation + species conservation
** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
* The [[computer simulation|simulation]] is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
* Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

===Discretization methods===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}

The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems.  Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully.  The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]] both admit shocks, and contact surfaces.

Some of the discretization methods being used are:

==== Finite volume method ====

{{Main article|Finite volume method}}

The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in [[Random-access memory|memory]] usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high [[Reynolds number]] turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patankar|first=Suhas V.|authorlink=Suhas Patankar|title=Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid FLow|year=1980|publisher=Hemisphere Publishing Corporation
|isbn=0891165223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier-Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This [[discretization]] guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iiint Q\, dV + \iint F\, d\mathbf{A} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of fluxes (see [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] or [[Navier–Stokes equations]]), &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the control volume element, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the control volume element.

==== Finite element method ====

{{Main article|Finite element method}}

The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids.  However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed:

:&lt;math&gt;R_i = \iiint W_i Q \, dV^e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the equation residual at an element vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, &lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weight factor, and &lt;math&gt;V^{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the element.

==== Finite difference method ====

{{Main article|Finite difference method}}

The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and is simple to program.  It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}+
\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+
\frac{\partial H}{\partial z}=0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of conserved variables, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are the fluxes in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions respectively.

==== Spectral element method ====

{{Main article|Spectral element method}}

Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form &lt;math&gt;v(x,y) = ax+by+cxy+d&lt;/math&gt;. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.
At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time-stepping schemes arise in the scientific world.

==== Boundary element method ====

{{Main article|Boundary element method}}

In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.

==== High-resolution discretization schemes ====

{{Main article|High-resolution scheme}}

High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of [[flux limiters]] to ensure that the solution is [[total variation diminishing]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Turbulence models===

In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled.  For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible.  The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena.  This section lists some commonly used computational models for turbulent flows.

Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy.

In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term.  These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

==== Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ====
{{main article|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

[[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes]] (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new ''apparent stresses'' known as [[Reynolds stresses]]. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.

RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches:

; [[Turbulence modeling|Boussinesq hypothesis]]: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-ε ([[Brian Launder|Launder]] and [[Brian Spalding|Spalding]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Launder|first=B.E.|author2=D.B. Spalding|year=1974|title= The Numerical Computation of Turbulent Flows|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|pages=269–289|doi = 10.1016/0045-7825(74)90029-2|bibcode = 1974CMAME...3..269L|volume=3|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing Length Model ([[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]]),&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=David C.|title=Turbulence Modeling for CFD|year=2006|publisher=DCW Industries, Inc.|isbn=978-1-928729-08-2|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and [[Apollo M. O. Smith|Smith]]).&lt;ref name=wilcox /&gt; The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a "Zero Equation" model because no transport equations are solved; the &lt;math&gt;k-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a "Two Equation" model because two transport equations (one for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and one for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) are solved.
; [[Reynolds stress model]] (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models.  This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS.

====Detached eddy simulation====
{{main article|Detached eddy simulation}}

[[Detached eddy simulation]]s (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.

====Direct numerical simulation====
{{main article|Direct numerical simulation}}

[[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales.  This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive.  The computational cost is proportional to &lt;math&gt;Re^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pope_2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Turbulent Flows|author=Pope, S.B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-59886-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations.

====Coherent vortex simulation====

The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow.&lt;ref name="Farge_2001"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS), A Semi-Deterministic Turbulence Model Using Wavelets

|issue=4
|pages=393–426
|doi=10.1023/A:1013512726409
|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decomposition is done using [[wavelet]] filtering.  The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter.  Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves.  [[Marie Farge|Farge]] and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the &lt;math&gt;-\frac{40}{39}&lt;/math&gt; energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures ([[vortex stretching|vortex tubes]]), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures.  Goldstein and Vasilyev&lt;ref name="Goldstein_2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales.  By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion.

====PDF methods====

[[Probability density function]] (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by [[Thomas S. Lundgren|Lundgren]],&lt;ref name="Lundgren_1969"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Model equation for nonhomogeneous turbulence
|author=Lundgren, T.S.

|volume=12
|issue=3
|year=1969
|pages=485–497
|doi=10.1063/1.1692511|bibcode = 1969PhFl...12..485L }}&lt;/ref&gt; are based on tracking the one-point PDF of the velocity, &lt;math&gt;f_{V}(\boldsymbol{v};\boldsymbol{x},t) d\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the probability of the velocity at point &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; being between &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}+d\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;.  This approach is analogous to the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles.  PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation.  For example, in the context of [[large eddy simulation]], the PDF becomes the filtered PDF.&lt;ref name="Colucci_1998"&gt;{{cite journal

The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a [[Langevin equation]] for subfilter particle evolution.

====Vortex method====
The vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the [[N-body problem]] (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the [[fast multipole method]] (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms.  They are especially well-suited to simulating filamentary motion, such as wisps of smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology;
* It is practically grid-free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES.
* All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required.
* Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible.
* The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time.

====Vorticity confinement method====

{{Main article|Vorticity confinement}}

The [[vorticity confinement]] (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the [[finite difference equation]]. VC is similar to [[shock capturing methods]], where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.

====Linear eddy model====

The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Steven K.|title=Linear Eddy Simulations Of Mixing In A Homogeneous Turbulent Flow|journal=Physics of Fluids|year=1993|volume=5|issue=4|pages=1023|bibcode = 1993PhFl....5.1023M |doi = 10.1063/1.858667 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.

===Two-phase flow===

[[File:Bubble-rising.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of bubble swarm using [[volume of fluid method]]]]

The modeling of [[two-phase flow]] is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the [[Volume of fluid method]], the [[level-set method]] and [[front tracking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hirt|last2=Nichols|first1=C.W.|first2=B.D.|title=Volume of fluid (VOF) method for the dynamics of free boundaries|year=1981|publisher=Journal of Computational Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Unverdi |first1=S.O.|last2=Tryggvason|first2=G.|authorlink2=Gretar Tryggvason|title=A Front-Tracking Method for Viscous, Incompressible, Multi-Fluid Flows|year=1992|publisher=J. Comput. Phys}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass {{According to whom|date=November 2010}}.  This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Solution algorithms===

Discretization in the space produces a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations.  Applying a [[Newton's method#Nonlinear systems of equations|Newton]] or [[Fixed point iteration|Picard]] iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as [[Successive over-relaxation|successive overrelaxation]] or [[Krylov subspace]] methods. Krylov methods such as [[Generalized minimal residual method|GMRES]], typically used with [[Preconditioner|preconditioning]], operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator.

[[Multigrid method|Multigrid]] has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as [[incomplete LU factorization]], [[Additive Schwarz method|additive Schwarz]], and [[Multigrid method|multigrid]] perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Unsteady aerodynamics===
CFD made a major break through in late 70s with the introduction of LTRAN2, a 2-D code to model oscillating airfoils based on [[transonic]] small perturbation theory by Ballhaus and associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history.arc.nasa.gov/hist_pdfs/bio_ballhaus.pdf | format = PDF | title = Bioographies | last = Haigh | first = Thomas | work = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a Murman-Cole switch algorithm for modeling the moving shock-waves.&lt;ref&gt;Murman, E.M. and Cole, J.D., "Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flows", AIAA Journal , Vol 9, No 1, pp. 114–121, Jan 1971. Reprinted in AIAA Journal, Vol 41, No 7A, pp. 301–308, July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was extended to 3-D with use of a rotated difference scheme by  AFWAL/Boeing that resulted in LTRAN3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.3160270302/abstract | title = Iterative solution of transonic flows over airfoils and wings, including flows at mach 1 | last = Jameson | first = Antony | publisher = Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics | doi = 10.1002/cpa.3160270302 | date = October 13, 2006 | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borland, C.J., “XTRAN3S - Transonic Steady and Unsteady Aerodynamics for Aeroelastic Applications,”AFWAL-TR-85-3214, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, January, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomedical engineering===

[[File:Vel-Streamline-FC.jpg|thumb|right|Simulation of blood flow in a human [[aorta]]]]
CFD investigations are used to clarify the characteristics of aortic flow in detail that are otherwise invisible to experimental measurements. To analyze these conditions, CAD models of the human vascular system are extracted employing modern imaging techniques. A 3D model is reconstructed from this data and the fluid flow can be computed. Blood properties like Non-Newtonian behavior and realistic boundary conditions (e.g.  systemic pressure) have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, making it possible to analyze and optimize the flow in the cardiovascular system for different applications.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, T.A.S., Graefe, R., Hormes, M., Schmitz-Rode, T. and Steinseiferand, U., "Computational Fluid Dynamics in Biomedical Engineering", Computational Fluid Dynamics: Theory, Analysis and Applications , pp. 109–136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CPU versus GPU ===
Traditionally, CFD simulations are performed on CPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=central processing unit|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_9750|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a more recent trend, simulations are also performed on GPU's&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Graphics processing unit|date=2018-06-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graphics_processing_unit&amp;oldid=847182694|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These typically contain slower but more processors. For CFD algorithms that feature good parallellisation performance (i.e. good speed-up by adding more cores) this can greatly reduce simulation times. Lattice-Boltzmann methods are a typical example of codes that scale well on GPU's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/intersect-360-HPC-application-support.pdf|title=Intersect 360 HPC application Support|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">A '''corporate university''' is any educational entity that is a strategic tool designed to assist its parent organization in achieving its goals by conducting activities that foster individual and organizational learning and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Mark|title=The Corporate University Handbook|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|date=2002|pages=9|isbn=978-0-8144-0711-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in [[corporation]]s. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]], [[Boeing]], and [[Motorola]].&lt;ref name="Hearn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/OrgTheory/Hearn721.html|title=Education in the Workplace: An Examination of Corporate University Models |last=Hearn|first=Denise R.|date=2002-05-10|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour&lt;ref&gt; Marginson and Considine, 2000, https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-University-Governance-Reinvention-Australia/dp/052179448X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528155796&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=simon+marginson&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In most cases, corporate universities are not [[University|universities]] in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the [[United States]], a nation which has no official legal definition of the term "university". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the [[Hamburger University]] operated by [[McDonald's Corporation]] in [[Chicago]].

==Typical goals of a corporate university==
Corporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:&lt;ref name="Hearn"/&gt;
*Bring a common culture, loyalty, and belonging to a company
*Get the most out of the investment in education
*Organize training
*Remain competitive in today's economy
*Retain employees 
*Start and support change in the organization

CUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.

==Curriculum==
[[J.P. Morgan]] and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2003/07/28/focus2.html?page=1|title=Corporate university approach taking hold|last=Tanner|first=Lisa|date=2003-07-25|publisher=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). 

Most CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. 

Unlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.

==Implementation==
Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/training-roi-walmart-success-stéphane-pineau/|title=Training ROI- the Walmart success|last=Pineau|first=Stephane|date=2016-12-07|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21651217-more-firms-have-set-up-their-own-corporate-universities-they-have-become-less-willing-pay|title=Keeping it on the company campus|date=2015-05-15|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To manage this complexity, specific [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a [[Training management system]]. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of [[Educational Technology| learning technologies]] can be used together.

'''Dependency need''' is "the vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth." (Segen, 1992)  A dependency need is thought to be characterized by two components: (1) It is a real need of an organism, something that must be present in order for the organism to be able to thrive, (2) It is something that an individual cannot provide for him or herself.  It is well known that [[infant]]s have many dependency needs; some of these needs are obvious, others have only come to the attention of researchers as the result of [[epidemiological]] studies.  The more obvious needs of infants include: adequate feeding, adequate watering, adequate cleaning, adequate shelter, and more specifically, keeping the infant's body temperature within the narrow range of normalcy. On the other hand, it was not well known until the middle of the 20th century that infants also required the presence of warmth and affection, known as "[[maternal]] warmth".  The greatest number of dependency needs seem to be encompassed in infancy, however, dependency needs begin to change and decrease with age and [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]]. This marked decrease in dependency needs as an individual gets older can be largely attributed to the notion that, as an individual gets older, he or she becomes capable of providing these things for him or herself. However, to some extent, these needs remain present even into adulthood. Even as adults, people have certain universal dependency needs that remain constant throughout the lifespan that they are not able to provide for themselves; these include: the [[belongingness|need to belong]], need for affection, as well as the need for emotional support.   These needs can usually be met by partnership, in which both partners get used to depending on one another. If adults lack partnership, their needs can usually be met by family and/or friend relationships.

==Importance ==

Dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassing the fields of [[psychological]], [[evolutionary]], and [[ethological]] theory.  [[Need]], in general, is a concept greatly studied in varying psychological fields, by psychologists with varying specialties.  Need is particularly important to the area of [[personality psychology]].  The concept of need can be defined as a "state of tension within a person", and as the need is satisfied, the state of tension is reduced. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that all individuals have needs, and that needs organize perceptions, guiding individuals to see what they want (or need) to see (Larsen &amp; Buss).  A physical or psychological need is capable of organizing action by compelling an individual to do what is necessary in order to fulfill such a need. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  After action has been taken to fulfill the need, the need subsides until it is again desired and recurs.

== History ==

It can be hypothesized that the concept of dependency need originated from the well-known psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and [[Abraham Maslow]]'s ideas about needs.  According to Murray, a need can be defined as a "potentiality or readiness to respond in a certain way under certain circumstances." (Murray, 1938)  Murray purposed a list of [[fundamental human needs]].  Each need was thought to be associated with "(1) a specific desire or intention, (2) a particular set of emotions, and (3) specific action tendencies." (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Murray believed that human beings had their own [[hierarchy of needs]], unique to each individual. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that each individual's various needs exist at different levels of strength.

According to Maslow, the concept of need can be defined primarily by an individual's [[goal]]s. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow was a firm believer of [[self-actualization]], the process of becoming "more and more what one idiosyncratically is, becoming everything that one is capable of becoming." (Larson &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow believed that needs were hierarchically organized, with more basic needs found toward the bottom of the hierarchy and the self-actualization need at the top.  The needs defined by Murray and Maslow (physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness needs, esteem needs, self-actualization needs) seem to correspond with the vital needs encompassed in the concept of dependency need.

== Attachment theory's relevance ==

Dependency needs can sometimes be associated with [[Attachment Theory]].  Attachment can be defined as a "deep and enduring emotional bond that connects one person to another across time and space." (Ainsworth, 1973; Bowlby, 1969)  Attachment is thought to first occur between an infant and his or her primary caregiver. (Hetherington &amp; Parke, 1999)  [[Harry Harlow]] and his research in [[developmental psychology]] showed that attachment between infant and caregiver is vitally important to the [[psychological development]] of the infant and requires physical contact with a warm and responsive mother. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  These early experiences and reactions of the infants to the primary caregivers become working models for later adult relationships. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Therefore, conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Three different types of attachment styles, securely attached, avoidantly attached, and ambivalent attached, can result from varying levels and styles of care a primary caregiver provides an infant.

== Further breakdown ==

Dependency needs can be categorized into biological needs and social needs.

=== Biological needs ===

Biological needs are basic survival needs, such as protection from harm, consumption of food, and regulation of body temperature; they are mechanisms used to promote and maintain proper body functioning.

=== Social needs ===

Social needs are "acquired psychological processes that activate emotional responses to particular need-relevant incentives." (Reeve, 2009)  Need for eye contact, expression of positive emotions by caretakers or loved ones, and cuddling—anything that fosters a sense of [[emotional security]]—can be defined as a social need.  There are four basic social needs: '''power''', '''achievement''', '''intimacy''', and '''affiliation.'''  People who have [[need for power|power needs]] look to gain dominance, achieve high statuses, and/or achieve high positions in their occupations, households, or social groups or organizations. These people look for leadership roles, and are usually happy and content when they are in control.  People who have [[need for achievement|achievement needs]] are willing to seek out and accomplish tasks.  The strive for achievement can develop strongly in children when influenced by their parents. Intimacy needs are linked to affiliation needs.  Intimacy needs can be sought out and met when in close, personal relationships with others. Fulfillment of intimacy needs can help decrease an individual's chance of developing onset of depression, as well as help reduce an individual's fears of being rejected.  [[need for affiliation|Affiliation needs]] are people's needs to feel a sense of involvement and "belonging" within a social group; affiliation needs have to do more with the acceptance of behavior.  It is [[human nature]] for people to want to be liked by others and get approval from them.  It is also innate for people to want to maintain healthy and positive relationships with others around them.

=== Key contributors ===

There have been numerous theorists who have done research in relation to dependency need.

'''Robert Bornstein''', a professor of psychology, researched certain levels of dependency needs, as well as [[personality disorder]]s related to dependency needs, including [[dependent personality disorder]] (DPD) and [[histrionic personality disorder]] (HPD).  Henry Murray's publication, Explorations in Personality (1938) describes differences and similarities between types of dependency needs.

As mentioned previously, [[Abraham Maslow]] was a key contributor to the establishment of a dependency need theory.  His need theory, [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]], is thought to help a person achieve the unsatisfied needs of one's self.  In his hierarchy, he outlined five needs crucial to [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and happiness across the lifespan; they are thought to occur in stages.  The five stages include, physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are needs that everyone has to have in order to survive, such as air, food, water, and sleep.  After a person has attained these physiological needs, he or she then focuses his or her attention to safety needs. Safety needs help an individual feel secure in order to make him or her feel safe, physically and emotionally. An example of this can be seen in people's choices of where they choose to live and work, and attaining medical insurance.  After safety needs are met, social needs are the focus of attention.  Social needs have to do with interactions with others (friends, family, romantic partners) and receiving love. After these needs have been met, one's self-esteem needs begin to arise. Esteem needs can be both internal and external. Having and achieving self-respect, receiving attention, and accomplishing achievements are examples of self-esteem needs. After one succeeds in the area of [[self-esteem]], [[self-actualization]] needs are to be met. One's full potential as a person, his or her ''self-actualization'', helps him or her keep developing as a person throughout the lifespan. (Maslow, 2002)

Another key contributor to the establishment of dependency need theory was Sigmund Freud's theory of [[psychosexual development]].

'''Freud's theory of psychosexual development'''

[[Sigmund Freud]] came up with a five-stage theory that stated human beings are born with sexual energy; this energy was thought to develop in five stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages). The first stage, the [[oral stage]], occurs from birth to 2 years of age.  The key component of the oral stage is the child's fascination with his or her mouth, more specifically, putting items into his or her mouth, breast feeding, etc. The child is thought to get great pleasure from such objects being placed in his or her mouth. The second stage, the [[anal stage]], occurs from 18 months of age to 3 years. In this stage, the child's main focus is on his or her anus, and the experience of toilet training is thought to be quite pleasurable. The third phase, the [[phallic stage]], occurs from 3 years of age to 6 years of age. In this stage, the main focus of the child is on discovering his or her genital region. Children become more aware of their own bodies, the bodies of other children, as well as their parents' bodies. Children also become aware of anatomical sex differences between male and female genitalia.  Freud believed during this stage, that boys had the idea that they needed to compete with their fathers in order to possess their mothers.  He also believed that girls felt penis envy towards males, and therefore blamed their mothers for not having a penis; the girls then competed for psychosexual possession of their fathers. The fourth stage, the [[latency stage]], occurs from 6 years of age until the child reaches puberty.  In this stage, children are thought to be "latent" of sexual energies, however sexual urges still remain. During this time, children play with the same sex friends.  The final stage in psychosexual development is the [[genital stage]], occurring from puberty through the rest of adulthood.  In this stage, individuals focus on detaching from their parents, doing their own thing and not relying as much on their parents. In this stage, genitalia is the main focus and sexual energy and urges are normal. The person's concern is now focused on mature, adult friendships and family relationships, as well as intimate relationships, and adult responsibilities. (Basic, 2011)

There are differences and similarities worth noting when it comes to biological needs and social needs. Biological needs are required for survival in everyday life, whereas social needs are acquired and learned. Similarities between the two include the relevance that an individual requires both types of needs in one's life in order to live happy, healthy lives in which he or she is able to thrive and succeed; if an individual's needs are not met, he or she may become sad and/or depressed.

== What happens when dependency needs are not met ==

A person's vital needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth are ever so important to an individual.  If these dependency needs are not met, particularly when an individual is younger, emotional, psychological, as well as physical problems may result down the road. Also, [[mental retardation]] or even death can result in extreme cases of neglect of dependency needs (usually in cases when biological needs are neglected). In general, depression, sadness, and loneliness are likely results if dependency needs are not met no matter what age an individual is.

== Key experiments ==

Many experiments relating the importance of dependency need have been conducted over the years; here, three influential experiments are outlined.

=== Harry Harlow monkey experiment ===
[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) (5780783616).jpg|thumb|upright|Harlow exclusively used rhesus macaques in his experiments.]]

When this study was conducted in 1957, [[Harry Harlow]] was questioning current theories about dependency and love. At this time, Harlow and his team stated that love began developing as a feeding bond between an infant and its mother; this notion applied to family members, as well. It was also thought that humans, along with other social animals, lived in organized societies in order to regularize sexual contact. Harlow, being fascinated with the concept of love and nurturing, worked with monkeys to test these theories. (Berger, 2005)

In Harlow's monkey experiment, newborn monkeys were separated from their mothers almost immediately after birth. They were then raised with substitute "mothers" made of either (1) wire or (2) wood covered with a soft cloth. In one of the experiments, both the wire and wood mothers were presented to the infant monkey in the same cage, and only one wore a nipple, which the infant was able to nurse from. Some of the monkeys nursed from the wire mother, and others from the cloth mother. According to Berger, Harlow found that even when the wire mother was the source of food the infant monkey spent more of its time with the cloth surrogate. Harlow also found that the cloth mother provided not only food to the infant monkeys, but also was able to provide comfort and security for them.  The interpretation made by Harlow about this was that the liking for the cloth surrogate mother showed the importance of [[affection]], emotion, nurturance, and dependency in mother child relationships.

=== René Spitz orphan study ===

The phenomenon of infant dependency need was first noticed in [[René Spitz]]'s orphan study.  It was during this study that researchers learned of the higher mortality rates for infants maintained in [[orphanage]]s. When the obvious factors such as inadequate [[nutrition]], contagious [[disease]]s, etc., were ruled out, researchers discovered that mortality rates could be greatly ameliorated by having the nurses in charge of the infants in the orphanages [[cuddle]] them in a way that approximated the amount of cuddling infants would normally receive from their own [[parent]]s.

Spitz's orphan study focused on two groups of children, starting when the children were infants, and continued all the way until they reached 12 years of age. The first group of children were raised in an orphanage; the children in this group only received minimal care, let alone any special, one-on-one time with a caregiver. In the second group, each infant received individual care from various women caregivers serving a prison sentence; these caregivers were with the children for the first year of their lives. When the children in each group turned two years old, dramatic differences occurred between them.

Results from the experiment showed drastic differences. It was found that children raised in the orphanage, whom had received minimal care, had less developmental progress than children raised in the prison. Only 26 kids could walk, and only a few could talk. Some of the orphanage kids had signs of mental retardation and were psychologically and socially underdeveloped for their age. Whereas in the prison group, most all the children had reached the point of full development for their age division.

Defined previously, dependency needs are "The vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, [[affection]], shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth" (Segen, 1992). When those needs are not met psychological, emotional, physical and attachment problems can arise. This was shown in the Spitz orphan study. (Shepard, 2013)

=== Types of attachment ===

"[[Attachment theory]] states that a child's first relationship is a love relationship that will have profound, long-lasting effects on an individual's subsequent development." (Colin, 1991) The closeness of the child to the person providing protection and a sense of [[security]] will becomes this figure to the child. This figure lays the foundation for the child to be able to form other secure relationships in the future.  There are four main types of attachment, including: secure, anxious/avoidant, anxious/ambivalent and disorganized/disoriented.

In securely attached babies, the baby's attachment figure is an effective secure base from them. They are able to explore the world and can even handle brief separation in an environment unfamiliar to them. They are secure in the fact that they know the attachment figure will return and that there is little to no anxiety experienced. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/avoidant attachment, the baby is [[anxious]] about the attachment figure's (typically a parent) responsiveness. The baby then develops a defensive strategy for managing his or her own anxiety. The baby experiencing this situation has very little, to no confidence in relation to being responded to; so when the baby seeks care, the child expects to be rejected. For example, if the baby is hungry, he or she will not tell anyone/cry because he or she doesn't expect anyone to meet this need. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/ambivalent attachment, signs of [[anxiety]], anger, and mixed feelings about the attachment figure are present in the baby; this is especially true after brief separations of the baby from the attachment figure, occurring in unfamiliar environments. (Colin, 1991)

In disorganized/disoriented babies, the baby does not have a consistent strategy for managing separation and reunion with his or her attachment figure. Some of the babies show to be depressed, demonstrate avoidant behavior, express anger, and/or show disturbing behaviors. Infants in this category have typically been [[child abuse|maltreated]]. (Colin, 1991)

== Today and future ==

=== Current research ===

The research currently being done in the last few years in relation to dependency need relates largely to [[attachment theory]].  Most studies of attachment theory focus on how attachment relates to other aspects in the individual's life; for example, how an individual's attachment style (developed early on) affects his or her display of emotions after a break-up, or how an individual's attachment style affects his or her ability to make new friends in college.

A study done in 2010 by Stephanie Parade, Esther Leerke, and Nayena Blankson looked at the correlation between an individual's attachment to his or her parents and how well he or she is able to make friends; this study specifically focused on college-age individuals. The study also looked at [[social anxiety]] as the mediator.  The results of this study show that the more securely attached a person is to his or her parents; the easier it is for him or her to make friends.  These findings are consistent to Bowlby's proposition. The authors also found that social anxiety only showed up in the minority. The participants in the minority group had less social anxiety when they had a secure relationship with their parents, which in turn helped them be more sociable overall. (Parade, Leerke, &amp; Blankson, 2010)

Another current study done by Gnilka, Ashby, and Noble, looked at "adult attachment styles and the psychological outcomes, like hopelessness and [[life satisfaction]], using maladaptive and [[adaptive]] perfectionism as the mediators." (Gnika, Ashby, &amp;  Noble, 2013) The results show that having high levels of avoidant or anxiety attachment will cause low maladaptive perfectionism, which overall makes one more likely to have low life satisfaction and high levels of hopelessness. These findings can benefit counselors when working with patients who have problems with [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].

==== Relationship to female suicide attempts ====

Not a whole lot of research is going on in this field today.  One article, done in 1995, looked at female suicide and dependency needs. The focus of the article was on the dependency needs of female adolescent suicide attempters and non-attempters. It also looked at other social network and intimate relationships for both suicide attempters and non-attempters. The authors hypothesized that dependency needs would be higher in suicide attempters. The results displayed a similarity in both groups, although, the sample size was too small to generalize to attempters. The article suggests future research on the range of dependency and the effect dependency might have on suicide. (Beettridge &amp; Favreau, 1995)

=== Viability ===

In the last decade, research on the topic of dependency need has been declining.  The theory of dependency need has largely been incorporated into [[attachment theory]].

== Conclusions ==

Vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth, more specifically known as "dependency needs", change and decrease with age and maturity. As an individual gets older, these needs usually decrease in strength and can normally be met individually, or fulfilled by relationships among partners, family members or friends.

By looking at historical research pioneered by Murray, Maslow, Freud, and Harlow, as well as more recent concepts developed by Spritz, Colin, Parade et al., Beettridge &amp; Favreau, one can determine that dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassed in many areas of psychology.  Throughout time, the basic needs related to safety, love, affection, and protection have seemed to be a subject of utmost importance.  No matter the way one theorizes the concept of dependency need, it is well known that all humans seem to have these basics needs.  It is also known that if these needs are somehow not adequately met, the person who has been neglected in this way, will likely suffer deep-seated emotional, psychological, and possibly even physical hardships.

Today, the concept of dependency need is largely interrelated with the concept of attachment theory. Nowadays, a lot of attachment theory studies are interested in seeing if there is a relationship between a person's style of attachment (developed in infancy) and the way in which he or she deals with whatever life throws his or her way (years later); i.e., dealing with emotions after a break-up or making friendships in college. Conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Attachment theory can also go beyond infancy to look at how early interactions have shaped an individual's personality, and how he or she deals with life situations years and years down the road.  Dependency need continues to be a concept that is of great interest to psychologists (more specifically tied into attachment theory) and is ever-present in the everyday lives of all human beings.

'''Desertification''' is a type of [[land degradation]] in which a relatively [[drylands|dry]] area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife .&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2"&gt;Geist (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through [[climate change]] (particularly the current [[global warming]])&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Ning|last2=Yoon|first2=Jinho|date=1 September 2009|title=Expansion of the world's deserts due to vegetation-albedo feedback under global warming|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=36|issue=17|page=L17401|doi=10.1029/2009GL039699|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2009GeoRL..3617401Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the [[overexploitation]] of soil through human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v0265e/v0265e01.htm|title=Sustainable development of drylands and combating desertification|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual "soil death" can be spoken of,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102180358/http://ca.figu.org/the-desert-will-win.html|title=The Desert Will Win|website=FIGU-Landesgruppe Canada|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces its cause back to human overexploitation.

==Definitions==
Considerable controversy exists over the proper definition of the term "desertification" for which Helmut Geist (2005) has identified more than 100 formal definitions. The most widely accepted&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p2" /&gt; of these is that of the [[Princeton University]] Dictionary which defines it as "the process of fertile land transforming into desert typically as a result of [[deforestation]], drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.sg/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define:desertification#hl=en&amp;q=desertification&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HWuXT-GGL8_NrQeTvq26AQ&amp;ved=0CCwQkQ4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=83aa6ed19b0ba29e&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809|title=define:desertification – Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Desertification has been neatly defined in the text of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/Pages/Text-Part-I.aspx|title=Part I|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to the controversy comes from the sub-grouping of types of desertification. Spanning from the very vague yet shortsighted view as the "man-made-desert" to the more broad yet less focused type as the "Non-pattern-Desert"&lt;ref&gt;Helmut J. Geist, and Eric F. Lambin. "Dynamic Causal Patterns of Desertifcation." BioScience 54.9 (2004): 817 . Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the [[French colonization]] of [[West Africa]], when the Comité d'Etudes commissioned a study on ''desséchement progressif'' to explore the prehistoric expansion of the Sahara Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mortimore, Michael|title=Adapting to drought: farmers, famines, and desertification in west Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-32312-3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's most noted [[deserts]] have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts are large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]], the largest hot desert.&lt;ref name="Desertification"&gt;United States Geological Survey, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/ "Desertification"], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification has played a significant role in human history, contributing to the collapse of several large empires, such as Carthage, Greece, and the Roman Empire, as well as causing displacement of local populations.&lt;ref name="Geist-2005-p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"&gt;{{cite web|last=LOWDERMILK|first=W C|title=CONQUEST OF THE LAND THROUGH SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1043789.pdf|work=Soil Conservation Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitford, Walter G.|title=Ecology of desert systems|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-747261-4|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ4hZbXS8IcC&amp;pg=PA277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski (2011), Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella, Policy Studies Organization (PSO), Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geist|first=Helmut|title=The causes and progression of desertification|url=https://books.google.com/?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=desertification+and+its+effect+on+ancient+civilisations#v=onepage&amp;q=desertification%20and%20its%20effect%20on%20ancient%20civilisations&amp;f=false|work=Antony Rowe Ltd|publisher=Ashgate publishing limited|accessdate=6 July 2013|isbn=9780754643234|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical evidence shows that the serious and extensive land deterioration occurring several centuries ago in arid regions had three epicenters: the Mediterranean, the Mesopotamian Valley, and the [[Loess Plateau]] of China, where population was dense.&lt;ref name="LOWDERMILK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dregne|first=H.E.|title=Desertification of Arid Lands|url=http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-193/002-193.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drylands occupy approximately 40–41% of Earth’s land area&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mR3E4xJFNw0C&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson-1"&gt;Johnson et al (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=da6vhzHEpf0C&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and are home to more than 2 billion people.&lt;ref name="johnson-1" /&gt; It has been estimated that some 10–20% of drylands are already degraded, the total area affected by desertification being between 6 and 12 million square kilometres, that about 1–6% of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified areas, and that a billion people are under threat from further desertification.&lt;ref name="holtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/cop/cop8/docs/parl-disc.pdf|title=UNCCD – Error 404 – Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Bank|title=Gender in agriculture sourcebook|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8213-7587-7|page=454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxBrq6hTs_UC&amp;pg=PA454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1998, the then-current degree of southward expansion of the [[Sahara]] was not well known, due to a lack of recent, measurable expansion of the desert into the Sahel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/~alesall/ouagaCILSS/articles/sen_bams1998.pdf | title=IRI – International Research Institute for Climate and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of global warming and human activities are presented in the Sahel. In this area, the level of desertification is very high compared to other areas in the world. All areas situated in the eastern part of Africa (i.e. in the Sahel region) are characterized by a dry climate, hot temperatures, and low rainfall (300–750&amp;nbsp;mm rainfall per year). So, droughts are the rule in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Desertification/desertification2.php|title=Defining Desertification : Feature Articles|last=Riebeek|first=Holli|date=2007-01-03|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000&amp;nbsp;km² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 years. The propagation of desertification in this area is considerable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savezvousque.fr/monde/progression-desert-sahara-augmente-annee.html|title=La progression du désert du Sahara augmente chaque année ?|website=Savezvousque.fr|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some statistics have shown that since 1900 the Sahara has expanded by 250&amp;nbsp;km to the south over a stretch of land from west to east 6,000&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecke|first=Geoffrey Van|title=Humanum 3, le secret d'Épidaure: suivi de Amazone City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89u9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Mon Petit Éditeur|isbn=978-2-7483-9214-2|page=192|quote=D'après Monique Mainguet, depuis 1900, le Sahara a progressé vers le sud de 250 kilomètres et ce sur un front qui en fait plus de 6000 km.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Bouquet|title=Le Sahara entre ses deux rives.

The loss of topsoil means that plants cannot take root firmly and can be uprooted by torrential water or strong winds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/30/united-nations-convention-to-combat-desertification-issues-and-challenges/|title=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification: Issues and Challenges|website=E-International Relations|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Convention (UNC) says that about six million Sahelian citizens would have to give up the desertified zones of sub-Saharan Africa for North Africa and Europe between 1997 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another major area that is being impacted by desertification is the [[Gobi Desert]]. Currently, the Gobi desert is the fastest moving desert on Earth; according to some researchers, the Gobi Desert swallows up over 1,300 square miles (3,370&amp;nbsp;km²) of land annually. This has destroyed many villages in its path. Currently, photos show that the Gobi Desert has expanded to the point the entire nation of Croatia could fit inside its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html?_r=0 | title=Living in China's Expanding Deserts| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is causing a major problem for the people of China. They will soon have to deal with the desert as it creeps closer. Although the Gobi Desert itself is still a distance away from Beijing, reports from field studies state there are large sand dunes forming only 70&amp;nbsp;km (43.5&amp;nbsp;mi) outside the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/371c/project/2009/Welker_Desertification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation patterning==
As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as "[[Tiger bush|Brousse tigrée]]". A mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klausmeier|first=Christopher|title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|issue=5421|pages=1826–1828|doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15182754,00.html|title=Grid of straw squares turns Chinese sand to soil – Environment – DW.COM – 23.06.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Geeson, Nichola|title=Mediterranean desertification: a mosaic of processes and responses|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-470-84448-9|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_0qg0f49GQC&amp;pg=PA58|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.

Many scientists think that one of the most common causes is [[overgrazing]], too much consumption of vegetation by cattle. Controversially, [[Allan Savory]] has claimed that the controlled movement of herds of livestock, mimicking herds of grazing wildlife, can reverse desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Holistic resource management: a conceptual framework for ecologically sound economic modelling|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|work=Ecological Economics|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523200348/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jody|title=Holistic Management Handbook: Healthy Land, Healthy Profits, Second Edition|year=2006|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1559638852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Response to request for information on the "science" and "methodology" underpinning Holistic Management and holistic planned grazing|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=10 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523074713/http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drury|first1=Steve|title=Large-animal extinction in Australia linked to human hunters|url=http://earth-pages.co.uk/2012/04/13/large-animal-extinction-in-australia-linked-to-human-hunters/|publisher=Earth-Pages|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists agree, that there is a natural cause for the existence of desert in the place where is now the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]]: a natural climate cycle cause a lack of water in this area from time to time. There is a suggestion that the last time that the Sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to overgrazing by the cattle of the local population.&lt;ref name="Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=K.

One of the causes of desertification in the 20th-21st centuries is probably [[Global warming|climate change]]&lt;ref name="Zeng L17401"/&gt;

==Poverty==
At least 90% of the inhabitants of drylands live in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions.&lt;ref name="holtz" /&gt; This situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity, the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;
Dobie, Ph. 2001. “Poverty and the drylands”, in Global Drylands Imperative, Challenge paper, Undp, Nairobi (Kenya) 16 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by [[overgrazing]], [[land exhaustion]] and [[overdrafting]] of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming. Decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential. This absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones. When unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets, as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population, most such zones are excluded from development.&lt;ref name="csf-desertification.org"&gt;[http://www.csf-desertification.org/index.php/bibliotheque/doc_details/119-cornet-antoine-2002-desertification-and-its-relationship-to-the-environment-and-development Cornet A., 2002.

Desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there. This results in mass [[human migration|migrations]] out of rural areas and into urban areas, particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in [[slums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Pasternak, Dov &amp; Schlissel, Arnold|title=Combating desertification with plants|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-46632-8|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-i8-DPf6xgC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture is a main source of income for many desert communities. The increase in desertification in theses regions has degraded the land enough where people can no longer productively farm and make a profit. This has negatively impacted the economy and increased poverty rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Lindsay C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Jen C.|last3=Reed|first3=Mark S.|last4=Dougill|first4=Andrew J.|last5=Twyman|first5=Chasca|last6=Mkwambisi|first6=David|title=Adaptations to climate change, drought and desertification: local insights to enhance policy in southern Africa|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=12|issue=7|pages=748–765|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2009.04.002|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques and countermeasures exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification, and some possess varying levels of difficulty. For some, there are numerous barriers to their implementation. Yet for others, the solution simply requires the exercise of human reason.

One less difficult solution that has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Overpopulation_Crusade#Required_Worldwide_Measures|title=The Future Of Mankind – A Billy Meier Wiki – Overpopulation Crusade|website=www.futureofmankind.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; however controversial it may be, is to bring about a cap on the population growth, and in fact to turn this into a population decay, so that each year there will gradually exist fewer and fewer humans who require the land to be depleted even further in order to grow their food.

One proposed barrier is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers, even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drost|first1=Daniel|last2=Long|first2=Gilbert|last3=Wilson|first3=David|last4=Miller|first4=Bruce|last5=Campbell|first5=William|title=Barriers to Adopting Sustainable Agricultural Practices|issue=6|url=https://www.joe.org/joe/1996december/a1.php|journal=Journal of Extension|volume=34|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is a lack of political will, and lack of funding to support [[land reclamation]] and anti-desertification programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification is recognized as a major threat to [[biodiversity]]. Some countries have developed [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to counter its effects, particularly in relation to the protection of endangered [[flora]] and [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Techniques for Desert Reclamation by Andrew S. Goudie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html Desert reclamation projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172821/http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html |date=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reforestation]] gets at one of the root causes of desertification and is not just a treatment of the symptoms. Environmental organizations&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://edenprojects.org/ Eden Reforestation Projects website], [https://vimeo.com/edenprojects on Vimeo], on {{YouTube|id=edenreforest|title=''Eden Reforestation Projects''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme [[poverty]]. There they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings, which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] launched the FAO [http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/ Drylands Restoration Initiative] in 2012 to draw together knowledge and experience on dryland restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drylands Restoration Initiative|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, FAO published global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands, in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs and the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-108912-5|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5036e.pdf&lt;!-- |accessdate=June 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Green Wall of China]]'' is a high-profile example of one method that has been finding success in this battle with desertification.{{According to whom|date=April 2018}}. This wall is a much larger-scale version of what American farmers did in the 1930s to stop the great Midwest dust bowl. This plan was proposed in the late 1970s, and has become a major ecological engineering project that is not predicted to end until the year 2055. According to Chinese reports, there have been nearly 66,000,000,000 trees planted in China's great green wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/ | title=China's 'Great Green Wall' Fights Expanding Desert| date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the success that China has been finding in stopping the spread of desertification, plans are currently be made in Africa to start a "wall" along the borders of the Sahara desert as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Techniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil.

Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

Some soils (for example, clay), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of sandy soils). Some techniques as zaï or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth – National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&amp;nbsp;m long, 1&amp;nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home – Justdiggit|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research centra (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrients from the soil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=Département Biologie Végétale – Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt-flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in  [[Saudi-Arabia]]. These salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-André Berdellé July 2011] H2O magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest — A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change – Water Matters – State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|left|thumb|It is argued that managed grazing methods are able to restore grasslands.&lt;ref name=ASavory/&gt;]]

===Managed grazing===
Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air into plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant.&lt;ref name=Tlovell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimic natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130625040133/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|archivedate=June 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt; [[Allan Savory]], as part of [[holistic management]], claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification, prehistoric lands used to support large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the United States are still desertifying;&lt;ref name=ASavory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/06/how-cows-could-repair-the-world-allan-savory-at-ted/|title=How cows could repair the world|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[range science|range scientists]] have however not been able to experimentally confirm his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Briske|first=D.

The term was first introduced in a paper in Nature Biotechnology by [[Sachin H. Jain]] and [[John Brownstein]].&lt;ref name="JainPowers2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=Sachin H|last2=Powers|first2=Brian W|last3=Hawkins|first3=Jared B|last4=Brownstein|first4=John S|title=The digital phenotype|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=5|year=2015|pages=462–463|issn=1087-0156|doi=10.1038/nbt.3223|pmid=25965751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones are well suited to digital phenotyping given their widespread adoption and ownership, the extent to which users engage with the devices, and richness of data that may be collected from them. Smartphone data can be used to study behavioral patterns, social interactions, physical mobility, gross motor activity, and speech production, among others. Smartphone ownership has been in steady rise globally over the past few years. For example, in the U.S., smartphone [[ownership]] among adults increased from 35% in 2011 to 64% in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/|title=U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015|last=Smith|first=Aaron|date=2015-04-01|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 an estimated 95% of Americans own a cellphone of some kind and 77% own a smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/|title=Mobile Fact Sheet|date=2017-01-12|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of passive data collection from smartphone devices can provide granular information relevant to psychiatric and other illness phenotypes. Types of relevant passive data include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data to monitor spatial location, [[accelerometer]] data to record movement and gross motor activity, and call and messaging logs to document [[social engagement]] with others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torous|first=John|last2=Staples|first2=Patrick|last3=Onnela|first3=Jukka-Pekka|date=2015-08-01|title=Realizing the Potential of Mobile Mental Health: New Methods for New Data in Psychiatry|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=61|doi=10.1007/s11920-015-0602-0|issn=1523-3812|pmc=4608747|pmid=26073363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''ECSE''' is an abbreviation for ''[[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer science|Computer Sciences]] and [[Systems theory|Systems Engineering]].'' It is a designation used at some [[University|universities]] for the major or department that blends these three fields together.

One reason behind linking the areas of study is to provide students with a broad overview of each of [[software]], [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Systems theory]]. However there are also reasons for not blending departments: Students who major in theoretical computer science, studying such topics as algorithm analysis and software engineering, may not have any use for extensive electrical engineering or systems theory classes.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

Not every university uses the ECSE designation. Several universities, for example, have separate EE/ECE and CS departments/majors. Other schools use the similar [[Electrical and Computer Engineering|ECE]] (Electrical and Computer Engineering) designation. Additionally, some schools which offer an ECSE degree also offer degrees in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science separately.

[[Image:Plastids_types.svg|thumb|Different types of [[plastid]]]]
'''Etioplasts''' are [[chloroplast]]s that have not been exposed to light. They are usually found in [[flowering plants]] (Angiosperms) grown in the dark. If a plant is kept out of light for several days, its normal chloroplasts will actually convert into etioplasts. Etioplasts lack active pigment and can technically be considered [[leucoplast]]s. High concentrations of etioplasts will cause leaves to appear yellow rather than green.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Robert|title=The Diversity of Plastid Form and Function|publisher=Springer|date=2007|chapter=1|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/qp032630631337u6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These plant [[organelle]]s contain prolamellar bodies, which are membrane aggregations of semi-crystalline lattices of branched tubules that carry the precursor pigment for [[chlorophyll]]. The prolamellar bodies are often (and presumed always) arranged in geometric patterns.&lt;ref name="wise" /&gt;

They are converted to chloroplasts via the stimulation of chlorophyll synthesis by the plant hormone [[cytokinin]] soon after exposure to light. [[Thylakoid]]s and [[Thylakoid|grana]] arise from the prolamellar bodies during this process.

In the field of [[waste management]], '''extended producer responsibility''' ('''EPR''') is a strategy designed to promote the integration of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{OECD (2001). ''Extended Producer Responsibility: A Guidance Manual for Governments''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives as it
"focuses on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael R.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Ian P.|date=2014-10-01|title=Product recovery decisions within the context of Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923474813000817|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|series=Engineering and Technology Management for Sustainable Business Development|volume=34|pages=9–28|doi=10.1016/j.jengtecman.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by [[Thomas Lindhqvist]] in a 1990 report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist &amp; Karl Lidgren, "Models for Extended Producer Responsibility," in Sweden, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry, the following definition emerged: "[EPR] is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product, by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life-cycle of the product and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist, "Towards an [EPR]- analysis of experiences and proposals," April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

EPR uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach, which differs from [[product stewardship]], which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Waste to Wealth|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain [[priority product]]s by requiring manufacturers internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based upon the principle that because producers (usually brand owners) have the greatest control over product design and marketing and these same companies have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|title=Producer Responsibility Recycling|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|accessdate=May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111452/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR may take the form of a reuse, buy-back, or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party, a so-called ''producer responsibility organization'' (PRO), which is paid by the producer for used-product management. In this way, EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry, obliging producers, importers and/or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensuring the safe handling of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hanisch, C. (2000). Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?. Environ Sci Technol, 34 (7), pp.170 A-175 A.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example for producer responsibility organizations are the member organizations of PRO EUROPE. PRO EUROPE s.p.r.l. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, is the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO EUROPE are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner.  In many countries, this is done through the [[Green Dot (symbol)|Green Dot]]  trademark of which PRO EUROPE is the general licensor. The Green Dot has evolved into a proven concept in many countries as implementation of Producer Responsibility. In twenty-five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of sales packaging.

==Take-back==

In response to all of the growing problem of excessive waste, several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products' useful life, or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials, or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take-back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all wastes are managed in a way that protects public health and the environment.
The goals of take-back laws are to
#encourage companies to design products for reuse, recyclability, and materials reduction;
#correcting market signals to the consumer by incorporating waste management costs into the product’s price;
#promoting innovation in recycling technology.&lt;ref&gt;James Sallzman, Sustainable Consumption and the Law, 27ENVTL. L. 1274 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
Take-back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to redesign their products to minimize waste management costs, by designing their products to contain safer materials (so they do not need to be managed separately) or designing products that are easier to recycle and reuse (so recycling becomes more profitable).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Roeder, Hazardous Waste: Advocacy Group Recommendations Promote Manufacturer Responsibility, DAILY ENV”T REP., March 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest take-back activity began in Europe, where government-sponsored take-back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on [[WEEE|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)]]. The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/96/EC of 27 January 2003 on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), 203 O.J. (l 37) 46&lt;/ref&gt; These take-back programs have been now adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States, most of these policies have been implemented at the state level, due to the political impasse at the federal level.

== Plastic bags ==

Recycling, banning, and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/24472/epr.pdf|title=Extended Producer Responsibility An examination of its impact on innovation and greening products|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, under the Clinton presidency, the President's Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/EPR.html|title=Proceedings - Extended Product Responsibility|website=clinton2.nara.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can, however, make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market, which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toffel|first=Michael W.|last2=Stein|first2=Antoinette|last3=Lee|first3=Katharine L.|date=2008-01-01|title=Extending Producer Responsibility: An Evaluation Framework for Product Take-Back Policies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hbs/wpaper/09-026.html|publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is banning or taxation of plastic bags, which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States, EPR has not successfully been made mandatory, instead being voluntary.  What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation, producer responsibility, and recycling to combat pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160624090252/https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 24, 2016|title=Public Policy Approaches for the Reduction of Plastic Bag Marine Debris|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics==

Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of [[electronic waste|e-waste]] — used electronics contain materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In 2007, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, people threw away 2.5 million tons of cell phones, TVs, computers, and printers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reagan|first=Robert|date=March 15, 2015|title=A COMPARISON OF E-WASTE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CHINA|url=|journal=Vermont Journal of Environmental Law|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturer Takeback Programs|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronics/manufacturer-takeback-programs/|publisher=Electronics Takeback Coalition|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that local and manufacturer-supported extended producer responsibility laws give manufacturers greater responsibility for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of their own products.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;

The kinds of chemicals found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in the bulbs in flat screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system.  Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer.  Poorer countries are dumping grounds for the United States' e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, 25 states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/wp-content/uploads/Lessons-Learned-from-State-E-waste-laws.pdf|title=Ten Lessons Learned from State E-Waste Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronics TakeBack Coalition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e-waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.productstewardship.us/page/State_EPR_Laws_Map|title=Map of State EPR Laws|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Product Stewardship Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Essentially, these EPR programs have included some driver for increased collection of e-waste, and that is why these states have seen a greater impact on proper e-waste disposal than others. 

Advocates for EPR also argue that including "high expectations for performance" into the laws, and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements, contribute to making the laws successful. In this way, manufacturers can be incentivized to collect more and dispose of e-waste more properly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the larger the scope of products that can be collected, the more e-waste will be disposed of properly.

Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|European Union]] has taken steps to combat the issue of electronic waste management. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/e-waste1.htm|title=How E-waste Works|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|date=|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese laws regarding e-waste are similar to the ones in the EU, but they focus on banning the import of e-waste. This has proven to be difficult, however, because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-million-tons-illegal-e-waste-smuggled-china-each-year-180949930/|title=Eight Million Tons of Illegal E-Waste is Smuggled into China Each Year|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|date=February 28, 2014|website=Smithsonian|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to dispose of e-waste in [[Electronic waste in China|China]] today, a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution.

===Advantages===

When producers either face a financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, they may be incentivized to design more sustainable, less [[electronic waste|toxic]], and easily recyclable electronics.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806123116/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070812124841/http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers' end-of-life costs.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epr"&gt;http://www.eprworkinggroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended producer responsibility is often cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash|first=Bhavani|title=The Light Bulb Conspiracy: The Story of Planned Obsolescence|url=http://www.ecowalkthetalk.com/blog/2011/08/26/the-light-bulb-conspiracy-the-story-of-planned-obsolescence/|publisher=Eco Walk the Talk|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annie Leonard interview &amp; "Story of Electronics" release|url=http://www.nourishthespirit.com/annie-leonard-interview-story-of-electronics-release/|publisher=Nourish the Spirit|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one way to fight [[planned obsolescence]], because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer.

===Disadvantages===
Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle, such as [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium-ion polymer batteries]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility, it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value, such as with CRT televisions, which can contain up to five pounds of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do CRT monitors contain lead?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question678.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; 

Other critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera|first=Ray|title=Mayor Calls Electronics Recycling Bill 'Illegal'|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/mayor-says-hell-ignore-veto-on-electronic-recycling/#comment-39647|work=City Room|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market, by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally-friendly designs because "manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material-use per unit of output, reduced energy use in making and delivering each product, and improved environmental performance."&lt;ref&gt;Gattuso, Dana, and Joel Schwartz. "Extended Producer Responsibility." Reason Foundation. Reason Foundation, 1 June 2002. Web. 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reason Foundation]] argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling, but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials, so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/studies/show/extended-producer-responsibili|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|last=Schwartz|first=Joel|date=June 1, 2002|website=Reason Foundation|publisher=The Reason Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

EPR has been implemented in many forms, which may be classified into three major approaches:
* Mandatory
* Negotiated
* Voluntary

It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers' preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries ("on-site" or "direct" allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale, most existing schemes for [[corporate sustainability]] reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company, and not supply-chain impacts&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council on Sustainable Development an World Resources Institute (2001). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Conches-Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this world view, "upstream and downstream [environmental] impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors' spheres of influence are not reflected".&lt;ref&gt;Spangenberg, J. H. and S. Lorek (2002). Environmentally sustainable household consumption: from aggregate environmental pressures to priority fields of action. Ecological Economics, 43, pp. 127-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence, especially in the industrialised world, are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer-focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption-related aspects, demand-side measures to environmental problems are rarely exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, T. (1999). Consumption and environment: some conceptual issues. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;Munksgaard, J. and K. A. Pedersen (2001). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accounts for open economies: producer or consumer responsibility. Energy Policy, 29, pp. 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Environmental Protection Agency (1998). Denmark's Second National Communication on Climate Change submitted under the UN FCCC. [http://www.mst.dk Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, at the company level, "when adopting the concept of eco-efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO 14001, it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company".&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. and L. Karlson (2002). Business incentives for sustainability: a property rights approach. Ecological Economics, 40, pp. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 "Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life-cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start."&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. (2005) Environmental Strategies in Industry: Turning Business Incentives into Sustainability. Report 5455. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; A life-cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks: "Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility (physical and/or financial) not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product, but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products."&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2001, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; "The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they were facing severe landfill shortages. [... As a result,] EPR is generally applied to post-consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management."&lt;ref&gt;Environment Protection Authority New South Wales 2003, p. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover, applying conventional [[life cycle assessment]], and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to [[Double counting (accounting)|double-counting]]. Using [[input-output analysis]], researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers' supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gallego, B. and M. Lenzen (2005). A consistent input-output formulation of shared producer and consumer responsibility. Economic Systems Research, 17(4), pp. 365-391.&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain – producers and consumers.

==Examples==

Auto Recycling Nederland (ARN) is a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) that organises vehicle recycling in the [[Netherlands]]. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union's [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]].

The Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology (SWICO), an ICT industry organisation, became a PRO to address the problem of [[electronic waste]].

The Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (CAP-EPR) was adopted in Canada in 2009 under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP-EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts, Canada fell short of many other [[Group of Eight|G8]] and [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/current_priorities/waste/pn_1499_epr_cap_e.pdf|title=Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=October 2009|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the CAP-EPR’s 2009 inception, most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. “Nine out of ten provinces have [since implemented] EPR programs or [put] requirements in place… As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones, almost half of the product categories for Phase 1 are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/extended/CAP-EPR%20Progress%20Report.pdf|title=Progress Report on the Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extender Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

In Germany, since the adoption of EPR, "between 1991 and 1998, the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from 94.7 kg to 82 kg, resulting in a reduction of 13.4%".&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"&gt;Hanisch, Carola. "Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?" Environmental Science &amp; Technology 34.7 (2000): 170A-75A. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to Germany's influence in EPR, the "European Commission developed one waste directive" for all of member states (Hanisch 2000). One major goal was to have all member states recycle "25% of all packaging material"&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"/&gt; and have accomplished the goal.

In the United States, EPR is gaining popularity "with 40 such laws enacted since 2008. In 2010 alone, 38 such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States, and 12 were signed into law."&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. "Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States." ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' 17.2 (2013): 175-85. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these laws are only at the state level as there are no federal laws for EPR. So far, "only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as 32 states having at least one EPR law".&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6740">The '''fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation''' ('''FPOM''' or '''pay-off method''') &lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jamds/2009/238196.html Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation], ''[[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences]]'', vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a new method for [[valuation (finance)|valuing]] [[real options]], created in 2008. It is based on the use of [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy number]]s for the creation of the possible pay-off [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of a project (real option). The structure of the method is similar to the probability theory based [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation]],&lt;ref&gt;Datar, V. &amp; Mathews, S. 2004. European Real Options: An Intuitive Algorithm for the Black Scholes Formula. Journal of Applied Finance, 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, S. &amp; Datar, V. 2007. A Practical Method for Valuing Real Options: The Boeing Approach. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 19(2): 95–104.&lt;/ref&gt; but the method is not based on probability theory and uses fuzzy numbers and possibility theory in framing the real option valuation problem.

==Method==

The Fuzzy pay-off method derives the real option value from a pay-off distribution that is created by using three or four cash-flow scenarios (most often created by an expert or a group of experts). The pay-off distribution is created simply by assigning each of the three cash-flow scenarios a corresponding definition with regards to a fuzzy number (triangular fuzzy number for three scenarios and a trapezoidal fuzzy number for four scenarios). This means that the pay-off distribution is created without any simulation whatsoever. This makes the procedure easy and transparent. The scenarios used are a minimum possible scenario (the lowest possible outcome), the maximum possible scenario (the highest possible outcome) and a best estimate (most likely to happen scenario) that is mapped as a fully possible scenario with a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes, or in the case of four scenarios used - two best estimate scenarios that are the upper and lower limit of the interval that is assigned a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes.

The main observations that lie behind the model for deriving the real option value are the following:
# The fuzzy NPV of a project is (equal to) the pay-off distribution of a project value that is calculated with [[fuzzy number]]s.
# The mean value of the positive values of the fuzzy [[net present value|NPV]] is the "possibilistic" mean value of the positive fuzzy NPV values.
# Real option value, ROV, calculated from the fuzzy NPV is the "possibilistic" [[mean value]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. &amp; Majlender, P. 2003. On weighted possibilistic mean and variance of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 136: 363–374.&lt;/ref&gt; of the positive fuzzy NPV values multiplied with the positive area of the fuzzy NPV over the total area of the fuzzy NPV.

The real option formula can then be written simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ROV} = \frac{A(\mathrm{Pos})}{A(\mathrm{Pos})+A(\mathrm{Neg})} \times E[A_+]&lt;/math&gt;

::where ''A''(Pos) is the area of the positive part of the fuzzy distribution, ''A''(Neg) is the area of the negative part of the fuzzy distribution, and ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;] is the mean value of the positive part of the distribution. It can be seen that when the distribution is totally positive, the real options value reduces to the expected (mean) value, ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;].

As can be seen, the real option value can be derived directly from the fuzzy NPV, without simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation, Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences, vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, simulation is not an absolutely necessary step in the Datar–Mathews method, so the two methods are not very different in that respect. But what is totally different is that the Datar–Mathews method is based on probability theory and as such has a very different foundation from the pay-off method that is based on ''possibility'' theory: the way that the two models treat uncertainty is fundamentally different.

==Use of the method==
The pay-off method for real option valuation is very easy to use compared to the other real option valuation methods and it can be used with the most commonly used [[spreadsheet|spreadsheet software]] without any [[add-in]]s. The method is useful in analyses for decision making regarding investments that have an uncertain future, and especially so if the underlying data is in the form of cash-flow scenarios. The method is less useful if optimal timing is the objective. The method is flexible and accommodates easily both one-stage investments and multi-stage investments ([[compound option|compound]] real options).

The method has been taken into use in some large international industrial companies for the valuation of [[research and development]] projects and portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;Heikkilä, M., 2009, Selection of R&amp;D Portfolios of Real Options with Fuzzy Pay-offs under Bounded Rationality, IAMSR Research Report, 1/2009, {{ISBN|978-952-12-2316-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these analyses [[triangular distribution|triangular]] fuzzy numbers are used. Other uses of the method so far are, for example, R&amp;D project valuation  IPR valuation, valuation of [[M&amp;A]] targets and expected synergies,&lt;ref&gt;Kinnunen, J., 2010, Valuing [[M&amp;A|M&amp;A Synergies]] as (Fuzzy) Real Options, 14th Annual International Conference on Real Options in Rome, Italy, June 16–19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; valuation and optimization of M&amp;A strategies, valuation of area development (construction) projects, valuation of large industrial real investments. 

The use of the pay-off method is lately taught within the larger framework of real options, for example at the [[Lappeenranta University of Technology]] and at the [[Tampere University of Technology]] in Finland.

The rising of the [[Pleiades]] heralded the start of the [[Ancient Greek]] sailing season, using [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pleiad, n |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and significance==
[[Image:Kepler_Observatory_Linz_under_the_Stars.jpg|thumb|Sirius is the present star with the greatest [[apparent magnitude]] (after the sun) and one which is almost non-variable. The [[Pleiades]], a key feature of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] shown across [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in the same photograph also experience an annual period of visibility ("rising and setting").]]
Relative to the other stars, the sun appears to drift eastward (about {{frac|1|365.24219}} of Earth's orbit—hence almost one degree—per solar day) along a path called the [[ecliptic]] (specifically appearing in front of 13 constellations considered the [[zodiac]] constellations from a total of [[88 modern constellations]]) which is, by definition, the plane of the earth's orbit.  While the sun appears in front of (or south or north of) a relatively small group of stars they can no longer be seen either before dawn, during daytime or after sunset{{efn|except as to those directly north and south of it can be observed in a full [[solar eclipse]] or other rare conditions e.g. near the poles in the very early or late day}} &amp;mdash; their appearance coincides with that of the sun above the [[horizon]].  Depending on the observer's latitude many stars are subject to annual heliacal risings and settings.  Rising means the local latitude of the earth has moved along its orbit such that the star, star cluster or galaxy emerges for part of the year to within months be visible for the whole night and then for the early portion of the night. Thus the star's first emergence, an annual rise, is immediately before dawn. The risen status of each star is easiest considered day-on-day in the [[tropics]] where the time of dawn varies less. The rising of a star which has had its annual rising ("heliacal rising"), typically over months, rises earlier at night and so at dawn figures more toward its annual highest point (meridian) and then in later dawns more toward the west all by about {{frac|1|182}}th of its arc (about {{frac|1|365}} of the circle) per day, until, observing the western sky after sunset, it has already disappeared. This is called the ''cosmical setting''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/time/risesetstar.htm rising and setting of stars]&lt;/ref&gt; The same star will reappear in the eastern sky at dawn approximately one year after its previous rising. For zodiac and near-zodiac constellations (near the [[ecliptic]], the apparent daily path of the sun), Earth's [[precession of the equinoxes|precession]] means the date of their rising decreases gradually, completing one cycle in about 26,000 years (for example at the March Equinox, the position of the Sun relative the stars &amp;mdash; at which Right Ascension is calibrated as zero, the [[First Point of Aries]], is in the preceding constellation of Pisces.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/2005/09/10/archaic-astronomy-and-heliacal-rising/ Archaic Astronomy and Heliacal Rising]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-application to circumpolar stars at extra-tropical latitudes==
Some stars, when viewed from [[latitude]]s outside of the tropics on Earth, do not rise or set. These are [[circumpolar star]]s, which are either always in the sky or never.  For example, the [[North Star]] (Polaris) is not visible in Australia and the [[Southern Cross]] is not seen in Europe, because they always stay below the respective horizons.  

The term ''circumpolar'' is somewhat localised as between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Southern polar constellations have a brief spell of annual visibility (thus "heliacal" rising and "cosmic" setting) and the same applies as to the other polar constellations in respect of the reverse tropic.

== History ==
Constellations containing stars that rise and set were incorporated into early [[calendar]]s or [[zodiac]]s. The [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] all used the heliacal risings of various stars for the timing of agricultural activities.

Because of its position about 40° off the ecliptic, the heliacal risings of the bright star [[Sirius]] occur over a "Sothic year" almost exactly synchronized with the [[solar year]].{{efn|The [[Sothic year]] is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Since the development of [[civilization]], this has occurred at [[Cairo]] on July 19 on the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The exact date varies with [[latitude]], so that Sirius's return is observed about 8–10 days later on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast than at [[Elephantine|Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; The date at any location also slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Its returns also roughly corresponded to the onset of the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]] before it was ended by the [[Aswan Low Dam|Aswan Low]] and [[Aswan High Dam|High Dams]]. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians appear to have constructed their 365-day [[Egyptian calendar|civil calendar]] at a time when Wep Renpet, its [[New Year]], corresponded with Sirius's return to the night sky.&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; Although this calendar's lack of [[leap year]]s caused the event to shift one day every four years or so, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomical records]] of this displacement led to the discovery of the [[Sothic cycle]] and, later, the establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

The Egyptians also devised a method of telling the time at night based on the heliacal risings of 36 [[Decans|decan stars]], one for each 10° segment of the 360° circle of the zodiac and corresponding to the ten-day "weeks" of their civil calendar.

To the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], the [[Pleiades]] are called [[Matariki]], and their heliacal rising signifies the beginning of the new year (around June). The [[Mapuche]] of [[South America]] called the Pleiades ''Ngauponi'' which in the vicinity of the ''[[we tripantu]]'' (Mapuche new year) will disappear by the west, ''lafkenmapu'' or ''ngulumapu'', appearing at dawn to the East, a few days before the birth of new life in nature. Heliacal rising of Ngauponi, i.e. appearance of the Pleiades by the horizon over an hour before the Sun approximately 12 days before the winter solstice, announced ''we tripantu''.

When a planet has a heliacal rising, there is a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with the sun beforehand. Depending on the type of conjunction, there may be a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]], [[eclipse]], [[Transit (astronomy)|transit]], or [[occultation]] of the sun.

==Rising at sunset==
The rising of a planet above the eastern horizon at [[sunset]] is called its ''acronychal rising'', which for a [[superior planet]] signifies an [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], another type of [[syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]. 

When the Moon has an acronychal rising, it will occur near [[full moon]] and thus, in a small number of cases, a noticeable [[lunar eclipse]].

Herbicides have been universally used in agriculture because of their enormous benefits to society but you wouldn't know that by reading this article.|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Sprayed weeds.jpg|thumb|250px|Weeds controlled with herbicide]]

'''Herbicides''', also commonly known as '''weedkillers''', are chemical substances used to control unwanted [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=EPAusage2011/&gt; '''Selective herbicides''' control specific weed species, while leaving the desired [[crop]] relatively unharmed, while '''non-selective herbicides''' (sometimes called '''total weedkillers''' in commercial products) can be used to clear waste ground, industrial and construction sites, railways and railway embankments as they kill all [[plant]] material with which they come into contact. Apart from selective/non-selective, other important distinctions include ''persistence'' (also known as ''residual action'': how long the product stays in place and remains active), ''means of uptake'' (whether it is absorbed by above-ground [[foliage]] only, through the [[root]]s, or by other means), and ''mechanism of action'' (how it works). Historically, products such as [[common salt]] and other [[Salt (chemistry)|metal salts]] were used as herbicides, however these have gradually fallen out of favor and in some countries a number of these are banned due to their persistence in soil, and [[toxicity]] and [[groundwater]] contamination concerns. Herbicides have also been [[herbicidal warfare|used in warfare and conflict]].

Modern herbicides are often synthetic mimics of natural [[plant hormone]]s which interfere with growth of the target plants. The term '''organic herbicide''' has come to mean herbicides intended for [[organic farming]]. Some plants also produce their own natural herbicides, such as the genus ''[[Juglans]]'' ([[walnut]]s), or the [[tree of heaven]]; such action of natural herbicides, and other related chemical interactions, is called [[allelopathy]]. Due to [[herbicide resistance]] - a major concern in [[agriculture]] - a number of products combine herbicides with different means of action. [[Integrated pest management]] may use herbicides alongside other pest control methods.

In the US in 2007, about 83% of all herbicide usage, determined by weight applied, was in agriculture.&lt;ref name=EPAusage2011/&gt;{{rp|12}}  In 2007, world pesticide expenditures totaled about $39.4 billion; herbicides were about 40% of those sales and constituted the biggest portion, followed by insecticides, fungicides, and other types.&lt;ref name=EPAusage2011&gt;EPA.

==History==
Prior to the widespread use of chemical herbicides, [[cultural controls]], such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/228071686|title=Encyclopedia of environment and society|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Robbins, Paul, 1967-, Sage Publications.|isbn=9781452265582|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=862|oclc=228071686|last1=Robbins|first1=Paul|date=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds.

===First herbicides===
[[File:2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid structure.svg|thumb|[[2,4-D]], the first chemical herbicide, was discovered during the [[Second World War]].]]
Although research into chemical herbicides began in the early 20th century, the first major breakthrough was the result of research conducted in both the UK and the US during the [[Second World War]] into the potential [[herbicidal warfare|use of herbicides in war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVK4vrpma2YC|title=Herbicides and Plant Physiology|author1=Andrew H. Cobb |author2=John P. H. Reade |year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|chapter=7.1|isbn=9781444322491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern herbicide, [[2,4-D]], was first discovered and synthesized by [[W. G. Templeman]] at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. In 1940, he showed that "Growth substances applied appropriately would kill certain broad-leaved weeds in cereals without harming the crops." By 1941, his team succeeded in synthesizing the chemical. In the same year, Pokorny in the US achieved this as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpx25mRzF_YC|title=A History of Weed Science in the United States|author=Robert L Zimdahl|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780123815026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently, a team under [[Juda Hirsch Quastel]], working at the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] made the same discovery. Quastel was tasked by the [[Agricultural and Food Research Council|Agricultural Research Council]] (ARC) to discover methods for improving crop yield. By analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was able to apply techniques such as [[perfusion]]. Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones, inhibitors and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work of the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war, including the 2,4-D compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1021/ba-1950-0001.ch045|chapter=2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D) as a Selective Herbicide|title=Agricultural Control Chemicals|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1950|last1=Quastel|first1=J. H.|isbn=978-0-8412-2442-1|volume=1|pages=244–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 2,4-D was commercially released in 1946, it triggered a worldwide revolution in agricultural output and became the first successful selective herbicide. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in [[wheat]], [[maize]] (corn), [[rice]], and similar [[cereal]] grass crops, because it kills [[dicots]] (broadleaf plants), but not most [[monocots]] (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often [[trimethylamine]]) or one of many [[ester]]s of the parent compound. These are easier to handle than the acid.

===Further discoveries===
The triazine family of herbicides, which includes [[atrazine]], were introduced in the 1950s; they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above neutral [[pH]]. Under alkaline soil conditions, atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. Atrazine is thus said to have "carryover", a generally undesirable property for herbicides.

[[Glyphosate]] (Roundup) was introduced in 1974 for nonselective weed control. Following the development of glyphosate-resistant crop plants, it is now used very extensively for selective weed control in growing crops. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.

Many modern chemical herbicides used in agriculture and [[gardening]] are specifically formulated to decompose within a short period after application. This is desirable, as it allows crops and plants to be planted afterwards, which could otherwise be affected by the herbicide. However, herbicides with low residual activity (i.e., that decompose quickly) often do not provide season-long weed control and do not ensure that weed roots are killed beneath construction and paving (and cannot emerge destructively in years to come), therefore there remains a role for weedkiller with high levels of persistence in the soil.

==Terminology==
Herbicides are classified/grouped in various ways e.g. according to the activity, timing of application, method of application, mechanism of action, chemical family. This gives rise to a considerable level of terminology related to herbicides and their use.

===Intended outcome===
* Control is the destruction of unwanted weeds, or the damage of them to the point where they are no longer competitive with the crop.
* Suppression is incomplete control still providing some economic benefit, such as reduced competition with the crop.
* Crop safety, for selective herbicides, is the relative absence of damage or stress to the crop. Most selective herbicides cause some visible stress to crop plants.
* [[Defoliant]], similar to herbicides, but designed to remove [[foliage]] (leaves) rather than kill the plant.

===Selectivity (all plants or specific plants)===
* Selective herbicides control or suppress certain plants without affecting the growth of other plants species. Selectivity may be due to translocation, differential absorption, physical (morphological) or physiological differences between plant species. 2,4-D, mecoprop, dicamba control many broadleaf weeds but remain ineffective against turfgrasses.&lt;ref name=Vats&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vats|first1=S.|editor1-last=Lichtfouse|editor1-first=E.|title=Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 15|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=153–192|chapter=Herbicides: history, classification and genetic manipulation of plants for herbicide resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-selective herbicides are not specific in acting against certain plant species and control all plant material with which they come into contact. They are used to clear industrial sites, waste ground, railways and railway embankments. Paraquat, glufosinate, glyphosate are non-selective herbicides.&lt;ref name=Vats /&gt;

===Timing of application===
* Preplant: Preplant herbicides are nonselective herbicides applied to soil before planting.  Some preplant herbicides may be mechanically incorporated into the soil. The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility. The herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone. Volatile herbicides have to be incorporated into the soil before planting the pasture. Agricultural crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes, corn, soybeans and strawberries. Soil fumigants like metam-sodium and dazomet are in use as preplant herbicides.&lt;ref name=Vats/&gt;
* Preemergence: Preemergence herbicides are applied before the weed seedlings emerge through the soil surface. Herbicides do not prevent weeds from germinating but they kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide treated zone by affecting the cell division in the emerging seedling. Dithopyr and pendimethalin are preemergence herbicides. Weeds that have already emerged before application or activation are not affected by pre-herbicides as their primary growing point escapes the treatment.&lt;ref name=Vats/&gt;
* Postemergence: These herbicides are applied after weed seedlings have emerged through the soil surface. They can be foliar or root absorbed, selective or nonselective, contact or systemic. Application of these herbicides is avoided during rain because the problem of being washed off to the soil makes it ineffective. 2,4-D is a selective, systemic, foliar absorbed postemergence herbicide.&lt;ref name=Vats /&gt;

===Method of application===
* Soil applied: Herbicides applied to the soil are usually taken up by the root or shoot of the emerging seedlings and are used as preplant or preemergence treatment. Several factors influence the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides. Weeds absorb herbicides by both passive and active mechanism. Herbicide adsorption to soil colloids or organic matter often reduces its amount available for weed absorption. Positioning of herbicide in correct layer of soil is very important, which can be achieved mechanically and by rainfall. Herbicides on the soil surface are subjected to several processes that reduce their availability. Volatility and photolysis are two common processes that reduce the availability of herbicides. Many soil applied herbicides are absorbed through plant shoots while they are still underground leading to their death or injury. EPTC and trifluralin are soil applied herbicides.&lt;ref name=Vats/&gt;
* Foliar applied: These are applied to portion of the plant above the ground and are absorbed by exposed tissues. These are generally postemergence herbicides and can either be translocated (systemic) throughout the plant or remain at specific site (contact). External barriers of plants like cuticle, waxes, cell wall etc. affect herbicide absorption and action. Glyphosate, 2,4-D and dicamba are foliar applied herbicide.&lt;ref name=Vats /&gt;

===Persistence===
* Residual activity: An herbicide is described as having low residual activity if it is neutralized within a short time of application (within a few weeks or months) - typically this is due to rainfall, or by reactions in the soil. An herbicide described as having high residual activity will remain potent for a long term in the soil.  For some compounds, the residual activity can leave the ground almost permanently barren.

==Mechanism of action==
Herbicides are often classified according to their site of action, because as a general rule, herbicides within the same site of action class will produce similar symptoms on susceptible plants. Classification based on site of action of herbicide is comparatively better as herbicide resistance management can be handled more properly and effectively.&lt;ref name=Vats /&gt; Classification by [[mechanism of action]] (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application.

===List of mechanisms found in modern herbicides===
* ACCase inhibitors: [[Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase]] (ACCase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis. Thus, ACCase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the [[meristems]] of the grass plant. The ACCases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides, whereas the ACCases of [[dicot]] plants are not.
* ALS inhibitors: the [[acetolactate synthase]] (ALS) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) is the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids ([[valine]], [[leucine]], and [[isoleucine]]). These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these [[amino acid]]s, which eventually leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. They affect grasses and dicots alike. The ALS inhibitor family includes various [[sulfonylurea#Herbicides|sulfonylurea]]s (SUs) (such as [[Flazasulfuron]] and [[Metsulfuron-methyl]]), [[Imazaquin#Imidazolinone herbicides|imidazolinone]]s (IMIs), [[:Category:Triazolopyrimidines|triazolopyrimidine]]s (TPs), [[pyrimidinyl oxybenzoate]]s (POBs), and [[sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinone]]s (SCTs). The ALS biological pathway exists only in plants and not animals, thus making the ALS-inhibitors among the safest herbicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou Q, Liu W, Zhang Y, Liu KK | title = Action mechanisms of acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides | journal = Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | date = Oct 2007 | pages = 89–96 | doi = 10.1016/j.pestbp.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EPSPS inhibitors: [[EPSP synthase|Enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme]] (EPSPS) is used in the synthesis of the amino acids [[tryptophan]], [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. They affect grasses and dicots alike. [[Glyphosate]] (Roundup) is a systemic EPSPS inhibitor inactivated by soil contact.
* Synthetic auxins inaugurated the era of organic herbicides. They were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator [[auxin]]. Synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone. They have several points of action on the cell membrane, and are effective in the control of dicot plants. [[2,4-D]] is a synthetic auxin herbicide.
* Photosystem II inhibitors reduce electron flow from water to [[NADP|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] at the photochemical step in photosynthesis. They bind to the Qb site on the D1 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site. Therefore, this group of compounds causes electrons to accumulate on [[chlorophyll]] molecules. As a consequence, [[oxidation]] reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, and the plant dies. The [[triazine]] herbicides (including [[atrazine]]) and urea derivatives (diuron) are photosystem II inhibitors.&lt;ref name="stryer"&gt;{{cite book |last = Stryer |first = Lubert |title = Biochemistry, 4th Edition |publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company |year = 1995 |page = 670 |isbn = 978-0-7167-2009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Photosystem I inhibitors steal electrons from the normal pathway through FeS to Fdx to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; leading to direct discharge of electrons on oxygen. As a result, reactive oxygen species are produced and [[oxidation]] reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, leading to plant death.  [[Bipyridinium]] herbicides (such as [[diquat]] and [[paraquat]]) inhibit the FeS to Fdx step of that chain, while [[diphenyl ether]] herbicides (such as [[nitrofen]], [[nitrofluorfen]], and [[acifluorfen]]) inhibit the Fdx to NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; step.&lt;ref name="stryer"/&gt;
* [[P-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor|HPPD inhibitors]] inhibit [[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]], which are involved in [[tyrosine]] breakdown.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moran GR | date = Jan 2005 | title = 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase | url = http://alchemy.chem.uwm.edu/classes/chem603/Handouts/ABBHPPDreview.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arch Biochem Biophys | volume = 433 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–28 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2004.08.015 | pmid = 15581571 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140303175955/http://alchemy.chem.uwm.edu/classes/chem603/Handouts/ABBHPPDreview.pdf | archivedate = 2014-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrosine breakdown products are used by plants to make [[carotenoids]], which protect [[chlorophyll]] in plants from being destroyed by sunlight.

===Herbicide group (labeling)===
One of the most important methods for preventing, delaying, or managing resistance is to reduce the reliance on a single herbicide mode of action. To do this, farmers must know the mode of action for the  herbicides they intend to use, but the relatively complex nature of plant biochemistry makes this difficult to determine. Attempts were made to simplify the understanding of herbicide mode of action by developing a classification system that grouped herbicides by mode of action.&lt;ref name=Shaner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaner|first1=D.

Groups in the WSSA and the HRAC systems are designated by numbers and letters, respectively.&lt;ref name=Retzinger /&gt; The goal for adding the “Group” classification and mode of action to the herbicide product label is to provide a simple and practical approach to deliver the information to users. This information will make it easier to develop educational material that is consistent and effective.&lt;ref name=Shaner /&gt; It should increase user’s awareness of herbicide mode of action and provide more accurate recommendations for resistance management.&lt;ref name=Mallory-Smith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallory-Smith|first1=C.|title=Impact of labeling herbicides by site of action: A University view|journal=Weed Technology|date=1999|volume=13|page=662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another goal is to make it easier for users to keep records on which herbicide mode of actions are being used on a particular field from year to year.&lt;ref name=Shaner /&gt;

===Chemical family===
Detailed investigations on chemical structure of the active ingredients of the registered herbicides showed that some moieties (moiety is a part of a molecule that may include either whole functional groups or parts of functional groups as substructures; a functional group has similar chemical properties whenever it occurs in different compounds) have the same mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name="10.1111/wre.12153" /&gt; According to Forouzesh ''et al''. 2015,&lt;ref name="10.1111/wre.12153" /&gt; these moieties have been assigned to the names of chemical families and active ingredients are then classified within the chemical families accordingly. Knowing about herbicide chemical family grouping could serve as a short-term strategy for managing resistance to site of action.&lt;ref name="10.4141/P05-193"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckie|first1=H. J.|last2=Harker|first2=L. M.|last3=Hall|first3=S. I.|title=A decade of herbicide-resistant crops in Canada|journal=Canadian Journal of Plant Science|volume=86|issue=4|pages=1243–1264|date=2006|doi=10.4141/P05-193|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and application==
[[File:Herbicide spraying, Carlson Waterfowl Production Area in LaMoure County, ND.jpg|thumb|Herbicides being sprayed from the spray arms of a tractor in North Dakota.]]
Most herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment. Ground equipment varies in design, but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled [[sprayer]]s equipped with long booms, of {{Convert|60|to|120|ft|m|0}} with spray nozzles spaced every {{Convert|20-30|in|mm}} apart. Towed, handheld, and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used. On large areas, herbicides may also at times be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes, or through [[irrigation]] systems (known as [[chemigation]]).

A further method of herbicide application developed around 2010, involves ridding the soil of its active weed [[seed bank]] rather than just killing the weed. This can successfully treat [[annual plant]]s but not [[perennial]]s. Researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] found that the application of herbicides to fields late in the weeds' [[growing season]] greatly reduces their [[seed]] production, and therefore fewer weeds will return the following season.  Because most weeds are annuals, their seeds will only survive in soil for a year or two, so this method will be able to destroy such weeds after a few years of herbicide application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100505.htm|title= A New Way to Use Herbicides: To Sterilize, Not Kill Weeds|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service|date=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weed-wiping]] may also be used, where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller weed plants. This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable shorter plants in the grassland [[sward]] beneath. The method has the benefit of avoiding spray drift. In [[Wales]], a scheme offering free weed-wiper hire was launched in 2015 in an effort to reduce the levels of [[MCPA]] in water courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=16 April 2015|title=Campaign launched to halt Welsh river pesticide rise|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-32326949|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse and misapplication===
[[Herbicide volatilisation]] or spray drift may result in herbicide affecting neighboring fields or plants, particularly in windy conditions. Sometimes, the wrong field or plants may be sprayed due to error.

==Health and environmental effects==
{{See also|Environmental effects of pesticides|Health effects of pesticides}}
Herbicides have widely variable [[toxicity]] in addition to [[acute toxicity]] arising from ingestion of a significant quantity rapidly, and [[chronic toxicity]] arising from environmental and occupational exposure  over long periods. Much public suspicion of herbicides revolves around a confusion between valid statements of ''acute'' toxicity as opposed to equally valid statements of lack of ''chronic'' toxicity at the recommended levels of usage. For instance, while [[glyphosate]] formulations with talloamine ''adjuvants''  are acutely toxic, their use was found to be uncorrelated with any health issues like cancer in a massive US Department of Health study on 90,000 members of farmer families for over a period of 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djx233|pmid=29136183|title=Glyphosate Use and Cancer Incidence in the Agricultural Health Study|journal=JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute|volume=110|issue=5|pages=509–516|year=2018|last1=Andreotti|first1=Gabriella|last2=Koutros|first2=Stella|last3=Hofmann|first3=Jonathan N|last4=Sandler|first4=Dale P|last5=Lubin|first5=Jay H|last6=Lynch|first6=Charles F|last7=Lerro|first7=Catherine C|last8=De Roos|first8=Anneclaire J|last9=Parks|first9=Christine G|last10=Alavanja|first10=Michael C|last11=Silverman|first11=Debra T|last12=Beane Freeman|first12=Laura E}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the study shows lack of chronic toxicity, but cannot question the herbicide's acute toxicity.

Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death. The pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption, improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife, inhalation of aerial sprays, or food consumption prior to the labelled preharvest interval. Under some conditions, certain herbicides can be transported via leaching or surface runoff to contaminate groundwater or distant surface water sources. Generally, the conditions that promote herbicide transport include intense storm events (particularly shortly after application) and soils with limited capacity to [[adsorb]] or retain the herbicides. Herbicide properties that increase likelihood of transport include persistence (resistance to degradation) and high water solubility.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith|title=Handbook of Weed Management Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTDFaJfOBm8C&amp;pg=PA245|date=18 July 1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9547-4|pages=245–278|chapter=8: Fate of herbicides in the environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products.

All commercially sold, organic and nonorganic herbicides must be extensively tested prior to approval for sale and labeling by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, because of the large number of herbicides in use, concern regarding health effects is significant. In addition to health effects caused by herbicides themselves, commercial herbicide mixtures often contain other chemicals, including [[inactive ingredients]], which have negative impacts on human health.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Ecological effects===
Commercial herbicide use generally has negative impacts on [[bird]] [[populations]], although the impacts are highly variable and often require [[field study|field studies]] to predict accurately. Laboratory studies have at times overestimated negative impacts on birds due to toxicity, predicting serious problems that were not observed in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[1125:FSOPAB]2.0.CO;2 | year = 1997 | volume = 7 | pages = 1125–1132 | title = Field Studies on Pesticides and Birds: Unexpected and Unique Relations | last1 = Blus | first1 = Lawrence J. | last2 = Henny | first2 = Charles J. | journal = Ecological Applications | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most observed effects are due not to toxicity, but to habitat changes and the decreases in abundance of species on which birds rely for food or shelter. Herbicide use in [[silviculture]], used to favor certain types of growth following [[clearcutting]], can cause significant drops in bird populations. Even when herbicides which have low toxicity to birds are used, they decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation on which the birds rely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=MacKinnon, D.

===Scientific uncertainty of full extent of herbicide effects===
The health and environmental effects of many herbicides is unknown, and even the scientific community often disagrees on the risk. For example, a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the [[carcinogenicity]] of [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]] had divided opinions on the likelihood 2,4-D causes [[cancer]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ibrahim MA, Bond GG, Burke TA, Cole P, Dost FN, Enterline PE, Gough M, Greenberg RS, Halperin WE, McConnell E | title = Weight of the evidence on the human carcinogenicity of 2,4-D | journal = Environ Health Perspect | year = 1991 | volume = 96 | pages = 213–222 | pmid = 1820267 | pmc = 1568222 | doi=10.1289/ehp.9196213|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|1992}}, studies on [[phenoxy herbicide]]s were too few to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides, even though evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of [[soft tissue sarcoma]] and [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="jnci"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howard I.

== Resistance ==
Weed resistance to herbicides has become a major concern in crop production worldwide.&lt;ref name="10.1111/wre.12153"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Abed|last1=Forouzesh|first2=Eskandar|last2=Zand|first3=Saeid|last3=Soufizadeh|first4=Sadegh|last4=Samadi Foroushani|title=Classification of herbicides according to chemical family for weed resistance management strategies–an update|journal=Weed Research|date=2015|doi=10.1111/wre.12153|volume=55|issue=4|pages=334–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance to herbicides is often attributed to lack of rotational programmes of herbicides and to continuous applications of herbicides with the same sites of action.&lt;ref name="10.4141/P05-193"/&gt; Thus, a true understanding of the sites of action of herbicides is essential for strategic planning of herbicide-based weed control.&lt;ref name="10.1111/wre.12153"/&gt;

Plants have developed resistance to [[atrazine]] and to ALS-inhibitors, and more recently, to [[glyphosate]] herbicides. [[Conyza canadensis|Marestail]] is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Marking, Syl (January 1, 2002) [http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/mag/soybean_marestail_jumps_glyphosate/ "Marestail Jumps Glyphosate Fence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710030349/http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/mag/soybean_marestail_jumps_glyphosate/ |date=2009-07-10 }}, Corn and Soybean Digest.&lt;/ref&gt; Glyphosate-resistant weeds are present in the vast majority of soybean, cotton and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds that can resist multiple other herbicides are spreading. Few new herbicides are near commercialization, and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance. Because most herbicides could not kill all weeds, farmers rotated crops and herbicides to stop resistant weeds. During its initial years, glyphosate was not subject to resistance and allowed farmers to reduce the use of rotation.&lt;ref name=s1309&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6152.1329| title = What Happens when Weed Killers Stop Killing?| year = 2013| last1 = Service | first1 = R. F.| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6152| pages = 1329| pmid=24052282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[family (biology)|family]] of weeds that includes waterhemp ([[Amaranthus rudis]]) is the largest concern. A 2008-9 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 Missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69%. Weeds from some 500 sites throughout Iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples. The use of other killers to target "residual" weeds has become common, and may be sufficient to have stopped the spread of resistance From 2005 through 2010 researchers discovered 13 different weed species that had developed resistance to glyphosate. But since then only two more have been discovered. Weeds resistant to multiple herbicides with completely different biological action modes are on the rise. In Missouri, 43% of samples were resistant to two different herbicides; 6% resisted three; and 0.5% resisted four. In Iowa 89% of waterhemp samples resist two or more herbicides, 25% resist three, and 10% resist five.&lt;ref name=s1309/&gt;

For southern cotton, herbicide costs has climbed from between $50 and $75 per hectare a few years ago to about $370 per hectare in 2013. Resistance is contributing to a massive shift away from growing cotton; over the past few years, the area planted with cotton has declined by 70% in Arkansas and by 60% in Tennessee. For soybeans in Illinois, costs have risen from about $25 to $160 per hectare.&lt;ref name=s1309/&gt;

Dow, Bayer CropScience, Syngenta and Monsanto are all developing seed varieties resistant to herbicides other than glyphosate, which will make it easier for farmers to use alternative weed killers. Even though weeds have already evolved some resistance to those herbicides, Powles says the new seed-and-herbicide combos should work well if used with proper rotation.&lt;ref name=s1309/&gt;

===Biochemistry of resistance===
Resistance to herbicides can be based on one of the following biochemical mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Powles|editor1-first=S. B.|editor2-last=Shaner|editor2-first=D. L.|title=Herbicide Resistance and World Grains|date=2001|publisher=CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL|isbn=9781420039085|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powles|first1=S.B.|last2=Yu|first2=Q.|title=Evolution in action: plants resistant to herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|date=2010|volume=61|pages=317–347|pmid=20192743|doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.06.064|pmid=27318518|bibcode=2016ScTEn.569.1618A|title=Herbicide-related signaling in plants reveals novel insights for herbicide use strategies, environmental risk assessment and global change assessment challenges|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=569-570|pages=1618–1628|last1=Alberto|first1=Diana|last2=Serra|first2=Anne-Antonella|last3=Sulmon|first3=Cécile|last4=Gouesbet|first4=Gwenola|last5=Couée|first5=Ivan|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Target-site resistance: This is due to a reduced (or even lost) ability of the herbicide to bind to its target protein. The effect usually relates to an enzyme with a crucial function in a metabolic pathway, or to a component of an electron-transport system. Target-site resistance may also be caused by an overexpression of the target enzyme (via gene amplification or changes in a gene promoter).
* Non-target-site resistance: This is caused by mechanisms that reduce the amount of herbicidal active compound reaching the target site. One important mechanism is an enhanced metabolic detoxification of the herbicide in the weed, which leads to insufficient amounts of the active substance reaching the target site. A reduced uptake and translocation, or sequestration of the herbicide, may also result in an insufficient herbicide transport to the target site.
* Cross-resistance: In this case, a single resistance mechanism causes resistance to several herbicides. The term target-site cross-resistance is used when the herbicides bind to the same target site, whereas non-target-site cross-resistance is due to a single non-target-site mechanism (e.g., enhanced metabolic detoxification) that entails resistance across herbicides with different sites of action.
* Multiple resistance: In this situation, two or more resistance mechanisms are present within individual plants, or within a plant population.

===Resistance management===
Worldwide experience has been that farmers tend to do little to prevent herbicide resistance developing, and only take action when it is a problem on their own farm or neighbor’s. Careful observation is important so that any reduction in herbicide efficacy can be detected. This may indicate evolving resistance. It is vital that resistance is detected at an early stage as if it becomes an acute, whole-farm problem, options are more limited and greater expense is almost inevitable. Table 1 lists factors which enable the risk of resistance to be assessed. An essential pre-requisite for confirmation of resistance is a good diagnostic test. Ideally this should be rapid, accurate, cheap and accessible. Many diagnostic tests have been developed, including glasshouse pot assays, petri dish assays and chlorophyll fluorescence. A key component of such tests is that the response of the suspect population to a herbicide can be compared with that of known susceptible and resistant standards under controlled conditions. Most cases of herbicide resistance are a consequence of the repeated use of herbicides, often in association with crop monoculture and reduced cultivation practices. It is necessary, therefore, to modify these practices in order to prevent or delay the onset of resistance or to control existing resistant populations. A key objective should be the reduction in selection pressure. An integrated weed management (IWM) approach is required, in which as many tactics as possible are used to combat weeds. In this way, less reliance is placed on herbicides and so selection pressure should be reduced.&lt;ref name=moss /&gt;

Optimising herbicide input to the economic threshold level should avoid the unnecessary use of herbicides and reduce selection pressure. Herbicides should be used to their greatest potential by ensuring that the timing, dose, application method, soil and climatic conditions are optimal for good activity. In the UK, partially resistant grass weeds such as ''Alopecurus myosuroides'' (blackgrass) and ''Avena'' spp. (wild oat) can often be controlled adequately when herbicides are applied at the 2-3 leaf stage, whereas later applications at the 2-3 tiller stage can fail badly. Patch spraying, or applying herbicide to only the badly infested areas of fields, is another means of reducing total herbicide use.&lt;ref name=moss /&gt;

=== Approaches to treating resistant weeds===

====Alternative herbicides====
When resistance is first suspected or confirmed, the efficacy of alternatives is likely to be the first consideration. The use of alternative herbicides which remain effective on resistant populations can be a successful strategy, at least in the short term. The effectiveness of alternative herbicides will be highly dependent on the extent of cross-resistance. If there is resistance to a single group of herbicides, then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution, at least in the short term. For example, many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate. If resistance extends to more than one herbicide group, then choices are more limited. It should not be assumed that resistance will automatically extend to all herbicides with the same mode of action, although it is wise to assume this until proved otherwise. In many weeds the degree of cross-resistance between the five groups of ALS inhibitors varies considerably. Much will depend on the resistance mechanisms present, and it should not be assumed that these will necessarily be the same in different populations of the same species. These differences are due, at least in part, to the existence of different mutations conferring target site resistance. Consequently, selection for different mutations may result in different patterns of cross-resistance. Enhanced metabolism can affect even closely related herbicides to differing degrees. For example, populations of ''Alopecurus myosuroides'' (blackgrass) with an enhanced metabolism mechanism show resistance to pendimethalin but not to trifluralin, despite both being [[dinitroaniline]]s. This is due to differences in the vulnerability of these two herbicides to oxidative metabolism. Consequently, care is needed when trying to predict the efficacy of alternative herbicides.&lt;ref name=moss&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=S. R.|editor1-last=Naylor,|editor1-first=R. E. L.|title=Weed management handbook|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|isbn=978-0-632-05732-0|pages=225–252|edition=9th|chapter=Herbicide-Resistant Weeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mixtures and sequences====
The use of two or more herbicides which have differing modes of action can reduce the selection for resistant genotypes. Ideally, each component in a mixture should:
* Be active at different target sites
* Have a high level of efficacy
* Be detoxified by different biochemical pathways
* Have similar persistence in the soil (if it is a residual herbicide)
* Exert negative cross-resistance
* Synergise the activity of the other component
No mixture is likely to have all these attributes, but the first two listed are the most important. There is a risk that mixtures will select for resistance to both components in the longer term. One practical advantage of sequences of two herbicides compared with mixtures is that a better appraisal of the efficacy of each herbicide component is possible, provided that sufficient time elapses between each application. A disadvantage with sequences is that two separate applications have to be made and it is possible that the later application will be less effective on weeds surviving the first application. If these are resistant, then the second herbicide in the sequence may increase selection for resistant individuals by killing the susceptible plants which were damaged but not killed by the first application, but allowing the larger, less affected, resistant plants to survive. This has been cited as one reason why ALS-resistant ''Stellaria media'' has evolved in Scotland recently (2000), despite the regular use of a sequence incorporating mecoprop, a herbicide with a different mode of action.&lt;ref name=moss /&gt;

====Herbicide rotations====
Rotation of herbicides from different chemical groups in successive years should reduce selection for resistance. This is a key element in most resistance prevention programmes. The value of this approach depends on the extent of cross-resistance, and whether multiple resistance occurs owing to the presence of several different resistance mechanisms. A practical problem can be the lack of awareness by farmers of the different groups of herbicides that exist. In Australia a scheme has been introduced in which identifying letters are included on the product label as a means of enabling farmers to distinguish products with different modes of action.&lt;ref name=moss /&gt;

=== Farming practices and resistance: a case study===
Herbicide resistance became a critical problem in [[Australia]]n agriculture, after many Australian sheep farmers began to exclusively grow wheat in their pastures in the 1970s.  Introduced varieties of [[ryegrass]], while good for grazing sheep, compete intensely with wheat. Ryegrasses produce so many seeds that, if left unchecked, they can completely choke a field. Herbicides provided excellent control, while reducing soil disrupting because of less need to plough. Within little more than a decade, ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance. In response Australian farmers changed methods.&lt;ref name=s1408&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.734| title = The War Against Weeds Down Under| journal = Science| volume = 341| issue = 6147| pages = 734–736| year = 2013| last1 = Stokstad | first1 = E.| pmid=23950526}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, patches of ryegrass had become immune to Hoegrass, a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called [[acetyl coenzyme A]] [[carboxylase]].&lt;ref name=s1408/&gt;

Ryegrass populations were large, and had substantial genetic diversity, because farmers had planted many varieties. Ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind, so genes shuffle frequently. To control its distribution farmers sprayed inexpensive Hoegrass, creating [[selection pressure]].  In addition, farmers sometimes diluted the herbicide in order to save money, which allowed some plants to survive application.  When resistance appeared farmers turned to a group of herbicides that block [[acetolactate synthase]].  Once again, ryegrass in Australia evolved a kind of "cross-resistance" that allowed it to rapidly break down a variety of herbicides. Four classes of herbicides become ineffective within a few years. In 2013 only two herbicide classes, called [[Photosystem II]] and [[long-chain fatty acid]] inhibitors, were effective against ryegrass.&lt;ref name=s1408/&gt;

==List of common herbicides==

===Synthetic herbicides===
* [[2,4-D]] is a broadleaf herbicide in the phenoxy group used in turf and no-till field crop production. Now, it is mainly used in a blend with other herbicides to allow lower rates of herbicides to be used; it is the most widely used herbicide in the world, and third most commonly used in the United States. It is an example of synthetic [[auxin]] (plant hormone).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

* [[Metolachlor]] is a pre-emergent herbicide widely used for control of annual grasses in corn and sorghum; it has displaced some of the [[atrazine]] in these uses.
* [[Paraquat]] is a nonselective contact herbicide used for no-till burndown and in aerial destruction of marijuana and coca plantings. It is more acutely toxic to people than any other herbicide in widespread commercial use.
* [[Pendimethalin]], a pre-emergent herbicide, is widely used to control annual grasses and some broad-leaf weeds in a wide range of crops, including corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, many tree and vine crops, and many turfgrass species.
* [[Picloram]], a pyridine herbicide, mainly is used to control unwanted trees in pastures and edges of fields. It is another synthetic auxin.
* [[Sodium chlorate]] ''(disused/banned in some countries)'', a nonselective herbicide, is considered phytotoxic to all green plant parts. It can also kill through root absorption.
* [[Triclopyr]], a systemic, foliar herbicide in the pyridine group, is used to control broadleaf weeds while leaving grasses and conifers unaffected.
* Several [[sulfonylurea#Herbicides|sulfonylurea]]s, including [[Flazasulfuron]] and [[Metsulfuron-methyl]], which act as ALS inhibitors and in some cases are taken up from the soil via the roots.

===Organic herbicides===
Recently, the term "organic" has come to imply products used in [[organic farming]]. Under this definition, an organic herbicide is one that can be used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic. Depending on the application, they may be less effective than synthetic herbicides{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and are generally used along with cultural and [[mechanical weed control]] practices.

Homemade organic herbicides include:
* Corn gluten meal (CGM) is a natural pre-emergence weed control used in turfgrass, which reduces germination of many broadleaf and grass weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0889189300008778|title=Corn gluten meal—a natural preemergence herbicide: Effect on vegetable seedling survival and weed cover|year=2009|last1=McDade|first1=Melissa C.|last2=Christians|first2=Nick E.|journal=American Journal of Alternative Agriculture|volume=15|issue=4|pages=189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of historical interest and other===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
* [[2,4,5-T|2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) was a widely used broadleaf herbicide until being phased out starting in the late 1970s. While 2,4,5-T itself is of only moderate toxicity, the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-T contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD). TCDD is extremely toxic to humans. With proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-T, TCDD levels can be held to about .005 ppm. Before the TCDD risk was well understood, early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls. Individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of TCDD. 2,4,5-T was withdrawn from use in the USA in 1983, at a time of heightened public sensitivity about chemical hazards in the environment. Public concern about [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] was high, and production and use of other (non-herbicide) chemicals potentially containing TCDD contamination was also withdrawn. These included [[pentachlorophenol]] (a wood preservative) and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] (mainly used as stabilizing agents in transformer oil). Some feel {{Who|date=July 2010}} that the 2,4,5-T withdrawal was not based on sound science. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by [[dicamba]] and [[triclopyr]].
* [[Agent Orange]] was a herbicide blend used by the [[British military]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[U.S. military]] during the [[Vietnam War]] between January 1965 and April 1970 as a defoliant. It was a 50/50 mixture of the ''n''-butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. Because of TCDD contamination in the 2,4,5-T component,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} it has been blamed for serious illnesses in many people who were exposed to it.
* [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]], and other [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] derivatives, are known to be informally used at times, but are usually banned for this purpose.

'''Immunocomputing''' explores the principles of [[information processing]] that '''[[proteins]]''' and '''immune networks''' utilize in order to solve specific complex problems while protected from viruses, noise, errors and intrusions.

It intends to establish:

* A proper mathematical framework
* A new kind of [[computing]]
* A new kind of hardware

The main difference with other kinds of computing lay on the function of its ''basic element'', the '''formal protein''', defined according with its biological prototype and its [[mathematical model]]. 

The main [[biophysics|biophysical issues]] considered in immunocomputing are:

* Free '''[[Protein folding|folding]]''' to a stable state (inspiration for the Formal Protein)
* Free '''binding''' with other elements dependent on their reciprocal states (inspiration for the [[Immune network theory|Formal Immune Networks]])

'''Formal immune networks''' (FINs) have as closest model the ''idiotypic network'' of ''[[Niels Kaj Jerne|N. Jerne]]'' but they consider specific mechanisms of [[Protein-protein interaction|interactions between proteins]]. FINs are able to learn, recognize and solve problems.

Gold is used for its high [[electron density]] which increases [[electron]] scatter to give high contrast 'dark spots'.&lt;ref name="Alb08"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts |first=Bruce|title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2008|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-4106-7|edition=5th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First used in 1971, immunogold labeling has been applied to both [[transmission electron microscopy]] and [[scanning electron microscopy]], as well as [[brightfield microscopy]]. The labeling technique can be adapted to distinguish multiple objects by using differently-sized gold particles.

Immunogold labeling can introduce artifacts, as the gold particles reside some distance from the labelled object and very thin sectioning is required during sample preparation.&lt;ref name="Alb08" /&gt;

==History==
Immunogold labeling was first used in 1971 by Faulk and Taylor to identify ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[antigens]].&lt;ref name="EBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ichem"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faulk WP, Taylor GM |title=An immunocolloid method for the electron microscope |journal=Immunochemistry |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1081–3 |date=November 1971 |doi= 10.1016/0019-2791(71)90496-4|pmid=4110101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first applied in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and was especially useful in highlighting [[protein]]s found in low densities, such as some cell surface antigens.&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hermann R, Walther P, Müller M |title=Immunogold labeling in scanning electron microscopy  |journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=31–39 |year=1996 |pmid=8858365 |doi=10.1007/BF02473200 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/46j3464m67861075/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the resolution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) increased, so too did the need for nanoparticle-sized labels such as immunogold. In 1975, Horisberger and coworkers successfully visualised gold nanoparticles with a diameter of less than 30&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref name="JHC"/&gt;
and this soon became an established SEM technique.&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;

== Technique ==
First, a thin section of the sample is cut, often using a [[microtome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A study in Microtomy for Electron Microscopy|journal=The Anatomical Record|year=1953|volume=117|number=4|author1=Porter, K  |author2=Blum, J|doi=10.1002/ar.1091170403|pages=685–710|pmid=13124776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other stages of [[Electron microscope#Sample preparation|sample preparation]] may then take place.

The prepared sample is then incubated with a specific antibody designed to bind the molecule of interest.&lt;ref name="Alb08" /&gt; Next, a secondary antibody which has gold particles attached is added, and it binds to the primary antibody. Gold can also be attached to [[protein A]] or [[protein G]] instead of a secondary antibody, as these proteins bind mammalian [[IgG]] [[Fc region]]s in a non-specific way.&lt;ref name="JHC"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/26.12.366014 |vauthors=Roth J, Bendayan M, Orci L |title=Ultrastructural localization of intracellular antigens by the use of protein A-gold complex |journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1074–81 |date=December 1978 |pmid=366014  |url=http://www.jhc.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/12/1074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electron-dense gold particle can now be seen under an electron microscope as a black dot, indirectly labeling the molecule of interest.&lt;ref name="Alb08" /&gt;

==Labeling multiple objects==
Immunogold labeling can be used to visualize more than one target simultaneously. This can be achieved in [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] by using two different-sized gold particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth J, Binder M |title=Coloidal gold, ferritin and peroxidase as markers for electron microscopic double labeling lectin techniques |journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=163–9 |date=March 1978 |pmid=632554 |doi= 10.1177/26.3.632554|url=http://www.jhc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=632554 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of this method used three different sized gold particles to track the localisation of regulatory [[peptides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tapia FJ, Varndell IM, Probert L, De Mey J, Polak JM |title=Double immunogold staining method for the simultaneous ultrastructural localization of regulatory peptides |journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=977–81 |date=July 1983 |pmid=6189888 |doi= 10.1177/31.7.6189888|url=http://www.jhc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6189888 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complex method of multi-site labeling involves labeling opposite sides of an [[antigen|antigenic site]] separately, the immunogold particles attached to both sides can then be viewed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bendayan M |title=Double immunocytochemical labeling applying the protein A-gold technique |journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=81–5 |date=January 1982 |pmid=6172469 |doi= 10.1177/30.1.6172469|url=http://www.jhc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6172469 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in brightfield microscopy==
Although immunogold labeling is typically used for transmission electron microscopy, when the gold is 'silver-enhanced' it can be seen using [[brightfield microscopy]].&lt;ref name = "VanLaere_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Laere O, De Wael L, De Mey J |title=Immuno gold staining (IGS) and immuno gold silver staining (IGSS) for the identification of the plant pathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al |journal=Histochemistry |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=397–9 |year=1985 |pmid=2416717 |doi= 10.1007/BF00509198|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver enhancement increases the particle size, also making scanning electron microscopy possible. In order to produce the silver-enhanced gold particles, colloidal gold particles are placed in an [[acidic]] enhancing [[solution]] containing silver [[ion]]s. Gold particles then act as a [[nucleation]] site and silver is deposited onto the particle. An example of the application of silver-enhanced immunogold labeling (IGSS) was in the identification of the [[pathogen]] ''[[Erwinia amylovora]]''.&lt;ref name = "VanLaere_et_al"/&gt;

==Limitations==
An inherent limitation to the immunogold technique is that the gold particle is around 15-30&amp;nbsp;nm away from the site to which the primary antibody is bound&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt; (when using a [[primary and secondary antibodies]] labeling strategy). The precise location of the targeted molecule can therefore not be accurately calculated. Gold particles can be created with a diameter of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] (or lower) but another limitation is then realized—at these sizes the gold label becomes hard to distinguish from tissue structure.&lt;ref name="EBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BG" /&gt;

Thin sections are required for immunogold labeling and these can produce misleading images; a thin slice of a cell component may not give an accurate view of its [[Tertiary structure#Tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]]. For example, a [[microtubule]] may appear as a 'spike' depending on which plane the sectioning occurred. To overcome this limitation serial sections can be taken, which can then be compiled into a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image.&lt;ref name="Alb08" /&gt;

A further limitation is that antibodies and gold particles cannot penetrate the [[resin]] used to embed samples for imaging. Thus, only accessible molecules can be targeted and visualized. Labeling prior to embedding the sample can reduce the negative impact of this limitation.&lt;ref name="Alb08" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Language exposure''' is the act of making language readily available to children during the critical early years of [[language learning]]. The theory of the [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] for language exposure states that there is a certain window where children are able to and must learn a [[first language]], or multiple languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This exposure allows the brain to fully develop linguistic skills and leads to [[language fluency]] and [[language comprehension|comprehension]] later in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Early language acquisition and adult language ability: What sign language reveals about the critical."&amp;nbsp;The Oxford handbook of deaf studies, language, and education&amp;nbsp;2 (2010): 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of the research on language exposure, the critical period, and [[language acquisition]] are based on spoken languages and children who are hearing. In reality, these same ideas translate to deaf children as well. Language exposure is essential during the critical period for language acquisition for all children. Deaf children tend to face more hardships when it comes to ensuring that they will receive this input of language in formative years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Language and development==
[[American Sign Language]] has only fairly recently been recognized as an official language. This recognition came about with research done around the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=991858|title=LibGuides. Sign Language. ASL: Academic acceptance and official recognition.|last=Henry|first=Sarah Hamrick, Laura Jacobi, Patrick Oberholtzer, Elizabeth|website=libguides.gallaudet.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proved that signed languages are in fact technical languages, with structure and [[grammar]] to match that of spoken language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Meier, Richard P. "Language acquisition by deaf children."&amp;nbsp;American Scientist&amp;nbsp;79.1 (1991): 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, manual and verbal languages are all indeed full languages, with common properties like [[syntax]] and grammar. They both also use the same area of the brain in the [[left hemisphere]]. For years it was known that the left hemisphere dealt with speech, but now it is specifically the details of language organization that seem to be processed here.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Speech-like cerebral activity in profoundly deaf people processing signed languages: implications for the neural basis of human language."&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&amp;nbsp;97.25 (2000): 13961-13966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaf brain develops at the same rate as the hearing brain when learning language. Deaf babies [[Babbling|babble]] on their hands the same way hearing babies babble with their mouths,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and they acquire language in the same timeframe. This is true neurologically and behaviorally. In both areas they hit the same milestones around the same times.

Developments other than linguistic development, such as [[cognitive development]]s, actually develop independent of whether or not the deaf child is exposed to, learns, or develops language at all. Deaf children's bodies and minds develop normally outside of language ability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Cognitive development in deaf children: The interface of language and perception in neuropsychology."&amp;nbsp;''Handbook of neuropsychology''&amp;nbsp;8.Part II (2002): 71-107.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the lack of exposure to language, although independent of other developmental processes, is a problem for many deaf children, as language development is still crucial. Deaf children are an at-risk population for not receiving language during the critical period for learning language. This can be due to schooling options, their parent's inability to communicate, or lack of continuous and unlimited exposure to [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Humphries, Tom, et al. "Ensuring language acquisition for deaf children: What linguists can do."&amp;nbsp;Language&amp;nbsp;90.2 (2014): e31-e52.&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive, neurological, and regular development of children who happen to be deaf is completely normal. It is only that their access to an input language that is much more limited in comparison to a child learning a spoken language. This is due to the mainly hearing world we live in. However, if deaf children do receive that language acquisition during the critical period of language learning in the way that they're supposed to, the [[sensory loss]] of not being able to hear is not debilitating or harmful to their development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Providing language exposure ==
=== From birth ===

About 90% of deaf or hard of hearing children are born to hearing parents. Only 10% are born to deaf parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing|title=Quick Statistics About Hearing|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore only about 10% of deaf children have language exposure in their natural form of communication, without restriction, from birth. When a child is born deaf or hard of hearing, there are newborn hearing [[Newborn screening|screening]] practices that inform the parents whether or not the baby has [[hearing loss]] within the first few weeks after the baby is born. If a baby is diagnosed with hearing loss, hospitals usually provide access to a team that includes primary care physicians, audiologists, and other health care providers to help the family decide which path is most appropriate for their family or their child to ensure that the baby develops normally with language. However, some physicians report that they aren't confident about informing the parents of children who have hearing loss about the potential choices for their child&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Mary Pat; Karl R. White; and Lenore Shisler. 2006. Primary care physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to newborn hearing screening. Pediatrics 118.1357–70.&lt;/ref&gt; other than just referring them to an audiologist. Based on that, there seems to be a lack of knowledge and education about the Deaf community for physicians and families alike.  

=== Cochlear implants and exposure ===

Many doctors recommend families with babies diagnosed with hearing loss see an [[audiologist]]. On one hand, people view this referral as an attempt to fix the pathological problem of hearing loss. On the other hand, some people view the referral and denial of allowing the baby to stay deaf as an intrusion on the child's potential life in the Deaf community. This is because audiologists specializes in the perception of sound. This could lead to ignoring the possibility that the child just may need someone to help them thrive in the Deaf community. Recently, there has been heated debate over research on [[cochlear implant]]s. This surgery is a common recommendation for children born deaf or hard of hearing, in order to attempt to get the child to hear, understand, and use spoken language rather than sign language. The debate mostly centers around the view that deafness is a problem that needs to be fixed. Members of the Deaf community, proud of their culture and language, see this as an insult and excessive means of forced conformity to the hearing world. Others view it as a very real possibility to open doors and give children the opportunity to function with more accessibility in a hearing society. In regards to language exposure, there has been recent research&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Karl R.|last2=Cooper|first2=Louis Z.|date=2017-07-01|title=Opportunities and Shared Decision-Making to Help Children Who Are Deaf to Communicate|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/1/e20171287|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=140|issue=1|pages=e20171287|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-1287|issn=0031-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that when given a cochlear implant, a child's use of only spoken language leads to higher intellectual development results in comparison to children who mix spoken language learning with sign language as well. However, this research&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; does note that they haven't studied children of parents who use sign language fluently, and give their child unlimited exposure to sign. 

=== Grade school ===

Unlimited language exposure includes having education options available in one's own language. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] states that a public education should be provided to each child with a disability in the "least restrictive environment" for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65310|title=A Guide to Disability Rights Laws|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a broad statement, this is up to interpretation. Often this means that children with hearing loss get access to public schools with an interpreter. The qualifications of this interpreter are required, but since they are not stated specifically, usually [[K-12]] interpreters aren't the most qualified to be teaching a child, as those qualifications mean those interpreters are more expensive for schools to provide. Additionally, going to a public school that is a majority of hearing students isolates the deaf child and does not provide unlimited access to their language. There are few schools that teach all in sign language, such as [[The Learning Center for the Deaf]] in Framingham, MA. Other deaf schools may teach in an [[oralist]] method, prohibiting signing and focusing only on speech, a [[Total Communication|total communication]] method, with a [[Contact sign|pidgin sign language]] accompanying a speaking teacher, also known as [[simultaneous communication]], and a [[bilingual]] approach that includes both sign and speech, but in a separated way.&lt;ref&gt;Gascon-Ramos, M. (2008). Wellbeing in deaf children: A framework of understanding.&amp;nbsp;''Educational &amp; Child Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;''25''(2), 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later language ability ==
There has been other research&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; done about fluent sign language users and their ability to pick up spoken language later in life. The results show that sign language as a first language produces equal language skills later on in life, whether it be reading, learning a second language, or basic linguistic skills, as long as it is learned in the critical period of language acquisition. 

Additionally, learning sign language alongside another language has been proven to produce the same development as a bilingual child who learns two spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Bilingual signed and spoken language acquisition from birth: Implications for the mechanisms underlying early bilingual language acquisition."&amp;nbsp;Journal of child language&amp;nbsp;28.2 (2001): 453-496.&lt;/ref&gt; This furthers the idea that exposing a child to sign language is comparable to exposing a child to spoken language. Again, the criteria for both of these languages being that they are learned during the critical period and with full exposure to learn the language fluently. When any language is learned in this way, language development is the same across the board.

'''Layered security''', also known as '''layered defense''', describes the practice of combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data.

The term bears some similarity to [[Defense in Depth (computing)|defense in depth]], a term adopted from a military strategy that involves multiple layers of defense that resist rapid penetration by an attacker but yield rather than exhaust themselves by too-rigid tactics.  As the incursion progresses, resources are consumed and progress is slowed until it is halted and turned back.  The [[information assurance]] use of the term "defense in depth" assumes more than merely technical security tools deployment; it also implies policy and operations planning, user training, physical access security measures, and direct information assurance personnel involvement in dealing with attempts to gain unauthorized access to information resources.  Within a defense in depth security strategy, layered security is regarded by some{{who|date=February 2012}} as merely a delaying tactic used to buy time to bring security resources to bear to deal with a malicious security cracker's activities.

== Philosophy ==

Layered security is an example of the [[Swiss Cheese model]] (or "cumulative act effect"), used in [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and [[risk management]]. In this model, security systems are likened to multiple slices of [[swiss cheese]], stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the fact that it must pass through "holes" in the defenses (i.e. not be trapped and detected by each different defense), and these defenses are of different kinds, and locations that are "layered" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not easily allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of weakness.

=== Commercial ===

For every category of threat, there should be an effective control deployed to mitigate the threat. Security vendors will sometimes cite differing solutions, but most can be grouped under consumer or enterprise categories:

==== Consumer Layered Security Strategy ====
* [[Extended validation]] (EV) SSL certificates
* [[Multifactor authentication]] (also sometimes known as versatile or [[two-factor authentication]])
* [[Single sign-on]] (SSO)
* Fraud detection and [[risk-based authentication]]
* Transaction signing and encryption
* Secure Web and e-mail
* Open fraud intelligence network

==== Enterprise Layered Security Strategy ====
* Workstation application [[whitelisting]]
* Workstation system restore solution
* Workstation and network authentication
* File, disk and removable media encryption
* Remote access authentication
* Network folder encryption
* Secure boundary and end-to-end messaging
* Content control and policy-based encryption

==== Integrated Solutions ====

An "[[ad hoc]]" security strategy, with numerous vendors and an abundance of different, sometimes incompatible security solutions and products can leave gaps in protection, whereas a vertically integrated vendor stack could provide more comprehensive defense. Single-vendor solutions improve [[interoperability]] between [[component architecture|components]] of a complete security strategy, and may offer performance and price benefits over a multi-vendor approach.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==== Best Of Breed Solutions ====

The contrasting commercial security product argument is that a "[[best of breed]]" approach provides more effective protection.  While a single vendor's vertically integrated product stack may be the offering of choice for vendors who want to monopolize a client's or customer's business, it could also be argued that each component of a comprehensive security strategy should be evaluated both for its performance within its niche and its open compatibility with other, non-integrated components of the whole.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Legal psychology''' involves [[empirical]], [[psychology|psychological]] research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as [[eyewitness memory]], jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the [[experimental research|experimental]] focus of legal psychology from the [[clinical psychology|clinically]]-oriented [[forensic psychology]].

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as "psychology and law". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis R. Fox]] (1999). [http://dennisfox.net/papers/injustice.html Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.]''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 23,'' 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 41, the [[American Psychology-Law Society]], is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of [[psychology]] to the understanding of [[law]] and [[legal system]]s through [[research]], as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing  education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to  inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large  of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ap-ls.org/
|title=American Psychology and the Law Society
|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.

==Areas of research==
Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving [[clinical psychology]], e.g., mental illness, [[competency evaluation (law)|competency]], [[insanity defense]], [[offender profiling]], etc., is typically categorized as [[forensic psychology]], and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to [[eyewitness testimony]] and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Saks]] (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. ''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 10'', 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several legal psychology [[academic journal|journal]]s, including ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]'', ''Psychology, Crime, and Law'', and ''Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' that focus on general topics of [[criminology]], and the [[criminal justice system]]. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.

In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct.  He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never  mattered "As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Legal psychologists typically hold a [[PhD]] in some area of psychology (e.g., [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory "works", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).

A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone [[PhD]] program or a joint [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found [http://ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php here] on the website of the [http://www.ap-ls.org/ American Psychology-Law Society].

==Roles of a legal psychologist==
===Academics and research===
Many legal psychologists work as [[professors]] in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in addition to a [[PhD]]

===Expert witnesses===
{{Main|Expert witness}}
Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, [[mistaken identity]], competence to stand trial, the propensity of a [[death-qualified jury]] to also be "pro-guilt", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being "hired guns" or "stating the obvious".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Eyewitness memory experts, such as [[Elizabeth Loftus]], are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and "unrealistic" scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

===Policy making and legislative guidance===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).&lt;ref&gt;Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the [[American Bar Foundation]] ([http://www.abf-sociolegal.org/ Website]) and [[Federal Judicial Center]] ([http://www.fjc.gov Website]), among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory roles===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229052858/http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Psychologists can provide an [[amicus brief]] to the court. The [[American Psychological Association]] has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0435_0223_ZC2.html Ballew v. Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; once called a reliance on statistics "numerology" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.

===Trial consulting===
Some legal psychologists work in [[trial consulting]]. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the [[American Society of Trial Consultants]], [http://www.astcweb.org/ ASTC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring "in-house" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.

Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing "mock trials" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, [[scientific jury selection|picking juries]], and even arranging "shadow jurors" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4387">A '''Master of Physics''' (or '''MPhys (Hons)''' ) honours [[academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102074249/http://ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the MPhys is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] award available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/education/Careers/Publications/file_31428.pdf|title=Education|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]] the course has a five-year duration. In some universities, the degree has the variant abbreviation '''MSci'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/courses/physicsandastronomy/msci-physics.aspx|title=Physics MSci - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79936.html|title=MSci Physics|website=Qmul.ac.u|accessdate=2 September 2017k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/physics/physics-msci.aspx|title=Undergraduate degree course/programme in Physics MSc F302i – School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham - University of Birmingham|website=Birmingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/physics/msci-physics/|title=MSci Physics - Study at Bristol - University of Bristol|website=Bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/i-am-at-school-college/undergraduate-courses/page_57508.html|title=Undergraduate courses|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are taught courses, with a [[research]] element in the final year — this can vary from a small component to an entire year working with a research group — and are not available as [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] qualifications in most cases, although depending on institution the final year can be considered as approximately equivalent to an [[Master of Science|MSc]].

===Structure===
In terms of course structure, MPhys degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degree]]s with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

===Degree schemes===
It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, [[Lancaster University]]'s physics department offer the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/physics/ugAdmissions/index.htm|title=Physics|website=Lancs.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes:
*MPhys Physics
*MPhys Physics, [[Astrophysics]] and [[Cosmology]]
*MPhys Physics with [[Particle Physics]] and Cosmology
*MPhys Physics with [[Space Science]]
*MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics
*MPhys [[Theoretical Physics]]
*MPhys Theoretical Physics with [[Mathematics]]

These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules. Students tend to take all the same core modules during their first year and start to specialise in their second year. In some cases, optional modules can be taken from other schemes.

[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|Mock trials allow researchers to examine [[confirmation bias]]es in a realistic setting]]

A '''mock trial''' is an act or imitation [[trial (law)|trial]]. It is similar to a [[moot court]], but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates [[appellate court]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/court-moot-court-mock-court-and-mock.html Court, Moot Court, Mock Court and Mock Trial], Available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other.  Mock trial is also the name of an [[extracurricular]] program in which [[student]]s participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]], and [[law school]].  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in [[trial advocacy]] or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelawinsider.com/mock-trial-lawschool/what-is-a-mock-trial/ scholastic mock trials]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
[[Guam]] has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, [[South Korea]], and [[Saipan]] in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|the Superior Court of Guam]]. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from [[high school]]s. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MBA is Asia-Pacific invitational mock trial competition champion |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073517/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2005, the [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot]] was conceived as one of its kind  with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot trial is one of the most appreciated for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique trial competition [India North, India South, India North East &amp; India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This competition  has the distinction of being the first ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. The structure is such that  law students from the host institution participate by enacting the role of  witnesses for the oral rounds. The students and faculty welcome this, as it provides a unique opportunity to learn practical aspects of a trial, first hand.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students [[Education in Australia|years 10, 11 and 12]] from 32 schools in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/other/mock_trial.asp|publisher=The Law Society of South Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in [[Western Australia]]. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trials Competition |url=http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |publisher=The Law Society of Western Australia |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085042/http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by [[University of Canberra]]. There were teams of schools in [[Australian Capital Territory]] region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in [[New South Wales]] initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to [[New York City]] to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/forschools/mocktrial/Mocktrial|publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Jodie|title=First Asia-Australia mock trial|journal=The National Legal Eagle|date=10 January 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=18|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=nle|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the [[University of Regensburg]] organizes the REGINA Mock Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA Mock Trial: Der Gerichtssimulator|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/rechtswissenschaft/fakultaet/medien/regina/mock_trial_flyer_hp.pdf|website=University of Regensburg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial im Verwaltungsprozessrecht|url=https://www.jura.rw.fau.de/mock-trial-im-verwaltungsprozessrecht-2/|website=Fachbereich Rechtswissenschaft|publisher=Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in [[insurance law]] coordinated by the [[Fernando Peña López|Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veredicto Ejemplar|url=https://catedrafundacioninade.org/veredicto-ejemplar/2018|website=Cátedra Fundación INADE-UDC|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Bar Mock Trial}}
The Bar National Mock Trial Competition involves students to take on the roles of [[barrister]]s and [[witness]]es and present their case against teams from other schools. It has been running annually since 1991 with regional tournaments and the national final. There are 2,000 students in years 10 to 13, 300 barristers and advocates, and 90 judges involved in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar National Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/comps.php?175|publisher=Citizenship Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions primarily in Scotland, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Mock Court Project- Background|url=https://www.mockcourt.org.uk/background.php|publisher=School Mock Court Case Project SCIO|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|publisher=Scottish Legal News|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition/|publisher=DC Thomson Co Ltd|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles.  Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall.  The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] and [[affidavit]]s relevant to the case.  During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources.  In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/AMTA%20Rulebook%202012%20HL.pdf |title=American Mock Trial Association Rulebook, Page 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crf-usa.org/images/stories/mt_la/2014-15_mock_trial_team_rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each team prepares both sides of the case:  prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action.  Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense.&lt;ref name = "rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/fullrules.cfm |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm NYSBA Mock Trial] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
[[Image:Mock trial closing.jpg|thumb|A [[student]] giving his closing argument during a mock trial]]

The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, redirect and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt;

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time before hand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense’s closing argument.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Time Limits of Mock Trial Competition
!Statement/Examination/Argument
!Time Limit
|-
|Opening Statement
|5 minutes
|-
|Direct and Redirect Examination
|25 minutes

|25 minutes
|-
|Pre-Closing Preparation
|2 minutes
|-
|Closing Argument
|9 minutes
|-
|Rebuttal (Prosecution only)
|Amount of time reserved before closing
|}
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel's statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of Mock Trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection "battle" could go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. Mock Trial students receive an abridged version of [[Rules of evidence|Rules of Evidence]] to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
[[Image:Mock trial critique.jpg|thumb|left|Attorney evaluators give a critique at the end of a mock trial competition.]]

There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1-10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge's verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team’s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1-0 team will be matched with another 1-0 team).&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation.php |title=The American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Exceptions=====
Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tba.org/mocktrial/2010_stateforms/powermatching.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it's anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation_files/0809tabmanualfebruaryupdate_2-3-09.doc |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by [[American Bar Association]] suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as [[fairy tale]] mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putting on mock trials.|year=2002|publisher=Division for Public Education, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=1-59031-154-X|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/media/27617684/mocktrialguide.pdf|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple difference formats of competitions for this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as ''New Jersey Law Fair'' competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Fair for 3rd through 6thgraders|url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|publisher=The New Jersey State Bar Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030526/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. ''North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition'' uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Elementary School Mock Trial Competition|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|publisher=North Carolina Bar Association|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180514/http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|archive-date=28 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the ''New Hampshire Bar Association's Mock Trial Competition''. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition Handbook|url=http://www.nhbar.org/uploads/pdf/LRE-MT-CompetitionHandbook.pdf|publisher=New Hampshire Bar Association’s Law-Related Education Program|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the ''New Jersey Law Fair'' at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience the courtroom in a hands-on role. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court, bound by the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Mock Trial Education |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional court rooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and will usually involve teenagers as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a [[Civil case]] and a [[Criminal case]].

[[File:Mock trial team - Benet Academy.JPG|right|thumb|A high school mock trial team in [[Illinois]]]]
The [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] started in 1984.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. The 2011 Championship was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]  hosted in 2012, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] hosted in 2013, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosted in 2014, and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] is hosting in 2015. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in [[Albany, New York]] in May. The state of Maryland also does not compete in the National High School tournament, and thus has their own [[Maryland High School Mock Trial Competition|statewide mock trial competition]] similar to that of New York. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey's state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm |accessdate=October 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/about/history-and-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of the state competitions, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Competition in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Law-related Education: Mock Trial main |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmocktrial.org |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship, Inc |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegemocktrial.org |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization was founded in 1985 by Dean Richard Calkins of Drake Law School and serves as a regulator of mock trial competition at the collegiate level.  AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni.&lt;ref name="cooke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Jason |title=American Mock Trial Association |url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093720/http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 600 teams from over 350 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments.  In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 5,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/|title=History of AMTA|publisher=American Mock Trial Association|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a [[draft (sports)|sports draft]] format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys or coaches, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA.  Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="cooke1"/&gt;

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round.  The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country.  At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the "Opening Round Championship Series." Though there were once direct bids from Regionals to the National Championship Tournament, these bids no longer exist. 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when [[Stetson University]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Between 2009-2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by [[Rhodes College]] at courthouses in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis.  Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during "landmark" years, such as anniversaries of AMTA's founding in 1985.  The 2013 Championship was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the [[University of Virginia]] handling hosting duties.  The 2014 Championship was held in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], with the [[University of Central Florida]] serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the [[University of Cincinnati]], with trials held at the [[Hamilton County Courthouse (Ohio)|Hamilton County Courthouse]] in [[Cincinnati]]. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament will be hosted by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |title=Mock Trial team wins national championship |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=The Cavalier Daily |year=2006 |author=Jacqueline Minneman, Cavalier Daily Associate Editor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182406/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia's victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year's final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2-1). This was Maryland's fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5-0 to claim its first National Championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3-1-1 to win its first National Championship. This was Harvard's third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4-1 to claim the Bruins' third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2-1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU's first championship round appearance by a 4-1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes' eighth championship round appearance to date.  2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3-2 ballot decision.  With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins).  This round was also Princeton's first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0-1 ballot decision.  This marked Harvard's first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010).  2015 also marked Yale's first championship round appearance.  Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds.  (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11-3-1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row.  2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/national-championship-trial-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6-1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale's appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4-3 ballot decision. This was Miami's second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

* From 1992 until 2010, the "Maryland Rule" was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn't be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010-11 season.

======Forums and social media======
Beyond merely competitive interactions, collegiate mock trial has established a presence in cyberspace. Some mock trial teams have created forums for themselves on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Stanford Mock Trial|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200023395/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Miami Mock Trial|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/2200142332/?ref=ts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoofs of characters from various cases have even made their way onto Facebook with their very own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Joey Davis|url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001739776485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Brett Miller|url=http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001742140118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the American Mock Trial Association has a [[Twitter]] feed which provides updates on procedures and tournament results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter:  College Mock Trial @AMTAMockTrial|url=https://twitter.com/amtamocktrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable presence of collegiate mock trial on the internet is Perjuries [http://www.perjuries.com], the national online mock trial community. On Perjuries, mock trial competitors, coaches, and alumni can create user accounts and post in a wide range of forums about mock trial and mock trial related issues.  Here, participants can discuss everything from case strategy to incidents in competition that they found humorous.  Furthermore, Perjuries provides a space for competitors to post tournament results and rank their competition.  The site is wildly popular boasting over 5,000 registered users, 2,000 discussions, and nearly 88,000 posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perjuries.com|url=http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|access-date=2012-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307045832/http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several "attorneys" and several "witnesses" on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as "attorneys" for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same "problem" or "case", typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament's start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is [[Baylor Law School]], whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school's reopening in the 1920s.

==In fiction==
* In an episode of the American television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', a once-famed attorney and current law professor named G. Stanley Lazer claims that he [[acquittal|could reverse Richard Kimble's criminal conviction]] if the case went back to trial. To Kimble's chagrin, Lazer decides to prove his theory by conducting a mock trial with his students playing the prosecutor, defense lawyer, and jury in front of a live TV audience.
* In an episode of the American television show "[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]", Mike Ross, an employee of one of New York's top law firms, goes head-to-head with one of his co-workers in a mock trial.
* In the American television series ''[[Shark (U.S. TV series)|Shark]]'', the protagonist had a room on his house specially designed like a courtroom to make Mock trials before important cases. It was used in a couple of episodes.
* In the [[The Good Wife (season 1)|season 1 episode]] "Mock" of the American television show ''[[The Good Wife]]'', Will Gardner, a partner at Lockhart Gardner, presides as a judge over a law school mock trial. Additionally, in the [[The Good Wife (season 4)|season 4 episode]] "Red Team, Blue Team", Alicia and Cary, employees of Lockhart &amp; Gardner, go head-to-head with their co-workers, Will and Diane, in a mock trial. [[The Good Wife (season 6)|Season 6 episode]] "Loser Edit" also featured a mock trial involving Diane as a prosecutor.
* In an episode of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', [[Judge Reinhold]] has a [[Court show|courtroom TV show]] called [[Mock Trial with J. Reinhold]], in which he is a fake [[Judge]] and the Bluth family uses it as a trial run for their legal defense against the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]].
*In [[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies]] (Gyakuten Saiban 5 in [[Japan]]), there is a case called "Turnabout Academy" in which a mock trial ends up becoming an actual trial. The teacher that decided which script was going to be used for the mock trial was found dead after the mock trial. Juniper Woods was accused of murdering her teacher, but her friend, Athena Cykes, decided to defend her old friend in court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">'''Neoichnology''' (Greek ''néos'' „new“, ''íchnos'' „footprint“, ''logos'' „science“) is the science of footprints and traces of [[extant taxon|extant]] animals. Thus, it is a counterpart to [[paleoichnology]], which investigates tracks and traces of [[fossil]] animals.

== Neoichnological Methods ==

[[File:Experimental setup for a neoichnological study.JPG|thumb|Experimental setup for a neoichnological study working with living animals]]

=== Working with Living Animals ===
Typically, when working with living animals, a race track is prepared and covered with a substrate, which allows for the production of footprints, i.e. sand of varying moisture content,&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; clay &lt;ref name="curth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kubo" /&gt; or mud.&lt;ref name="milan2006" /&gt;  After preparation, the animal is lured or shooed over the race track. This results in the production of numerous footprints that constitute a complete track. In some cases the animal is filmed during track production in order to subsequently study the impact of the animal’s velocity or its behavior on the produced track.&lt;ref name="curth" /&gt; This poses an important advantage of working with living animals: changes in speed or direction, resting, slippage or moments of fright become visible in the produced tracks. After track production and prior to reuse, the track can be photographed, drawn or molded. Changes in the experimental setup are possible throughout the experiment, i. e. regulation of the moisture content of the substrate.  As an alternative, also tracks of free living animals can be studied in nature (i.e. nearby lakes) and without any special experimental setup.&lt;ref name="genise" /&gt; However, without the  standardized environment of the lab, matching the tracks with the behavior of the animal during track production is undoubtedly harder.

=== Working with Foot Models or Severed Limbs ===
Another field of methods is the experimental work done with foot models or severed limbs.&lt;ref name="milan2006b"&gt;Milan, J., &amp; Bromley, R. (2006). True tracks, undertracks and eroded tracks, experimental work with tetrapod tracks in laboratory and field. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology ( 231), S. 253-264.&lt;/ref&gt; With these methods, the natural behavior of the animal is excluded from the analysis. In a typical experimental setup, the prepared foot is pressed into the substrate of interest, which again allows for the production of a footprint. Other than in the methods previously mentioned, the experimenter has now the opportunity to regulate manually the pressure, direction and speed of foot touchdown. Because of that, the effects of those manipulations can be studied more directly. The layering of differently colored substrates furthermore allows to study the consequences of touchdown in lower substrate layers.

The '''North Pacific Marine Science Organization''', also called '''PICES''' (referring to the organization's status as a Pacific version of the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]]), is an intergovernmental organization that promotes and coordinates [[Oceanography|marine scientific research]] in the North [[Pacific Ocean]] and provides a mechanism for information and data exchange among scientists in its member countries.

==Legal framework==
PICES is an international [[intergovernmental organization]] established under a Convention for a North Pacific Marine Science Organization.&lt;ref&gt;PICES Convention (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Convention entered into force on 1992-03-24 with an initial membership that included the governments of [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The Convention was ratified by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on 1992-08-31 to increase membership to four countries. Although the [[Soviet Union]] had participated in the development of the Convention, it was not ratified there until 1994-12-16, by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. The [[Republic of Korea]] acceded to the Convention on 1995-7-30. The [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] and the [[Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] are located within the Convention Area (generally north of 30°N) but are not members.

==Oversight==
A Governing Council consisting of up to two delegates appointed by each member country is the primary decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;PICES Convention&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day operations of the organization are managed by the staff of the PICES Secretariat, located in Canada at the [[Institute of Ocean Sciences]] (located on [[Patricia Bay]] in [[British Columbia]]).

==History==
The idea to create a Pacific version of ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea)&lt;ref&gt;ICES, http://www.ices.dk&lt;/ref&gt; was first discussed by scientists from Canada, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States who were attending a conference, sponsored by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]], in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada in February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Tjossem 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; ICES had provided a forum since 1902 for scientists bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and its marginal seas to exchange information, conduct joint research, publish their results, and provide scientific advice about fisheries, primarily in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;ICES Convention (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of its Atlantic heritage, the nickname PICES (Pacific ICES) was adopted for the North Pacific Marine Science Organization. Informal meetings of proponents occurred sporadically through the 1980s, eventually entraining government officials into the discussion in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Tjossem 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The final text of a convention for a new marine science organization was endorsed in [[Ottawa]], Canada on 1990-12-12. A scientific planning meeting was held in [[Seattle]], USA in December 1991 to prepare for decisions made at the first annual meeting in October 1992 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;1992 PICES Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate==
The primary mandate of the organization is to promote and to coordinate marine scientific research in the North Pacific Ocean and to provide a mechanism for information and data exchange among scientists in its member country. This has been achieved through various means, but primarily by establishing major integrative scientific programs such as the PICES/GLOBEC Scientific Program on Carrying Capacity and Climate Change. The alignment of PICES with a global research program ([[GLOBEC]]) in the mid 1990s was fundamental to building the reputation of the organization in the international scientific community. Research on [[Climate change|climate]] and [[marine ecosystem]] variability, [[global warming]], [[ocean acidification]] and related topics was about to explode in the 1990s, and PICES was strategically in a position to take a significant role in exploring how oceans, atmospheres, and their biota were affected by the changes.

A fundamental difference between PICES and ICES was a much lower priority on developing assessments of [[Fishery|fisheries]] and [[fish stock]]s. International borders are much farther apart in the North Pacific compared to the northeastern Atlantic, so coastal fisheries that might compete are separated by large distances involving fewer countries. As a result, transboundary and straddling stock issues generally tend to be managed bilaterally, rather than multilaterally in the North Pacific. Research on fish stocks in PICES has generally been directed toward environmental influences on species. This has produced a naturally synergy with ICES as the expertise on different topics of fisheries science has developed.

==Committees==
Since its creation, the primary scientific directions of the organization have stemmed from its scientific committees (biological oceanography, fishery science, physical oceanography and climate, and marine environmental quality) supported by two technical committees (data exchange and monitoring). Each committee has authority to create subsidiary expert groups, with the approval of the Governing Council, to undertake the scientific work of the committees. National membership of all committees and other expert groups is determined by the delegates of each member country. Committee chairmen serve on the PICES Science Board, which is responsible for authorizing and overseeing all scientific activities of the organization.

==Scientific programs==
To facilitate cooperative research on important topics by marine scientists in member countries, PICES established two major integrative scientific programs during its first two decades. From 1995 to 2006, the PICES/GLOBEC regional programme on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity sought to improve understanding of climate variation in the North Pacific, its effect on marine ecosystems, and the productive capacity of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelder and Kim 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An important outcome of the work was learning that decadal-scale variation is dominant in the North Pacific, to the point where long-term changes are difficult to detect &lt;ref&gt;Bindoff et al. 2007, Section 5.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;  The second program on Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE) began in October 2009. Its primary goals are to understand how marine ecosystems in the North Pacific respond to climate change and human activities, to provide forecasts of ecosystem status, and to communicate the results of the program broadly.&lt;ref&gt;FUTURE 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special projects==
From time to time, member countries have asked PICES to undertake scientific studies on a particular topic of special interest to them. These differ from the regular work of the expert groups because incremental funding is typically provided to the organization to conduct the work. Recent examples, funding sources, and links to their products are listed here:
* climate regime shifts (U.S.A.)&lt;ref&gt;King 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* harmful [[algal bloom]]s (Japan)
* [[Invasive species|invasive]] marine species (Japan)&lt;ref&gt;Kestrup, Åsa M. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* survival of [[Fraser River]] sockeye [[Sockeye salmon|salmon]] (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;McKinnell et al. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* human dimension of marine ecosystem variability (Japan)
* tsunami debris (Japan)

==Ecosystem status reporting==
Recognizing the need to understand and to communicate information on variability in marine ecosystems among member countries, PICES initiated a pilot project in 2002 that would result in the publication of its first ecosystem status report.&lt;ref&gt;PICES 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, ocean climate and marine ecosystem reporting was seen as an important function of the organization so it continued with an extensive update.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnell and Dagg 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This version placed greater emphasis on basin-scale comparisons, the primary scale of interest of the organization, but the cost and effort that was required to create such a document led to simplifications. Future versions{{When|date=March 2018}} will feature greater use of automation and technology, with printed versions appearing less frequently.

==Global collaboration==
During its first decade, PICES became a major international forum for exchanging results and discussing climatic-oceanic-biotic research in the North Pacific. Awareness of the benefits of working cooperatively on scientific problems led to increasing collaboration with like-minded organizations in the North Pacific. The first occasion where PICES had a leadership role was the Beyond El Niño Conference ([[La Jolla]], USA – 2000). The results of the conference appeared in the largest special issue of ''Progress in Oceanography'' ever published &lt;ref&gt;McKinnell, S.M. et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, PICES partnered with ICES, IOC, SCOR, and others to build its scientific and organizational reputations.

==Capacity building==
[[Capacity building]] is a high priority activity in PICES&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pices.int/capacity/capacity_main.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in many other organizations. Initially, PICES focused on the need to develop capacity in those member countries with [[developing economies]], or economies in transition. The primary goals are now focused on developing young scientific talents in all member countries . This is achieved through an intern program at the Secretariat, early career scientist conferences, summer schools, travel grants to allow participation in the PICES Annual Meeting, sponsoring speakers at international conferences, and awards and recognition of deserving early career scientists.

== History of profession ==
The idea of physician extenders was conceived in 1966 by Dr. Eugene Stead at [[Duke University]], where the first [[physician assistant]] program was established. Three years later, also at Duke, Chairman of Pathology Dr. Thomas Kinney implemented the first pathologists’ assistant program.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; To date, nine accredited programs have been established across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=path /&gt;

== Education ==
Programs can apply to be NAACLS accredited&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naacls.org/Program-Directors/Fees/Procedures-for-Review-Initial-and-Continuing-Accre.aspx|title=NAACLS - National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science - Starting a NAACLS Accredited or Approved Program|website=www.naacls.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

PathA programs collectively graduate approximately 118 [[student]]s a year. As of 2010, just over 1,400 pathologists’ assistants are in practice.&lt;ref name=path /&gt; The programs vary in details, but are generally two-year programs both at the [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[master's degree|masters]] levels, and include [[didacticism|didactic]] and [[clinical medicine|clinical]] exposure. The didactic year commonly includes an education in [[clinical anatomy]], [[neuroscience]], [[physiology]], [[histology]], pathology, pathologists’ assistant (clinical correlation)- specific courses, [[medical terminology]], and inter-professional classes. Students then are placed in a clinical setting in affiliated hospitals and medical examiner's offices to learn [[prosection]] and autopsy techniques hands-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rosalindfranklin.edu/dnn/chp/home/CHP/PathologistsAssistant/tabid/1459/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713121733/http://rosalindfranklin.edu/dnn/chp/home/CHP/PathologistsAssistant/tabid/1459/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and certification ==
Pathologists' assistants have been employed in pathology labs for over 40 years. Formal training programs slowly appeared (there were four nationwide in the late 1990s). NAACLS began accrediting PathA programs in the late 1990s, and then programs slowly continued their transitions from bachelor's to master's programs as their number increased. Prior to ASCP certification, which came about in 2005, the AAPA had a [[fellow|fellowship]] status that program trained pathologists' assistants or on-the-job trained (OJT) pathologists' assistants (who could do specific coursework and 3 years of active employment) could join only based on passing a rigorous exam that parallels the current ASCP [[certification exam]]. The OJT route was eliminated at the end of 2007. The professional association uniting PAs is the American Association of Pathologists' Assistants. Part of their duties as an association is to provide [[continuing medical education]] credits (CME) in order to keep members current on advances and procedures in the field that must be completed every 3 years in order to maintain ASCP certification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27261">The '''psychology of music preference''' refers as the [[psychology|psychological factors]] behind peoples' different music preferences. Music is heard by people daily in many parts of the world, and affects people in various ways from emotion regulation to cognitive development, along with providing a means for self-expression. Music training has been shown to help improve intellectual development and ability, though no connection has been found as to how it affects emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=Glen E.|author2=Mankarious, Monika |title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood|journal=Emotion|date=October 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous studies have been conducted to show that individual personality can have an effect on music preference, mostly using personality, though a recent meta-analysis has shown that personality in itself explains little variance in music preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schäfer|first=Thomas|last2=Mehlhorn|first2=Claudia|title=Can personality traits predict musical style preferences?

== Personality and music preference ==

===Personality===
Various questionnaires have been created to both measure the big five personality traits and musical preferences. The majority of studies attempting to find the correlation between personality and musical preferences administered questionnaires to measure both traits.&lt;ref name="Zwiegenhaft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zweigenhaft|first=Richard L.|title=A Do Re Mi Encore|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=45–55|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.29.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Fagan, Patrick |author3=Furnham, Adrian |title=Personality and uses of music as predictors of preferences for music consensually classified as happy, sad, complex, and social.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1037/a0019210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Swami, Viren|author3=Furnham, Adrian|author4=Maakip, Ismail|date=1 January 2009|title=The Big Five Personality Traits and Uses of Music|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=30|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.30.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopacz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopacz|first=Malgorzata|title=Personality and music preferences: The influence of personality traits on preferences regarding musical elements|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=216–239|doi=10.1093/jmt/42.3.216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmeyer|first=Alexandra|author2=Guglhör-Rudan, Angelika |author3=Tarnai, Christian |title=What Do Music Preferences Reveal About Personality?|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rentfrow|first=Peter J.|author2=Gosling, Samuel D. |title=The do re mi's of everyday life: The structure and personality correlates of music preferences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2003|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1236–1256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.6.1236|pmid=12793587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used questionnaires to determine personality traits, and then asked participants to rate musical excerpts on scales such as liking, perceived complexity, emotions felt, and more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonneville-Roussy|first=Arielle|last2=Rentfrow|first2=Peter J.|last3=Xu|first3=Man K.|last4=Potter|first4=Jeff|title=Music through the ages: Trends in musical engagement and preferences from adolescence through middle adulthood.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033770|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=105|issue=4|pages=703–717|doi=10.1037/a0033770}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E.

In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Dave |author2=Morizot, Julien |author3=Gaudreau, Patrick|title=Personality Metatraits and Music Preferences in Adolescence: A Pilot Study|journal=International Journal of Adolescence and Youth|date=27 March 2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=289–301|doi=10.1080/02673843.2010.9748036}}&lt;/ref&gt; but each trait is still worth discussing. The personality traits have also been shown to correlate significantly with the emotional effect music has on people. Individual personality differences can help predict the emotional intensity and valence derived from music.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Openness to experience ====

Of all the traits, openness to experience has been shown to have the greatest effect upon genre preference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zwiegenhaft /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=E. C.|author2=Silvia, P.

A.|title=Music preferences and personality among Japanese university students|journal=International Journal of Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=47|issue=4|pages=259–268|doi=10.1080/00207594.2011.631544|pmid=22248342}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, reflective and complex genres included classical, blues, jazz, and folk music, while intense and rebellious genres included rock, alternative, and heavy metal music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt; One of the facets of openness to experience is aesthetic appreciation, which is why researchers generally explain the high positive correlation between openness and liking complex music.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas |author2=Fagan, Patrick |author3=Furnham, Adrian|title=Personality and uses of music as predictors of preferences for music consensually classified as happy, sad, complex, and social|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=November 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1037/a0019210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study looking at how personality traits affect music-induced emotion found that of all the traits, openness to experience was the best predictor of higher emotionally intense reactions to sad and slow music.  The most common feelings described from sad music were nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder, and openness to experience correlated positively with all these feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Thompson, William F. |author3=McIlwain, Doris |author4=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Who enjoys listening to sad music and why?|journal=Music Perception|date=February 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=311–317|doi=10.1525/mp.2012.29.3.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sad music has also been theorized to allow for greater experience of aesthetic experiences and beauty.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski thompson" /&gt;  Furthermore, open individuals show a preference for diverse musical styles, but do not prefer popular forms of contemporary music, indicating that there are limits to this openness.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli" /&gt; However, this is only true up to a certain point, as another study looked at music's ability to produce "chills" in the listeners.  Although this study found that openness was the best predictor of genre preference, there is no way to use openness to experience to predict who gets chills from music.  Instead, the only measure for that was frequency of listening to music and the self-rated value of the importance of music in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=Emily C.|author2=Silvia, Paul J. |title=Shivers and Timbres: Personality and the Experience of Chills From Music|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=7 October 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1177/1948550610386810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study examined how openness to experience and frequency of listening are related and how they affect music preference.  While listening to classical music excerpts, those rated high in openness tended to decrease in liking music faster during repeated listenings, as opposed to those scoring low in openness, who tended to like music more with repeated plays.  This suggests novelty in music is an important quality for people high in openness to experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Patrick G|author2=Schellenberg, Glen E. |title=Interactive effects of personality and frequency of exposure on liking for music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=20 October 2010|volume=50|pages=175–179|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.021|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study had people take a personality test before and after listening to classical music with and without written lyrics in front of them.  Both the music with and without lyrics showed some effect at actually changing people's self-rated personality traits, most significantly in terms of openness to experience, which showed some significant increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djikic|first=Maja|title=The effect of music and lyrics on personality|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=August 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1037/a0022313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of personality affecting music preference, here classical music altered the assessment of their own personalities and make people assess themselves as more open.

Openness to experience is also positively correlated with intellectual or cognitive use of music, which means that this individual enjoys analyzing complex musical compositions.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Furthermore, individuals more open prefer a greater number of melodic themes in a work of music.&lt;ref name="Steele young"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of myers-briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55|pmid=21866713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;

==== Conscientiousness ====
Conscientiousness is negatively correlated with intense and rebellious music, such as rock and heavy metal music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt; While previous studies have found a relationship between conscientiousness and emotional regulation, these results do not apply cross culturally—specifically, researchers did not find this relationship in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==== Extraversion ====

Extraversion is another good predictor of music genre preference and music use.  Energetic extroverts have been linked to preferences in happy, upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, extroverts tend to listen to music more and have background music present in their lives more often.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic2010" /&gt; One study compared introverts and extroverts to see who would be more easily distracted by background music with and without lyrics.  It was assumed that since extroverts listen to background music more they would be able to tune it out better, but that was proved untrue.  No matter how much music people listen to they are still equally affected and distracted by music with lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=Christina |author2=Furnham, Adrian |author3=McClelland, Alastair|title=The influence of distracting familiar vocal music on cognitive performance of introverts and extraverts|journal=Psychology of Music|date=9 November 2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=84–93|doi=10.1177/0305735611422672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheerful music with fast tempos, many melodic themes, and vocals are also preferred by extroverts.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 18" /&gt; They are more likely than others to listen to music in the background while doing other activities, such as running, being with friends, or studying.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt; This group also tends to use music to counter the monotony of everyday tasks, such as ironing.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;  In a Turkish study, researchers found that extroverts preferred rock, pop, and rap because these genres facilitated dance and movement.

Another study examined music teachers and music therapists, assuming that people who like and study music would be more extroverted.  The results showed that music teachers were definitely higher in extraversion than the general public.  Music therapists were also higher on extraversion than introversion, though they scored significantly lower than the teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita Louise|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of Myers-Briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|date=Spring 2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|pmid=21866713|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differences can probably be attributed to teaching being a profession more dependent on extraversion.

==== Agreeableness ====

Agreeable individuals preferred upbeat and conventional music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, listeners with high agreeableness displayed an intense emotional response to music which they had never before listened to.&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg" /&gt; Agreeableness is also a good predictor of the emotional intensity experienced from all types of music, both positive and negative.  Those scoring high in agreeableness tend to have more intense emotional reactions to all types of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, Glenn E. |title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neuroticism ====

The more neurotic a person is, the less likely they are to listen to intense and rebellious music (such as alternative, rock and heavy metal); they will likely prefer upbeat and conventional music, such as country, sound tracks, and pop music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, neuroticism is positively correlated with emotional use of music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Those who scored high in neuroticism were more likely to report use of music for emotional regulation and experience higher intensity of emotional affect, especially negative emotion.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==Individual and situational influences on musical preferences==
Situations have been shown to influence individual’s preferences for certain types of music. Participants in a study from 1996 provided information about what music they would prefer to listen to in given situations, and indicated that the situation greatly determined their musical preferences. For example, melancholic situations called for sad and moody music, while an arousal situation would call for loud, strong rhythm, invigorating music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Situational influences on reported musical preference|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1996|volume=15|pages=30–45|doi=10.1037/h0094081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===

Women are more likely than men to respond to music in a more emotional way.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|authorlink=Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females prefer popular music more than males.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlings|first=D.|author2=Ciancarelli, V. |title=Music Preference and the Five-Factor Model of the NEO Personality Inventory|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 October 1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–132|doi=10.1177/0305735697252003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music, researchers found that males demonstrated more of a preference for bass music than females. This preference for bass music is also correlated with [[Anti-social behavior|antisocial]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] personalities.&lt;ref name="McCown Keiser Mulhearn Williamson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCown|first=William|author2=Keiser, Ross |author3=Mulhearn, Shea |author4= Williamson, David |title=The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=1997|volume=23|issue=4|pages=543–547 |doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===

Age is a strong factor in determining music preference. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barret|first=Frederick S.|author2=Grimm, Kevin J. |author3=Robins, Richard W. |author4=Wildschut, Tim |author5=Constantine, Sedikides |author6=Janata, Petr |title=Music-evoked nostalgia: Affect, memory, and personality|journal=Emotion|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=3|pages=390–403|doi=10.1037/a0019006|pmid=20515227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of adolescent preferences of music in England, researchers found that girls regarded music as a worthwhile activity more than boys, but both boys and girls agreed that it does not need to be taught in schools. There is also evidence that preferences and opinions toward music can change with age.&lt;ref name="crowther"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowther|first=R|author2=Durkin, K |title=Sex- and age-related differences in the musical behavior, interests and attitudes towards music of 232 secondary school students|journal=Educational Studies|year=1982|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/0305569820080206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Canadian study concerning how adolescent music preferences relate to personality, researchers found that adolescents who preferred heavy music demonstrated low self-esteem, higher levels of discomfort within the family, and tended to feel rejected by others.  Adolescents who preferred light music were preoccupied with doing the proper thing, and had difficulty balancing independence with dependence. Adolescents who had eclectic music preferences had less difficulty negotiating adolescence, and were flexible using music according to mood and particular needs at the time.&lt;ref name="schwartz fouts g"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Kelly|author2=Fouts, Gregory |title=Music preferences, personality style, and developmental issues of adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=2003|volume=32|issue=3|pages=205–213|doi=10.1023/a:1022547520656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season of the year===

Season of the year can also affect preferences.  After reflecting upon fall or winter seasons, participants preferred reflective and complex music, whereas after reflecting upon summer or spring, participants preferred energetic and rhythmic music. However, "pop" music seems to have a universal appeal, despite the season.&lt;ref name=Pettijohn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettijohn|first=Terry F.|author2=Williams, Greg M. |author3=Carter, Tiffany C. |title=Music for the Seasons: Seasonal Music Preferences in College Students|journal=Current Psychology|date=26 November 2010|volume=29|issue=4|pages=328–345|doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity===

Familiarity and complexity both have interesting effects on musical preferences.  As seen in other types of artistic media, an inverted U relationship is apparent       when relating subjective complexity on liking music excerpts. Individuals like complexity to a certain degree, then begin to dislike the music when complexity gets too high. Furthermore, there is a clear positive monotonic relationship between familiarity and liking of music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Subjective complexity, familiarity, and liking for popular music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self views===

Music preferences can also be influenced by how the individual wants to be perceived, especially in males.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;  Music preferences could be used to make self-directed identity claims.  Individuals might select styles of music that reinforce their self-views. For examples, individuals with a conservative self-view preferred conventional styles of music, while individuals with an athletic self view preferred vigorous music.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;

===Mood===

Active mood is another factor that affects music preference.  Generally whether people are in a good or bad mood when they hear music affects how they feel about the type of music and also their emotional response.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski" /&gt; On that line of thinking, aggression has been shown to improve creativity and emotional intensity derived from music.  People with aggressive disorders find music to be a powerful emotional outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pool|first=Jonathan|author2=Odell-Miller, Helen |title=Aggression in music therapy and its role in creativity with reference to personality disorder|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|year=2011|volume=38|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.003|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the value people put on music and frequency of listening affects their reactions to it.  If people listen to a certain type of music and add emotional experience to songs or a genre in general, this increases the likelihood of enjoying the music and being emotionally affected by it.&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"/&gt;  This helps explain why many people might have strong reactions to music their parents listened to frequently when they were children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14512">A '''Quantum Digital Signature (QDS)''' refers to the quantum mechanical equivalent of either a classical [[digital signature]] or, more generally, a handwritten signature on a paper document. Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature is used to protect a document, such as a digital contract, against forgery by another party or by one of the participating parties.

As e-commerce has become more important in society, the need to certify the origin of exchanged information has arisen. Modern digital signatures enhance security based on the difficulty of solving a mathematical problem, such as finding the factors of large numbers (as used in the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm]]). Unfortunately, the task of solving these problems becomes feasible when a quantum computer is available (see [[Shor's algorithm]]). To face this new problem, new quantum digital signature schemes are in development to provide protection against tampering, even from parties in possession of quantum computers and using powerful quantum cheating strategies.

== Classical public-key method ==
The [[Public-key cryptography|public-key method]] of cryptography allows a sender to sign a message (often only the [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the message) with a sign key in such a way that any recipient can, using the corresponding public key, check the authenticity of the message.  To allow this, the public key is made broadly available to all potential recipients.  To make sure only the legal author of the message can validly sign the message, the public key is created from a random, private sign key, using a [[one-way function]].  This is a function that is designed such that computing the result given the input is very easy, but computing the input given the result is very difficult.  A classic example is the multiplication of two very large primes:  The multiplication is easy, but factoring the product without knowing the primes is normally considered infeasible.

:&lt;math&gt; x \mapsto f(x) &lt;/math&gt; ''easy''

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \mapsto x &lt;/math&gt; ''very difficult''

== Quantum Digital Signature ==
Like classical digital signatures, quantum digital signatures make use of asymmetric keys.  Thus, a person who wants to sign a message creates one or more pairs of sign and corresponding public keys.  In general we can divide quantum digital signature schemes into two groups:
# A scheme that creates a public quantum-bit key out of a private '''classical''' bit string:  &lt;math&gt; k \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
# A scheme that creates a public quantum-bit key out of a private '''quantum''' bit string:  &lt;math&gt; |k \rangle \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

In both cases f is a one-way quantum function that has the same properties as a classical one-way function.
That is, the result is easy to compute, but, in contrast to the classical scheme, the function is ''impossible'' to invert, even if one uses powerful quantum cheating strategies.

The most famous scheme for the first method above is provided by Gottesman and Chuang &lt;ref name="Chuang"&gt;Daniel Gottesman, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Digital Signatures'', 
[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105032v2 ''arXiv:quant-ph/0105032'' '''v2'''], (November 15, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Requirements for a good and usable signature scheme ===
Most of the requirements for a classical digital signature scheme also apply to the quantum digital signature scheme.

In detail
# The scheme has to provide security against tampering by
## The sender after the message was signed (see [[Commitment scheme|bit commitment]])
## The receiver
## A third party
# Creating a signed message has to be easy
# Every recipient has to get the same answer, when testing the message for validity (Valid, Non-Valid)
&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;Xin Lü, Deng-Guo Feng. ''Quantum Digital Signature Based on Quantum One-way Functions'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403046 ''arxiv:quant-ph/04030462'' '''v2'''], (June 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences between classical and quantum one-way functions ===

==== Nature of the one-way function ====
A classical one-way function as said above is based on a classical infeasible mathematical task, whereas a quantum one-way function exploits the uncertainty principle which makes it impossible even for a quantum computer to compute the inverse.
This is done by providing a quantum output state, with whom one cannot learn enough about the input string to reproduce it.
In case of the first group of schemes this is shown by Holevo's theorem, which says, that from a given n-qubit quantum state one cannot extract more than n classical bits of information.&lt;ref name="Holevo"&gt;Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 1st Ed.'', Cambridge University Press, '''p.531-536'''&lt;/ref&gt;
One possibility to ensure that the scheme uses less qubits for a bit string of a certain length is by using nearly orthogonal states
: &lt;math&gt; | \langle f_k|f_k' \rangle | &lt; \delta \qquad \text{ for } k \neq k' \land 0 \le \delta \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;
That gives us the possibility to induce a basis with more than two states.&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;
So to describe an information of &lt;math&gt; 2^n &lt;/math&gt; bits, we can use less than n qubits.
An example with a 3 qubit basis
:* &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle ) &lt;/math&gt;
Only m qubits are needed to describe n classical bits when &lt;math&gt; 3^m = 2^n &lt;/math&gt; holds.

Because of Holevo's theorem and the fact, that m can be much smaller than n, we can only get m bits out of the n bits message. More general, if one gets T copies of the public key he can extract at most Tm bits of the private key.
If &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is big &lt;math&gt; n-Tm &lt;/math&gt; becomes very large, which makes it impossible for a dishonest person to guess the sign key.

''Note: You cannot distinguish between non-orthogonal states, if you only have a small amount of identical states. That's how the quantum one-way functions works. ''&lt;br&gt;
''Nevertheless &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt; leaks information about the private key, in contrast to the classical public key, which forces one to get nothing or all about the private key. ''

==== Copying the public key ====
In the classical case we create a classical public key out of a classical sign key, thus it is easy to provide every potential recipient with a copy of the public key. The public key can be freely distributed.
This becomes more difficult in the quantum case, because copying a quantum state is forbidden by the no cloning theorem, as long as the state itself is unknown.&lt;ref name="Cloning"&gt;Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang. ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 1st Ed.'', Cambridge University Press,  '''p.532'''&lt;/ref&gt;
So public keys can only be created and distributed by a person who knows the exact quantum state he wants to create, thus who knows the sign key (This can be the sender or in more general a trustful institution).
Nevertheless, in contrast to the classical public key there is an upper bound for the number of public quantum keys '''T''' which can be created, without enabling one to guess the sign key and thus endangering the security of the scheme (&lt;math&gt; n-Tm  &lt;/math&gt; has to be big)

==== Public Key should be the same for every recipient (Swap Test)====
To make sure that every recipient gets identical results when testing the authenticity of a message, public keys distributed have to be the same.
This is straightforward in the classical case, because one can easily compare two classical bit strings and see if those match.
Nevertheless, in the quantum state it is more complicated.
To test, if two public quantum states are the same one has to compare the following
:&lt;math&gt; |f_k' \rangle = |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:QDS Swap test.jpg|frame|Swap test for qubits]]
This is done with the following quantum circuit which uses one [[Fredkin gate]] ''F'', one [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard gate]] ''H''  and an ancilla qubit ''a''.
First of all the ancilla qubit is set to a symmetric state &lt;math&gt; |a \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle) &lt;/math&gt;.

Right after the ancilla qubit is used as a control on the targets &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \ |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt; in a Fredkin Gate.

Furthermore, a Hadamard gate is applied on the ancilla qubit and finally the first qubit gets measured.
If both states are the same, the result &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is measured.
If both states are nearly orthogonal, the result can be either &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \ |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;

The calculation of the swap test in more detail:

The overall state
: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = |a \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle \bigg) |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; | \psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |1 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

After the '''Fredkin''' gate is applied

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(|0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |1 \rangle \mathbf {|f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle} \bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

After the '''Hadamard''' gate is applied on the first qubit

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\bigg[\bigg(|0 \rangle + |1 \rangle \bigg) |f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + \bigg(|0 \rangle - |1 \rangle \bigg)|f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

After '''sorting''' for &lt;math&gt; |0 \rangle \text{ and } |1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow |\psi \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\bigg[|0 \rangle \bigg(|f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle + |f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg) + |1 \rangle \bigg(|f_k \rangle |f_k' \rangle - |f_k' \rangle |f_k \rangle \bigg)\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

Now it is easy to see, if the states &lt;math&gt; |f_k \rangle = |f_k' \rangle \ &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \ | \psi \rangle = |0 \rangle |f_k \rangle |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, which gives us a 0 whenever it is measured.

== An example of a signing-validation process using a simplified Gottesman-Chuang scheme ==

=== Signing Process ===
[[Image:QDS Singing.jpg|thumb|right|A signing process example for a message-bit b = 0 using Gottesman-Chuang scheme]]
Let Person A (Alice) want to send a message to Person B (Bob).
Hash algorithms won't be considered, so Alice has to sign every single bit of her message. Message-Bit '''b''' &lt;math&gt; \in \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Alice chooses '''M''' pairs of private keys &lt;math&gt; \{ k_0^i,k_1^i \} \quad 1 \le i \le M &lt;/math&gt;
* All the &lt;math&gt; k_0 &lt;/math&gt; keys will be used to sign the message-bit if b = 0.
* All the &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; keys will be used to sign the message-bit if b = 1.
The function which maps &lt;math&gt; k \mapsto |f_k \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is known to all parties.
Alice now computes the corresponding public keys &lt;math&gt; \{ |f_{k_0}^i \rangle, |f_{k_1}^i \rangle \} &lt;/math&gt; and gives all of them to the recipients. She can make as many copies as she needs, but has to take care, not to endanger the security &lt;math&gt; \left( n \gg Tm  \text{ has to hold } \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

''Her level of security limits the number of identical public keys she can create''

If
* message-bit '''b = 0''', she sends all her private keys '''&lt;math&gt; k_0 &lt;/math&gt;''' along with the message-bit '''b''' to Bob
* message-bit '''b = 1''', she sends all her private keys '''&lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt;''' along with the message-bit '''b''' to Bob

''Remember: In this example Alice picks only one bit '''b''' and signs it. She has to do that for every single bit in her message ''

=== Validation Process ===
[[Image:QDS Validation.jpg|thumb|right|A validation example using Gottesman-Chuang scheme. Only one threshold is considered]]
Bob now possesses
* The message-bit '''b'''
* The corresponding private keys &lt;math&gt; k_0 \text{ or } k_1 &lt;/math&gt;
* All public keys &lt;math&gt; \{ |f_{k_0} \rangle, |f_{k_1} \rangle \} &lt;/math&gt;

Now Bob calculates &lt;math&gt; |f_{k_b} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; for all received private keys (either &lt;math&gt; k_0 \text{ or } k_1 &lt;/math&gt;).

After he has done so he makes use of the swap test to compare the calculated states with the received public keys.
Since the swap test has some probability to give the wrong answer he has to do it for all the '''M''' keys and counts how many incorrect keys he gets '''r'''. It is obvious, that '''M''' is some kind of a security parameter. It is more unlikely to validate a bit wrong for bigger '''M'''.
* If he only gets a few incorrect keys, then the bit is most probably valid, because his calculated keys and the public keys seem to be the same.
* If he gets many incorrect keys, then somebody faked the message with high probability.

== Avoid a message to be validated differently ==
One problem which arises especially for small '''M''' is, that the number of incorrect keys different recipients measure differ with probability. So to define only one threshold is not enough, because it would cause a message to be validated differently, when the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is very close to the defined threshold.

This can be prevented by defining more than one threshold.
Because the number of errors increase proportional with M, the thresholds are defined like
: '''Acceptance''' &lt;math&gt; T_{a} = c_1 M &lt;/math&gt;

: '''Rejection''' &lt;math&gt; T_{r} = c_2 M &lt;/math&gt;

* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is below &lt;math&gt; T_{a} &lt;/math&gt;, then the bit is valid with high probability
* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is above &lt;math&gt; T_{r} &lt;/math&gt;, then the bit is faked with high probability
* If the number of incorrect keys '''r''' is in-between both thresholds, then the recipient cannot be sure, if another recipient gets the same outcome, when validating the bit. Furthermore, he can't be even sure, if he validated the message right.
&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;

''If we assume perfect channels without noise, so the bit can't be changed due to the transfer, then the threshold &lt;math&gt; T_a &lt;/math&gt; can be set to zero, because the swap test passes always, when the compared states are the same''

'''RV ''Rachel Carson''''' is a research vessel owned and operated by the [[University of Maryland]]'s Center for Environmental Science, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]].

The 81-foot aluminum-hulled vessel is an extended and modified Challenger class fast research vessel, designed by marine architect Roger Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |title=Research Vessel Design |work=JMS Naval Architects &amp; Salvage Engineers |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107205725/http://jmsnet.com/rv_design.htm |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is equipped with twin 1,200 horsepower diesel engines and water jet drives which give a maximum speed of 24 knots. A [[Dynamic positioning|dynamic positioning system]] automatically maintains the vessel's position.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

The ship was built by [[Hike Metal Products]] of [[Wheatley, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="umces"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.umces.edu/research-discovery/rv-rachel-carson |title=The R/V Rachel Carson |work=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science |year=2012 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $4.6 million, and christened by [[Katie O'Malley]] on November 16, 2008, at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/CQ/V07N4/side3/ |title=New R/V Rachel Carson Commissioned |work=Chesapeake Quarterly |year=2008 |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rachel Carson'' has operated in [[Chesapeake Bay]] since early 2009, teaching estuarine sampling techniques, carrying out water quality surveys, [[plankton]] collection, [[Box corer|box coring]] operations, and deploying instrument packages.&lt;ref name="umces"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61397">The '''regulation of genetic engineering''' varies widely by country.  Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use ''[[substantial equivalence]]'' as the starting point when assessing safety, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis.  Many countries allow the import of GM food with authorization, but either do not allow its cultivation (Russia, Norway, Israel) or have provisions for cultivation, but no GM products are yet produced (Japan, South Korea).  Most countries that do not allow for GMO cultivation do permit research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/|title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms |date=22 January 2017|publisher= Law Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in 64 countries.&lt;ref name="Burlington-2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hallenbeck |first=Terri |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/27/gmo-labeling-came-pass-vermont/8166519/ |title=How GMO labeling came to pass in Vermont |work=Burlington Free Press |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2014-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.&lt;ref name=Botha&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Botha | first1 = Gerda M. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = Christopher D. | year = 2009 | title = South Africa: A case study for voluntary GM labelling | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814608007632 | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 1060–64 | doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.06.050}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and the USA labeling of GM food is voluntary,&lt;ref name=RegGMFood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/sr-sr/pubs/biotech/reg_gen_mod-eng.php|title=The Regulation of Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe all food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"&gt;John Davison (2010)"GM plants: Science, politics and EC regulations" Plant Science 178(2):94–98 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945209003112]&lt;/ref&gt;

These conclusions represent the consensus of the scientific evidence surveyed by the ICSU (2003) and they are consistent with the views of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002). These foods have been assessed for increased risks to human health by several national regulatory authorities (inter alia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and the United States) using their national food safety procedures (ICSU). To date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified crops have been discovered anywhere in the world (GM Science Review Panel). Many millions of people have consumed foods derived from GM plants—mainly maize, soybean and oilseed rape—without any observed adverse effects (ICSU)."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://genetics.org/content/188/1/11.long|title=Plant Genetics, Sustainable Agriculture and Global Food Security|first=Pamela|last=Ronald|journal=Genetics|date=May 5, 2011|volume=188|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.128553|quote="There is broad scientific consensus that genetically engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. After 14 years of cultivation and a cumulative total of 2 billion acres planted, no adverse health or environmental effects have resulted from commercialization of genetically engineered crops (Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Committee on Environmental Impacts Associated with Commercialization of Transgenic Plants, National Research Council and Division on Earth and Life Studies 2002). Both the U.S. National Research Council and the Joint Research Centre (the European Union's scientific and technical research laboratory and an integral part of the European Commission) have concluded that there is a comprehensive body of knowledge that adequately addresses the food safety issue of genetically engineered crops (Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human Health and National Research Council 2004; European Commission Joint Research Centre 2008). These and other recent reports conclude that the processes of genetic engineering and conventional breeding are no different in terms of unintended consequences to human health and the environment (European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation 2010)."|pmid=21546547|pmc=3120150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But see also:&lt;p&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://gaiapresse.ca/images/nouvelles/28563.pdf|title=A literature review on the safety assessment of genetically modified plants|first1=José L.|last1=Domingo|first2=Jordi Giné|last2=Bordonaba|journal=Environment International|date=2011|volume=37|issue=4|pages=734–742|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2011.01.003|quote="In spite of this, the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of GM plants is still limited. However, it is important to remark that for the first time, a certain equilibrium in the number of research groups suggesting, on the basis of their studies, that a number of varieties of GM products (mainly maize and soybeans) are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-GM plant, and those raising still serious concerns, was observed. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants. Anyhow, this represents a notable advance in comparison with the lack of studies published in recent years in scientific journals by those companies."|pmid=21296423}}&lt;p&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/Illusory%20Consensus%20GMOs.PDF|title=An Illusory Consensus behind GMO Health Assessment|first=Sheldon|last=Krimsky|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|pages=1–32|doi=10.1177/0162243915598381|date=2015|quote="I began this article with the testimonials from respected scientists that there is literally no scientific controversy over the health effects of GMOs.

However, safety concerns cannot, as yet, be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available.&lt;p&gt;When seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and, above all, learn from accumulating knowledge and experience. Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis.&lt;p&gt;Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit.

==History==
{{see also|History of genetic engineering}}
The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], California. The first use of [[Recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology had just been successfully accomplished by [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] and [[Herbert Boyer]] two years previously and the scientific community recognized that as well as benefits this technology could also pose some risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.185.4148.303|journal=Science|year=1974|volume=185|issue=4148|pages=303|title=Letter: Potential biohazards of recombinant DNA molecules|vauthors=Berg P, Baltimore D, Boyer HW, Cohen SN, Davis RW, Hogness DS, Nathans D, Roblin R, Watson JD, Weissman S, Zinder ND |url=http://beck2.med.harvard.edu/week13/The%20Science%20Letter.pdf|pmid=4600381|bibcode=1974Sci...185..303B|pmc=388511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA|Asilomar meeting]] recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981|journal=Proc.

The basic concepts for the safety assessment of foods derived from GMOs have been developed in close collaboration under the auspices of the OECD, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). A first joint FAO/WHO consultation in 1990 resulted in the publication of the report ‘Strategies for Assessing the Safety of  Foods Produced by Biotechnology’ in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040704145649/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/en/1990.pdf FAO/WHO Report 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on that, an international consensus was reached by the OECD’s Group of National Experts on Safety in Biotechnology, for assessing biotechnology in general, including field testing GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/science/biotechnologypolicies/2375496.pdf OECD(1992) Safety Considerations for Biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;  That Group met again in Bergen, Norway in 1992 and reached consensus on principles for evaluating the safety of GM food; its report, ‘The safety evaluation of foods derived by modern technology – concepts and principles’ was published in 1993.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;OECD(1993) Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles [http://www.oecd.org/science/biosafety-biotrack/41036698.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That report recommends conducting the safety assessment of a GM food on a case-by-case basis through comparison to an existing food with a long history of safe use. This basic concept has been refined in subsequent workshops and consultations organized by the OECD, WHO, and FAO, and the OECD in particular has taken the lead in acquiring data and developing standards for conventional foods to be used in assessing substantial equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2010) [http://www.oecd.org/env/chemicalsafetyandbiosafety/biosafety-biotrack/46815346.pdf Consensus Document on Molecular Characterisation of Plants Derived  from Modern Biotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/chemicalsafetyandbiosafety/biosafety-biotrack/consensusdocumentsfortheworkonharmonisationofregulatoryoversightinbiotechnology.htm|title=Consensus documents: work on harmonisation of regulatory oversight in biotechnology |publisher= OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] was adopted on 29 January 2000 and entered into force on 11 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bch.cbd.int/protocol/background/|title=About the Protocol|work=The Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an international treaty that governs the transfer, handling, and use of genetically modified (GM) organisms.

==In the laboratory==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Institutions that conduct certain types of scientific research must obtain permission from government authorities and ethical committees before they conduct any experiments. Universities and research institutes generally have a special committee that is responsible for approving any experiments that involve [[genetic engineering]]. Many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group. Most countries have exempt dealings for [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) that only pose a low risk. These include systems using standard laboratory strains as the hosts, [[recombinant DNA]] that does not code for a [[vertebrate]] toxin or is not derived from a [[micro-organism]] that can cause disease in humans. Exempt dealings usually do not require approval from the national regulator. GMOs that pose a low risk if certain management practices are complied with are classified as notifiable low risk dealings. The final classification is for any uses of GMOs that do not meet the previous criteria. These are known as licensed dealings and include [[cloning]] any genes that code for vertebrate toxins or using hosts that are capable of causing disease in humans. Licensed dealings require the approval of the national regulator.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Work with exempt GMOs do not need to be carried out in certified laboratories. All others must be contained in a Physical Containment level 1 (PC1) or Physical Containment level 2 (PC2) laboratories. Laboratory work with GMOs classified as low risk, which include [[knockout mice]], are carried out in PC1 lab. This is the case for modifications that do not confer an [[selective advantage|advantage]] to the animal or doesn't secrete any infectious agents. If a laboratory strain that is used isn't covered by exempt dealings or the inserted DNA could code for a pathogenic gene, it must be carried out in a PC2 laboratory.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Release==

=== Europe and United States ===
The approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology and the development and release of GMOs vary from country to country, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the United States and Europe. The U.S. regulatory policy is governed by the [[Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology]]&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;[http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ United States Regulatory Agencies Unified Biotechnology Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117144031/http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ |date=2012-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has three tenets:  "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products."&lt;ref name="Marsden"&gt;Emily Marden, Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture, 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003)[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2236&amp;context=bclr]&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Union]] by contrast enacted regulatory laws in 2003 that provided possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt; All GMOs, along with [[irradiated food]], are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA).  The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety," "freedom of choice," "labelling," and "traceability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html GMO Compass: The European Regulatory System.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814025652/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html |date=2012-08-14 }} Retrieved 28 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union has heavily contrasted its regulations and restrictions regarding genetic engineering compared to those of the United States. The European Parliament's Committee on the Environmental, Public Health, and Consumer Protection pushed forward and adopted a "safety first" principle regarding the case of GMOs, calling for any negative health consequences from GMOs to be held liable. On the other hand, the United States still takes on a less hands-on approach to the regulation of GMOs, with the FDA and USDA only looking over pesticide and plant health facets of GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Endres|first=A.

However, although the European Union has had relatively strict regulations regarding the genetically modified food,  Europe is now allowing newer versions of modified maize and other agricultural produce. Also, the level of GMO acceptance in the European Union varies across its countries with Spain and Portugal being more permissive of GMOs than France and the Nordic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa-Font|first=Montserrat|last2=Gil|first2=José M.|last3=Traill|first3=W.

In this country, the government has declared that the GMO definition (according to Directive 2001/18/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32001L0018 Directive 2001/18/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;) stipulates that foreign DNA needs to be present in an organism for it to qualify as a genetically modified organisms. Organisms that thus have the foreign DNA removed (for example via selective breeding&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/europe-s-genetically-edited-plants-stuck-in-legal-limbo-1.19028 Europe’s genetically edited plants stuck in legal limbo]&lt;/ref&gt;) do not qualify as GMO's, even if [[Genome editing|gene editing]] has thus been used to make the organism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/gene-editing-in-legal-limbo-in-europe-1.21515 Gene editing in legal limbo in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a genetically modified organism to be approved for release in the U.S., it must be assessed under the [[Plant Protection Act]] by the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) agency within the USDA and may also be assessed by the FDA and the EPA, depending on the intended use of the organism. The USDA evaluate the plants potential to become weeds, the FDA reviews plants that could enter or alter the food supply,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/Biotechnology/default.htm FDA page for GM Food]&lt;/ref&gt; and the EPA regulates genetically modified plants with pesticide properties, as well as agrochemical residues.&lt;ref name="pewtrusts2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to U.S. Regulation of Genetically Modified Food and Agricultural Biotechnology Products|work=The Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts|location=Washington, DC|year=2001|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_0901.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the EFSA reports to the [[European Commission]] who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Agricultural Ministers]]. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt;   However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are "justifiable reasons" that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case.&lt;ref name="Europa safety"&gt;"Health and Consumers: Food and feed safety."

=== Labeling ===
One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.&lt;ref name="Botha" /&gt; In Canada and the United States labeling of GM food is voluntary,&lt;ref name="RegGMFood" /&gt; while in Europe all food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt; In the US state of Oregon., voters rejected Measure 27, which would have required labeling of all genetically modified foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grobe|first=Deana|last2=Raab|first2=Carolyn|date=2004|title=Voters' Response to Labeling Genetically Engineered Foods: Oregon's Experience|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Affairs|volume=38|pages=320–331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Australia require labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/njtip/v5/n1/8/ Northwestern.edu] Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property Paper on: "Consumer Protection" Consumer Strategies and the European Market in Genetically Modified Foods&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
{{main|International trade of genetically modified foods}}

The Cartagena Protocol sets the requirements for the international trade of GMO's between countries that are signatories to it.  Any shipments contain geneticially modified organisms that are intended to be used as feed, food or for processing must be identified and a list of the transgenic events be available.

===Substantial equivalence===
{{main|Substantial equivalence}}
"Substantial equivalence" is a starting point for the safety assessment for GM foods that is widely used by national and international agencies—including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the [[World Health Organization]] and the OECD.&lt;ref name="whybiotech.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120450/http://foodsafety.ksu.edu/en/article-details.php?a=3&amp;c=17&amp;sc=131&amp;id=497 Substantial Equivalence in Food Safety Assessment, Council for Biotechnology Information, March 11, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

A quote from FAO, one of the agencies that developed the concept, is useful for defining it: "Substantial equivalence embodies the concept that if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety (i.e., the food or food component can be concluded to be as safe as the conventional food or food component)".&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Biotechnology and Food Safety.  Rome, Italy, 30 September to 4 October 1996 [ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/esn/food/biotechnology.pdf] p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of substantial equivalence also recognises the fact that existing foods often contain toxic components (usually called antinutrients) and are still able to be consumed safely—in practice there is some tolerable chemical risk taken with all foods, so a comparative method for assessing safety needs to be adopted. For instance, potatoes and tomatoes can contain toxic levels of respectively, solanine and alpha-tomatine alkaloids.&lt;ref name=OECD2000&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Report of the Task Force for the Safety of Novel Foods and Feeds C(2000)86/ADD1.  May 17, 2000 [http://www.biosafety.be/ARGMO/Documents/report_taskforce.pdf] Quote: "Much experience has been gained in the safety assessment of the first generation of foods derived through modern biotechnology, and those countries that have conducted assessments are confident that those GM foods they have approved are as safe as other foods."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=W. K.|last2=Haslberger|first2=A. G.|title=Substantial equivalence of antinutrients and inherent plant toxins in genetically modified novel foods|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=1 June 2000|volume=38|issue=6|pages=473–83|issn=0278-6915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To decide if a modified product is substantially equivalent, the product is tested by the manufacturer for unexpected changes in a limited set of components such as toxins, nutrients, or allergens that are present in the unmodified food.  The manufacturer's data is then assessed by a regulatory agency, such as the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]. That data, along with data on the genetic modification itself and resulting proteins (or lack of protein), is submitted to regulators.  If regulators determine that the submitted data show no significant difference between the modified and unmodified products, then the regulators will generally not require further food safety testing.  However, if the product has no natural equivalent, or shows significant differences from the unmodified food, or for other reasons that regulators may have (for instance, if a gene produces a protein that had not been a food component before), the regulators may require that further safety testing be carried out.&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt;

A 2003 review in ''Trends in Biotechnology'' identified seven main parts of a standard safety test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kok EJ, Kuiper HA |title=Comparative safety assessment for biotech crops |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=439–44 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14512230 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Study of the introduced DNA and the new proteins or metabolites that it produces;
# Analysis of the chemical composition of the relevant plant parts, measuring nutrients, anti-nutrients as well as any natural toxins or known allergens;
# Assess the risk of gene transfer from the food to microorganisms in the human gut;
# Study the possibility that any new components in the food might be allergens;
# Estimate how much of a normal diet the food will make up;
# Estimate any toxicological or nutritional problems revealed by this data in light of data on equivalent foods;
# Additional animal toxicity tests if there is the possibility that the food might pose a risk.

There has been discussion about applying new [[biochemical]] concepts and methods in evaluating substantial equivalence, such as metabolic profiling and protein profiling.  These concepts refer, respectively, to the complete measured biochemical spectrum (total fingerprint) of compounds (metabolites) or of proteins present in a food or crop.  The goal would be to compare overall the biochemical profile of a new food to an existing food to see if the new food's profile falls within the range of natural variation already exhibited by the profile of existing foods or crops.  However, these techniques are not considered sufficiently evaluated, and standards have not yet been developed, to apply them.&lt;ref&gt;FAO.  Safety aspects of genetically modified foods of plant origin – Consultations 4. Approaches to the Nutritional and Food Safety Evaluation of Genetically Modified Foods[www.fao.org/wairdocs/ae584e/ae584e04.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetically modified animals==

[[Transgenic animals]] have genetically modified DNA. Animals are different from plants in a variety of ways—biology, life cycles, or potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=J.D|title=Opinion: A new paradigm for regulating genetically engineered animals that are used as food|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2016|volume=113|issue=13|pages=3410–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1602474113|pmid=27035930|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602474113|pmc=4822638|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.3410M}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM plants and animals were being developed around the same time, but due to the complexity of their biology and inefficiency with laboratory equipment use, their appearance in the market was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vàzquez-Salat|first1=Núria|title=Are good ideas enough?

{{see|Index of sociology of food articles}}
'''Sociology of food''' is the study of [[food]] as it relates to the history, progression, and future development of [[society]]. This includes production, consumption, distribution, conflict, medical application, ritual, spiritual, ethical, and cultural applications, environmental and labor issues.

The aspect of food distribution in our society can be examined through the analysis of the changes in the food supply chain. Globalization in particular, has significant effects on the food supply chain by enabling scale effect in the food distribution industry.

{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}

== Food Distribution ==

=== Impact from scale effects ===
[[Scale effects]] resulting from centralized acquisition purchase centres in the food supply chain favor large players such as big retailers or distributors in the food distribution market. This is due to the fact that they can utilize their strong market power and financial advantage over smaller players. Having both strong market power and greater access to the financial credit market meant that they can impose barriers to entry and cement their position in the food distribution market. This would result in a food distribution chain that is characterized by large players on one end and small players choosing niche markets to operate in on the other end. The existence of smaller players in specialized food distribution markets could be attributed to their shrinking market share and their inability to compete with the larger players due to the scale effects. Through this mechanism, globalization has displaced smaller role players.&lt;ref&gt;MANUEL BELO MOREIRA, Changes in Food Chains in the Context of Globalization, Int. Jrnl. of Soc. of Agr. &amp; Food, Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 134–148&lt;/ref&gt;
Another mechanism troubling the specialized food distribution markets is the ability of distribution chains to possess their own brand. Stores with their own brand are able to combat price wars between competitors by lowering the price of their own brand, thus making consumers more likely to purchase goods from them.&lt;ref&gt;Vizard, Sarah. "Supermarkets' new price war risks damaging relations with food brands and consumers." Marketing Week Online 24 Apr. 2014. General OneFile. Web. 5 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early History and Culture===
Since the beginning of mankind, food was important simply for the purpose of nourishment. As primates walked the Earth, they solely consumed food for a source of energy as they had to hunt and forage because food was not easily on hand. By early humans fending for themselves, they had figured out that they needed a high energy diet to keep going on a daily basis to survive.

These developments eventually lead to agriculture, which also goes into the labor for food and the economic part of the sociology of food. As the years went on, food become more and more of a way to bring cultures and people together. In many cultures, food is what brings people together. This carried for centuries. From the homo-sapiens hunting and gathering, to the colonists to the New World sharing a feast with the Native Americans (that carried on as a tradition named Thanksgiving), to the popularization of restaurants/eating out in the last several decades and the togetherness that comes with eating, shows how the communication and connectivity that comes from it. According to sociologists there are different groups of food that are divided up due to their purpose and meaning. There are cultural super foods, which are the stables for a culture. There are prestige foods, which often reflects economic status, body image food which is mainly consumed for the good of the body. Another would be sympathetic foods that are eaten for their desirable properties, like a superstitious property.  Lastly, there is physiologic group, which are consumed for a specific category (like what a pregnant woman eats for a healthy pregnancy). These different categories help researchers and sociologists study culture in the perspective of food. It often shows how food grows, molds and changes with society. For example, if someone believes in homeopathy, that would fall under the sympathetic foods or physiologic foods. This is because they are consumed for their properties and beliefs of what it could do. Another example of one of these categories of foods would be caviar or oysters for the prestige foods, because they are often more expensive and those who consume it and purchase it do so to show their socioeconomic status, or [[Socioeconomic status|SES]].

=== Sociological Perspectives ===
Through the lens of a symbolic interactionist, there are many symbols that have to do with the sociology of food. Food, in many cultures, brings people together and connects them on multiple different levels. For example, the tradition of eating with the family around the table. It represents togetherness with one and another and communication. Food itself could symbolize something greater than what it is. In America, fast food could represent the busy family that needs a quick dinner to some. To others, however, it could display the “McDonaldization Theory” which centers around the idea of, specifically American, consumption. Another example of how the sociology of food can be symbolized would be making the food from scratch. This definitely goes along with the family. With other theories of sociology, conflict theory also pertains to the sociology of food. As mentioned before, food was first and foremost used for nourishment and means of survival. Due to this, that can fall under conflict theory. The roles of the hunter and gather meant that early humans had to fight and forage to survive. The conflict could also display the survival of the fittest, because there was a conflict for getting food and nourishment, the only the ones who were to best for prevail and provide nourishment for themselves and their families. This evolved to what it is today, with people having jobs to make a living for themselves, which goes into food and nourishment.

=== Psychology and Disorders ===
Eating disorders are also symbolic with the sociology of food. They represent how control (or lack thereof) someone can have over themselves about one of the things they need to live. Eating disorders do not limit themselves to anorexia. These disorders include bulimia and binge eating as well. Some people often use food a comfort, or even a reward. Or in other cases they see food as a negative thing to avoid, even though they need it for survival. The relationships with food that people carry is a very large subject that is very complex. From a sociological standpoint, media has a lot to do with this. Not only does this have to with the sociology of food, but it has to do with how the media represents society as a whole. Both men and women, but majority women, see the representation on the media, leading them to wanting to feel attractive. A lot of the time, this comes down the person’s relationship with food. When someone has a disorder like [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia nervousa]] or [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], they have an intense fear of gaining weight, or just the “fatness” they feel they would get by consuming food. With bulimia, the fear is there, with the overcoming urge to binge. These disorders display the psychological relationships that people could have with food, and view it as a negative thing. They focus on the material look of themselves as opposed to needing food for energy and nourishment. This has a lot to do with overwhelming sexuality in the media. Girls, young women, and even men see how they “should” look according to the media, making them turn to desperate measures with these eating disorders.

=== Dieting ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}The fad of diets have been around for centuries, but the obsession with being thin and slim is only recently became a hot topic, within the last century. Dating back to even before the renaissance, it was considered beautiful to be “plump” and curvy. Society during that time in history believed that if a woman was larger and more plump, then she was being taken care of. It showed her wealth because she could afford to eat, as opposed to a peasant who did not have the luxury to readily available meals. The desired woman was not stick thin. The notable change began in the 1920s era were the “boyish” figure became the most desired for a woman. Later, going into the 1960s, models like Twiggy made headlines about how thin she was, and many women strived to be like her body type. This carried on to the 1980s where dieting (like the South Beach Diet and Weight Watchers) grew in popularity, along with the popularization of working out and work out videos. This was the start of mainstream dieting fads. Among these, others like the [[Atkins diet]], Jenny Craig, and [[Paleolithic diet|paleo]] began to take popularity. As of early-mid-2010s, other diets became mainstream. This included vegetarianism, dairy-free, [[veganism]], raw diets, and gluten-free. There are many reasons why someone would choose a certain type of diet: moral reasons, digestive issues, outside influence, or religious influence.

=== Obesity===
The obesity epidemic that has spread across America also is a great example on how food shapes society and they way people live, along with the evolution of  the type of food Americans consume. Due to the busy manic lives that many Americans have, fast food and prepackaged foods with higher calories have gained popularity and have become mainstream in American consumption. The environment in which people with certain socioeconomic backgrounds live also heavily affect the type of food they consume. High calorie and low nutritional food tend to be less expensive and are easier to access. Thus, when shopping for food many lean towards the cheaper options. Lack of physical fitness is also a crucial aspect that is adding to the obesity epidemic. Studies have found that there is a direct correlation between walkability in neighborhoods and exercise. Also, if one's neighborhood does not have ready access to recreation activities they are at risk of becoming over weight and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SALLIS|first=JAMES F.|last2=GLANZ|first2=KAREN|date=2009-03|title=Physical Activity and Food Environments: Solutions to the Obesity Epidemic|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=123–154|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00550.x|issn=0887-378X|pmc=2879180|pmid=19298418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going along with the subject of eating disorders, obesity could have to do with the feeling of lack of control that comes with over eating. There has been progress on combating America's obesity problem, with programs being put in place to help promote healthy eating and fitness. More and more restaurants are putting the amount of calories that are in the meals.  Also, many food companies such as Coca-Cola are promoting making healthy choices with their drinks and products, also putting the calories on them and making the nutrition facts readily available.

In contrast, gametes are cells that fuse during [[sexual reproduction]], [[germ cell]]s are cells that give rise to gametes, and [[stem cells]] are cells that can divide through [[mitosis]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into diverse specialized cell types. For example, in [[mammal]]s, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to [[spermatozoa]] and [[ovum|ova]] which fuse during [[fertilization]] to produce a cell called a [[zygote]], which divides and differentiates into the cells of an [[embryo]]. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body.&lt;ref name="campbell229"/&gt;

Theoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they never transmit to their descendants the mutations they have undergone. However, in [[sponge]]s, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in [[Cnidaria]], differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline.

The word "somatic" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sōma'', meaning "body".

==Evolution==
As [[multicellularity]] evolved many times, sterile somatic cells did too. The evolution of an immortal [[germline]] producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of [[Death#In biology|mortality]], and can be viewed in its simplest version in [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3098969 | pmid=21174128 | doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 | volume=24 | title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae | year=2011 | journal=Sex. Plant Reprod. | pages=97–112 | author=Hallmann A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germ line are called [[Weismann barrier|Weismannists]]. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., [[vertebrate]]s, [[arthropod]]s, ''[[Volvox]]''), as a great number of species have the capacity for [[somatic embryogenesis]] (e.g., [[land plant]]s, most [[algae]], many [[invertebrates]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 29-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niklas, K. J. (2014) [http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6.long The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and chromosome content==
Like all cells, somatic cells contain [[DNA]] arranged in [[chromosome]]s.  If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called [[diploid]] and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called [[haploid]].)  Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 [[chromosomes]] organized into 23 pairs.  By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a [[zygote]]. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).

However, a large number of [[species]] have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours ("[[tetraploid]]") or even sixes ("[[hexaploid]]"). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of [[wheat]], ''Triticum aestivum L.'', a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every [[chromatid]].

The frequency of spontaneous [[mutation]]s is significantly lower in advanced male [[germ cell]]s than in somatic cell types from the same individual.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=10015–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9707592 |pmc=21453 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.17.10015|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of [[DNA repair]] enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]].&lt;ref name="pmid23153565" /&gt;

==Cloning==
In recent years, the technique of [[cloning]] whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" and involves removing the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an [[ovum]] of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a [[diploid]] number of [[chromosomes]]). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the [[uterus]] of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any [[mitochondria]]l DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus.  In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as [[Dolly the Sheep]] and, more recently, [[Snuppy]], the first cloned [[dog]].
Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.

==Genetic Modifications==
Development of [[biotechnology]] has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 generates and corrects a metabolic disease|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44624|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Commits $190M to Somatic Gene-Editing Tools/Tech Research|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nih-commits-190m-to-somatic-gene-editing-toolstech-research/81255414|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some [[Human genetic engineering#Controversy|controversies]], although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Treat Gene Editing Differently In Two Types Of Human Cells?|url=http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-treat-gene-editing-differently-two-types-human-cells/|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18825">A '''system accident''' is an "unanticipated interaction of multiple failures" in a [[complex system]]. This complexity can be either technological or organizational, and is frequently both.&lt;ref name="perrow"&gt;Perrow, Charles (1984).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VC5hYoMw4N0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Charles+Perrow#PPA10,M1 ''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies, With a New Afterword and a Postscript on the Y2K Problem''], Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-00412-9}}, 1984, 1999 (first published by Basic Books 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  A system accident can be very easy to see in hindsight, but difficult to see in foresight because there are too many different action pathways to seriously consider all of them.

These accidents often resemble [[Rube Goldberg device]]s in the way that small errors of judgment, flaws in technology, and insignificant damages combine to form an [[emergence|emergent]] disaster. System accidents were described in 1984 by [[Charles Perrow]], who termed them "[[Normal Accidents|normal accidents]]", as having such characteristics as [[interactive complexity]], [[tight coupling]], [[cascading failures]], and [[opaqueness]].  [[James Reasoner|James T. Reason]] extended this approach with [[human reliability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Error|last= Reason| first= James|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1990-10-26|isbn= 0-521-31419-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Swiss Cheese Model|Swiss cheese model]], now widely accepted in [[aviation safety]] and healthcare.

Once an enterprise passes a certain point in size, with many employees, specialization, backup systems, double-checking, detailed manuals, and formal communication, employees can all too easily recourse to protocol, habit, and "being right."  Rather like attempting to watch a complicated movie in a language one is unfamiliar with, the narrative thread of what is going on can be lost.  And other phenomena such as [[groupthink]] can be occurring at the same time, for real world accidents almost always have multiple causes.  In particular, it is a mark of a dysfunctional organization to simply blame the last person who touched something.

Charles Perrow also termed system accidents as '''[[Normal Accidents|normal accident]]''', because given the current level of technology, the occasional such accident is highly likely in the long term.  In 2012 he wrote, "A normal accident is where everyone tries very hard to play safe, but unexpected interaction of two or more failures (because of interactive complexity), causes a cascade of failures (because of tight coupling)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Normal-Accidents-Living-with-High-Risk-Technologies.php '''GETTING TO CATASTROPHE''':  CONCENTRATIONS, COMPLEXITY AND COUPLING], Charles Perrow, ''The Montréal Review'', December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an aspect of an animal devouring its own tail, in that more formality and effort to get it exactly right can actually make the situation worse.&lt;ref name=LangewiescheOnValujet&gt;Langewiesche, William (March 1998).  [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/03/the-lessons-of-valujet-592/6534/4/ The Lessons of Valujet 592], ''The Atlantic''.  See especially the last three paragraphs of this long article:  “  .  .  .  Understanding why might keep us from making the system even more complex, and therefore perhaps more dangerous, too.”&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the more organizational rigmarole that is involved in adjusting to changing conditions, the more employees will delay reporting the changing conditions.  The more emphasis on formality, the less likely employees and managers will engage in real communication.  And new rules can make the situation worse, both by adding another layer of complexity and by telling employees, yet again, that they are not to think but merely to follow the rules.

In a 1999 article primarily focusing on health care, J. Daniel Beckham wrote, "It is ironic how often tightly coupled devices designed to provide safety are themselves the causes of disasters. Studies of the early warning systems set up to signal missile attacks on North America found that the failure of the safety devices themselves caused the most serious danger: false indicators of an attack that could have easily triggered a retaliation. Accidents at both Chernobyl and Three Mile Island were set off by failed safety systems."&lt;ref&gt;''The Crash of ValuJet 592: Implications for Health Care'', J. Daniel Beckham, January '99.

== Scott Sagan == 
[[Scott Sagan]] has multiple publications discussion the reliability of complex systems, especially regarding nuclear weapons.  ''The Limits of Safety'' (1993) provided an extensive review of close calls during the [[Cold War]] that could have resulted in a nuclear war by accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Scott D.|title=The Limits of Safety:  Organizations, Accidents, and Nuclear Weapons|date=1993|publisher=Princeton U.

{{Over-quotation|date=June 2011}}{{synthesis|date=June 2011}}
&lt;!-- Regarding the issue of whether or not this article contains unpublished synthesis of previously published material . . .
Charles Perrow directly states that both Apollo 13 and Three Mile Island were 'normal accidents' (this seems to be his preferred phrase, and I just don't remember how often he also uses the phrase 'system accident.'  William Langewiesch directly states that the crash of Valujet 592 was a system accident.
It's true that the excellent quote from the REPORT OF APOLLO 13 REVIEW BOARD ("Cortright Report") does not use the phase 'system accident,' but they come about as close as they can: "not the result of a chance malfunction in a statistical sense, but rather resulted from an unusual combination of mistakes, coupled with a somewhat deficient and unforgiving design."  And the phrase 'system accident' may not have been in use in 1970 when they issued their report within months of the near disaster.--&gt;

"It resembled other accidents in nuclear plants and in other high risk, complex and highly interdependent operator-machine systems; none of the accidents were caused by management or operator ineptness or by poor government regulation, though these characteristics existed and should have been expected.

That is, most written manuals are formalistic, but are neither helpful nor informative.

'''Brian Stimpson:'''

{{quote|Step 2. The unmarked cardboard boxes, stored for weeks on a parts rack, were taken over to SabreTech's shipping and receiving department and left on the floor in an area assigned to ValuJet property.

Step 3. Continental Airlines, a potential SabreTech customer, was planning an inspection of the facility, so a SabreTech shipping clerk was instructed to clean up the work place. He decided to send the oxygen generators to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta and labelled the boxes "aircraft parts". He had shipped ValuJet material to Atlanta before without formal approval. Furthermore, he misunderstood the green tags to indicate "unserviceable" or "out of service" and jumped to the conclusion that the generators were empty.

Step 4. The shipping clerk made up a load for the forward cargo hold of the five boxes plus two large main tires and a smaller nose tire. He instructed a co-worker to prepare a shipping ticket stating "oxygen canisters - empty". The co-worker wrote, "Oxy Canisters" followed by "Empty" in quotation marks. The tires were also listed.

Step 5. A day or two later the boxes were delivered to the ValuJet ramp agent for acceptance on Flight 592. The shipping ticket listing tires and oxygen canisters should have caught his attention but didn't. The canisters were then loaded against federal regulations, as ValuJet was not registered to transport hazardous materials. It is possible that, in the ramp agent's mind, the possibility of SabreTech workers sending him hazardous cargo was inconceivable&lt;ref&gt;Stimpson, Brian (Oct. 1998).

==Possible future applications of concept==

===Five-fold increase in airplane safety since 1980s, but flight systems sometimes switch to unexpected "modes" on their own===
In an article entitle "The Human Factor", William Langewiesche talks the 2009 crash of [[Air France Flight 447]] over the mid-Atlantic.  He points out that, since the 1980s when the transition to automated cockpit systems began, safety has improved fivefold.  Langwiesche writes, "In the privacy of the cockpit and beyond public view, pilots have been relegated to mundane roles as system managers."  He quotes engineer Earl Wiener who takes the humorous statement attributed to the Duchess of Windsor that one can never be too rich or too thin, and  adds "or too careful about what you put into a digital flight-guidance system."  Wiener says that the effect of automation is typically to reduce the workload when it is light, but to increase it when it's heavy.

Boeing Engineer Delmar Fadden said that once capacities are added to flight management systems, they become impossibly expensive to remove because of certification requirements.  But if unused, may in a sense lurk in the depths unseen.&lt;ref name=Langewiesche-2014&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash The Human Factor], ''Vanity Fair'', William Langewiesche, September 17, 2014.  "  .  .  .  pilots have been relegated to mundane roles as system managers,  .  .  .  Since the 1980s, when the shift began, the safety record has improved fivefold, to the current one fatal accident for every five million departures. No one can rationally advocate a return to the glamour of the past."&lt;/ref&gt;

Langewiesche cites industrial engineer Nadine Sarter who writes about "automation surprises," often related to system modes the pilot does not fully understand or that the system switches to on its own.  In fact, one of the more common questions asked in cockpits today is, "What’s it doing now?"  In response to this, Langewiesche again points to the fivefold increase in safety and writes, "No one can rationally advocate a return to the glamour of the past."&lt;ref name=Langewiesche-2014/&gt;

===Healthier interplay between theory and practice in which safety rules are sometimes changed?===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the article "A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems," by Nancy Leveson, in ''Safety Science'', April 2004:&lt;br&gt;"However, instructions and written procedures are almost never followed exactly as operators strive to become more efficient and productive and to deal with time pressures.  .  .  .  .  even in such highly constrained and high-risk environments as nuclear power plants, modification of instructions is repeatedly found and the violation of rules appears to be quite rational, given the actual workload and timing constraints under which the operators must do their job. In these situations, a basic conflict exists between error as seen as a deviation from the ''normative procedure'' and error as seen as a deviation from the rational and normally used ''effective procedure'' (Rasmussen and Pejtersen, 1994)."&lt;ref name=Nancy-Leveson-April-2004&gt;[http://sunnyday.mit.edu/accidents/safetyscience-single.pdf A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems], Nancy Leveson, ''Safety Science'', Vol. 42, No. 4, April 2004.  Paper based on research partially supported by National Science Foundation and NASA. "  .  .  In fact, a common way for workers to apply pressure to management without actually going out on strike is to 'work to rule,' which can lead to a breakdown in productivity and even chaos.  .  "&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps in the future, intelligently and slowly modifying safety rules based on actual experience becomes more common.

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[Mars suit]] design was utilized as a topic for technology education.&lt;ref name="nasa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/Designing_Spacesuits_Mars.html|title=Designing Spacesuits for Mars|website=NASA|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical education is entirely different from general education

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4835">[[image:OffsetTF.png|thumb|right|280px|The Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies]]

In [[astronomy]], the '''Tully–Fisher relation''' ('''TFR''') is an [[empirical relationship]] between the mass or intrinsic [[luminosity]] of a [[spiral galaxy]] and its [[galaxy rotation curve|asymptotic rotation velocity]] or [[emission line]] width. It was first published in 1977 by astronomers [[R. Brent Tully]] and [[J. Richard Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Tully, R. B. and Fisher, J. R., "A new method of determining distances to galaxies". [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1977A%26A....54..661T&amp;link_type=ARTICLE (pdf)] [[Astronomy and Astrophysics]], vol. 54, no. 3, Feb. 1977, pp.&amp;nbsp;661–673. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1977A%26A....54..661T (abs)]&lt;/ref&gt; The luminosity is calculated by multiplying the galaxy's [[apparent brightness]] by 4πd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where d is its distance from us, and the spectral-line width is measured using [[long-slit spectroscopy]].

Several different forms of the TFR exist, depending on which precise measures of mass, luminosity or rotation velocity one takes it to relate. Tully and Fisher used [[visible light|optical]] luminosity, but subsequent work showed the relation to be tighter when defined using microwave to infrared ([[K band (infrared)|K band]]) radiation (a good proxy for [[stellar mass]]), and even tighter when luminosity is replaced by the galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas).&lt;ref&gt;S. S. McGaugh, J. M. Schombert, G. D. Bothun,2 and W. J. G. de Blok (2000), "The Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0003001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter form of the relation is known as the '''Baryonic Tully–Fisher relation''' ('''BTFR'''), and states that baryonic mass is proportional to velocity to the power of roughly 3.5–4.&lt;ref&gt;S. Torres-Flores, B. Epinat, P. Amram, H. Plana, C. Mendes de Oliveira (2011), "GHASP: an Hα kinematic survey of spiral and irregular galaxies -- IX. The NIR, stellar and baryonic Tully–Fisher relations", {{arxiv|1106.0505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TFR can be used to estimate the distance to spiral galaxies by allowing the luminosity of a galaxy to be derived from its directly measurable line width. The distance can then be found by comparing the luminosity to the apparent brightness. Thus the TFR constitutes a rung of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], where it is calibrated using more direct distance measurement techniques and used in turn to calibrate methods extending to larger distance.

In the [[dark matter]] paradigm, a galaxy's rotation velocity (and hence line width) is primarily determined by the mass of the dark matter [[dark matter halo|halo]] in which it lives, making the TFR a manifestation of the connection between visible and dark matter mass. In [[MOND|Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)]], the BTFR (with power-law index exactly 4) is a direct consequence of the [[gravitational force| gravitational force law]] effective at low [[acceleration]].&lt;ref&gt;S. McGaugh (2011), "The Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation of Gas-Rich Galaxies as a Test of ΛCDM and MOND", ApJ, {{arxiv|1107.2934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analogues of the TFR for non-rotationally-supported galaxies, such as [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], are known as the [[Faber–Jackson relation]] and the [[Fundamental plane (elliptical galaxies)|fundamental plane]].

'''William Ernest Stephen Turner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FRS}} (22 September 1881 – 27 October 1963) was a British chemist and pioneer of scientific glass technology.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] accessed 15 July 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Turner was born in [[Wednesbury]], [[Staffordshire]] on 22 September 1881. He went to [[King Edward VI Five Ways|King Edward VI Grammar School]], Five Ways, [[Birmingham]], and achieved a BSc (1902) and MSc (1904) in chemistry at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

He married Mary Isobell Marshall (died 1939) and they had 4 children.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1904, he joined the [[University of Sheffield|University College of Sheffield]] as a lecturer, and, in 1915, established the Department of Glass Manufacture, becoming in 1916 the Department of Glass Technology. He remained as its head until his retirement in 1945.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1943, he married Helen Nairn Munro, an artist noted for her glass engraving, and a teacher of glass decoration at the [[Edinburgh College of Art]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; She was provided with a blue dress and shoes in glass fibre cloth (which was then an unusual industrial material). This has been selected as one of the items in the [[BBC]]'s [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]].&lt;ref name=bbc100&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/NolQSkbeRc-6HNQvhF1J_A  BBC A History of the World] Glass Fibre Wedding Dress&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he established a collection of historical and modern glass which became the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] from his extensive collection, and the wedding dress is on display there.&lt;ref name=bbc100/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.turnermuseum.group.shef.ac.uk/biography.html Turner Museum Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 27 October 1963.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Work==

===Publications===
From 1904 to 1914, he published 21 papers on physical chemistry, mainly on [[molecular weight]]s in solution. However, the bulk of his work from 1917 to 1954 was on the chemistry and technology of glass. Following his retirement, he produced an extensive series on the history of glass technology and on glass in [[archeology]]. Apart from this, in 1909, he wrote a series of articles in the [[Sheffield Daily Telegraph]] about the scientist in industry, in which cooperation with universities was urged.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

===Research===
His early career was strictly academic, largely dealing with the associations of molecules in the liquid state. However, as his articles in the local newspaper showed, he was interested in the application of science to practical industrial problems, and this became the main theme of his work. The beginning of the [[First World War]] cut off [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] supplies from [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], and Turner proposed that the University should help British industry. The work in metallurgy led to enquiries about glass, and in 1915 Turner produced a 'Report on the glass industry of Yorkshire', noting that this was largely unscientific and [[rule of thumb]] in nature. He thereby persuaded the University to set up a Department of Glass Manufacture in 1915 for research and teaching where he remained for the rest of his career, becoming internationally known. The main thrust of his research was on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the chemical composition and the working properties of glasses.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

In 1916, he founded the [[Society of Glass Technology]], becoming its first secretary. It published a Journal, which he edited until 1951. He was also involved in the formation of the [[International Commission on Glass]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

===Teaching===
Turner initially taught physical chemistry, and in 1905 started specific courses for metallurgists. This involvement led him to become President of the Sheffield Society of Applied Metallurgy in 1914. In 1915, the Department of Glass Manufacture began an outreach programme, providing short courses to industry in [[Mexborough]], [[Barnsley]], [[Castleford]] and [[Knottingley]] in addition to Saturday classes in Sheffield. These were extended to glass making centres in [[Derby]], [[Alloa]], [[Glasgow]] and [[London]]. From 1917, full-time day students entered for what became a Bachelor of Technical Science degree. During the [[Second World War]], Turner and other staff of the department provided technical lectures to industries such as those making glass electronic [[vacuum tubes]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

==Honours==
He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1919 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |supp=y |page=460|date= 8 January 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; for application of science to the glass industry, and in 1938 was appointed a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. He was the only person outside Germany to receive the [[Otto Schott]] Medal.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

'''Wee Wee Caye Marine Lab''' is located in the country of [[Belize]].

[[File:Wee wee caye.jpg|300px|thumb|Mode of transportation and view of surrounding dock area, March 2010]]

[[File:Wee wee caye 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Sustainable building practice that supports ecological health and proper filtration: Boardwalks prevent [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]], [[erosion]], and [[Ecosystem health|ecological damage]], all the while providing significant habitat to a variety of [[wildlife]]. Contrasts significantly to local islands, whose [[artificial beach]]es negatively impact natural [[reef]] ecosystems.]]

This biological lab, established in 1988, is located nine miles off the coast of southern Belize in the [[Stann Creek District]].  Wee Wee Caye, the island upon which this lab is situated, is host only to this biological station, which is managed in a sustainable fashion.  [[Mangrove]]s surround the entirety of the island, and provides not only erosion control to the island, but additionally provides habitat that supports a wide variety of [[fauna]].

Currently owned by two American citizens and [[researcher]]s, Paul and Mary Shave, this lab employs individuals from local communities in [[Dangriga]] when visitors are present.  The lab acts as a support facility to academic programs interested in marine, coastal, and tropical ecological studies.  Mode of transportation to and from the island include [[fiberglass]] boats operated by licensed guides.  Rustic [[Log cabin|cabin]]s provide housing to visitors, and meals are served three times a day and are prepared by local cooks.  [[Boardwalk]]s connect cabins within the mangrove forest in order to prevent compaction and damage to the surrounding environment.

Many local islands within the surrounding area have altered the natural mangrove forest that typically surrounds these islands with artificial sand beaches, so as to better serve the desires of foreign [[tourist]]s.  However, this "beach" system not only decreases the natural habitat of a variety of species, but it also infringes on the health of the [[coral reef]], covering many areas of the coral reef and causing death to local marine wildlife.  Erosion is also significantly enhanced through this artificial "beaching" practice, and run-off is very common.  Mangroves provide natural filtration, habitat, and prevent erosion into the surrounding [[marine environment]].  This biological lab seeks to encompass all of these sustainable practices in order to support wildlife in its natural system of order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1425">The '''Wine Institute''' and '''Vine Institute''' are two related organizations based in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], under the aegis of the country's [[Minister for Agriculture (Greece)|Ministry of Agriculture]]. They are devoted to researching [[Greek wine]] and to preserving and improving the country's winemaking.&lt;ref name=lazarakis&gt;{{cite book | author = Konstantinos Lazarakis | title = The Wines of Greece | year = 2005 | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company | isbn = 1-84000-897-0 | pages = 35–36, 40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wine Institute was founded in 1937, but was largely inactive until the 1960s, when it was involved in writing the first drafts of Greece's wine legislation. Since then, the Wine Institute has been primarily concerned with identifying and preserving indigenous [[List of grape varieties|grape varieties]] and [[yeast in winemaking|strains of yeast]], particularly rare ones. The Vine Institute has focused on studying the effects of different promising combinations of vines and [[terroir]], in order to provide a resource of information for Greek winemakers.&lt;ref name=lazarakis /&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol'']. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W. Caulkings in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arch.uiuc.edu/organizations/wia/timeline/bethunelouise.html "Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913)"], ''Women in Architecture (University of Illinois)''.

Another early practicing architect in the United States was [[Emily Williams (architect)|Emily Williams]] (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to [[San Francisco]] where she studied drafting at the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|California High School of Mechanical Arts]]. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[http://www.womenarchitectsca.com/sample-biographies/emily-williams/ Inge S.

Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodate Pope Riddle]] (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable pioneer of the early days was [[Josephine Wright Chapman]] (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of [[Tuckerman Hall]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuckermanhall.org/chapmanfull.pdf "Josephine Wright Chapman and Tuckerman Hall"], ''Tuckermanhall.org''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian architect [[Virginia Andreescu Haret]] (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in [[Italy]]. 
She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park. She often used Native American motifs (and artisans) while blending the regional [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style]] and [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Pueblo Revival Style]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=6694&amp;AT=1 A.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=3438 "Lönn, Wivi (1872 - 1966)"], ''Biografiakeskus''.

Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a "master builder" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the [[Mariehamn]] district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariehamn.ax/Kulturforvaltningen/Stadens_historia/Hilda_Hongell_ "Hilda Hongell"], ''Mariehamns stad''. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907.

She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''.

She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in [[Kentucky]] as well as a number of buildings in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html "Mary Rockwell Hook"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''.

[[Esther Hill|Esther Marjorie Hill]] was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.

==European developments==
After Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In [[Norway]], the first female architect was [[Lilla Hansen]] (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (''Den Kongelige Tegneskole'') in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lilla_Hansen/utdypning "Lilla Hansen"], ''Store Norske Leksikon''. {{no icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to run an architecture practice in [[Germany]] was [[Emilie Winkelmann]] (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the [[University of Hanover|College of Technology]] in [[Hanover]] (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war. One of her most notable buildings is the Tribüne theatre in [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], originally a girls school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/bezirk/winkelmann.html "Emilie Winkelmann, Architektin"], Lexikon: Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf von A bis Z, ''Berlin.de''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''.

* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings. And when doing competitions we used to take trips, like long train journeys, because we found that changing your environment affects your thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20080424/breaking-the-modernist-mold David Sokol, "Breaking the Modernist Mold: Raili Pietilä reflects on a life of design with her husband, Reima, and the new exhibition that examines the Pietilä legacy"], ''Metropolismag.com'', 24 April 2008.

She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[Serbia]], [[Ljiljana Bakić]] often worked with her husband Dragoljub Bakić. Their most important work was the design of the [[Aleksandar Nikolić Hall|Pionir Sports Hall]], for which they won the "Grand Prix of the Belgrade Architecture Salon" in 1974. Another [[Serbia]]n architect, [[Ivanka Raspopović]], partnered with fellow architect [[Ivan Antić]] to design  [[Belgrade]]'s "[[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade|Museum of Contemporary Art]]" and [[Kragujevac]]'s "[[Šumarice Memorial Park|21 October Museum]]" in the 1960's. Both buildings have since become national monuments.

==Progress since 2000==
Several women architects have had considerable success in recent years, gaining wide recognition for their achievements:

In 2004, the Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] became the first woman to be awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34337929 |title=Dame Zaha Hadid awarded the Riba Gold Medal for architecture - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= 2015-09-24|accessdate=2015-09-24|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her many projects, special mention was made of the [[Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Cincinnati]] and the [[BMW Central Building]] in Leipzig. When awarding the prize, the chairman of the jury, spoke of her "unswerving commitment to modernism" explaining how she had moved away from existing typology, from [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]], shifting the geometry of buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2004/announcement "Announcement: Zaha Hadid Becomes the First Woman to Receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

In 2010, another woman became a Pritzker Prize winner, [[Kazuyo Sejima]] from Japan, in partnership with [[Ryue Nishizawa]]. [[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Lord Palumbo]], the jury chairman, spoke of their architecture "that is simultaneously delicate and powerful, precise and fluid, ingenious but not overly or overtly clever; for the creation of buildings that successfully interact with their contexts and the activities they contain, creating a sense of fullness and experiential richness." Special consideration had been given to the Glass Center at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] in Ohio, and the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/announcement "Announcement: Architectural Partners in Japan Become the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

In 2007 [[Anna Heringer]] (born 1977, Germany) won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] for her [[METI Handmade School]] built with bamboo and other local materials in [[Rudrapur, Bangladesh|Rudrapur]], [[Bangladesh]]. An example of [[sustainable architecture]], the project was praised not only for its simple, humane approach and beauty but also for the level of cooperation achieved between architects, craftsmen, clients and users.&lt;ref name=akdn2007&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/Content/240Nine-projects-receive-2007-Aga-Khan-Award-for-Architecture "Nine projects receive 2007 Aga Khan Award for Architecture"], ''Aga Khan Development Network''.

Projects have included the [[Royal Danish Playhouse]] (2008) and [[Tietgenkollegiet]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/634/action/2/vis/996/ "Lene Tranberg"], ''KVINFO''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] was the first Indian [[Architect]] invited to serve on the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Design Innovation Council, where she created the Reciprocal Design Index as a design tool for Holistically Sustainable Development. She is the first woman in India to have established her in own firm.

==Women's influence==

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony in Helen Tierney (ed.), ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Vol. 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 104–108.

Routledge, 2003. pp. xiv–xv. {{ISBN|9780415284493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annmarie Adams]], Peta Tancred. ''Designing Women: Gender and the Architectural Profession'', University of Toronto Press, 2000,, pp. 3–5. {{ISBN|9780802082190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''. Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Australia 
A study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in [[Queensland]] to 18.2% in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
More recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'half-life' of women architects - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/the-half-life-of-women-architects/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|publisher = |last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|last2 = Clark|first2 = Justine|authorlink2 = Justine_Clark|date = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 1: at school - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-at-school/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 2: at work - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-2-at-work/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 3: Institute membership - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-3-institute-membership/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;South Africa
In 2016 only 21% of the architectural professionals registered in [[South Africa]] were women. A survey by the [[South African Institute of Architects|SA Institute of Architects]] Eastern Cape institute showed that in 2014 only 29% of architecture students graduating from [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Only 21% of SA architects are women - what can be done? |url =https://www.property24.com/articles/only-21-of-sa-architects-are-women-what-can-be-done/24574 |publisher = Property24 |accessdate = 2018-10-01 |date=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
In the United States, the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] reported in 2009 that 41% of architecture graduates were women while the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] National Associates Committee Report from 2004 gives the percentage of licensed female architects as 20%.
