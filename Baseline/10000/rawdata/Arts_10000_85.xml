The '''''Analects''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|論|語}}}}; [[Old Chinese]]: ''*run ŋ(r)aʔ''; {{zh|p=''lúnyǔ''|l=Edited Conversations}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:Appendix:Baxter-Sagart Old Chinese reconstruction]]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''Analects of Confucius''''', is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-[[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the ''Analects'' was considered merely a "commentary" on the [[Five Classics]], but the status of the ''Analects'' grew to be one of the central texts of [[Confucianism]] by the end of that dynasty. 

During the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the importance of the ''Analects'' as a [[philosophical|philosophy]] work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the "[[Four Books]]". The ''Analects'' has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and [[Eastern philosophy#East Asian philosophies|East Asian thought and values]] today.

Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'', and that the most basic step to cultivating ''ren'' was [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via [[Li (Confucian)|rituals and forms of propriety]], through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.

==History==

===Creation of the text===
[[File:Confucius 02.png|thumb|Portrait of Confucius, giving a lecture]]

According to [[Ban Gu]], writing in the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the ''Analects'' originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC.  The work is therefore titled ''Lunyu'' meaning "edited conversations" or "selected speeches" (i.e. analects).{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}}  This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the [[Song dynasty]] neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stated that ''Analects'' is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2013|p=26}} The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty [[philologist]] Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued  on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqb0Fa8Umv4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and the Analects : New Essays|author= Bryan W. Van Norden|page=13 |publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|isbn=9780195350821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Slingerland|2003|pp=xiii-xiv}} Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ID4gMCaLr0MC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and Confucianism: The Essentials|author=Lee Dian Rainey |page=10|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010 |isbn=9781444323603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf |title=The Analects of Confucius |author=Robert Eno  |year=2015 |work=Indiana University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no texts of the ''Analects'' have been discovered earlier, and because the ''Analects'' was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Els 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how early the text of the ''Analects'' existed, most ''Analects'' scholars believe that, by the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty.  A Han dynasty writer [[Wang Chong]] however claimed that the ''Analects'' that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|pp=25–26}}  A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the ''Analects'': 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, [[Mencius]], do not exist in the received text of the ''Analects''.&lt;ref&gt;Waley 23&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], there were two versions of the ''Analects'' that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the "[[Lu (state)|Lu]] version" and the "[[Qi (state)|Qi]] version". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516&gt;Gardner 7, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  In the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han]] (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the "[[Old Text]]" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden.&lt;ref name="E20"&gt;Els 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Huan Tan]], the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the ''Analects'' is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.&lt;ref name="W24"&gt;Waley 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a century later, the tutor of the ''Analects'' to [[Emperor Cheng of Han]], [[:zh:张禹 (西汉)|Zhang Yu]] (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the ''Analects'' known as the "Zhang Hou Lun". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the ''Analects'' today.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The Qi version was lost for about 1800&amp;nbsp;years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of [[Marquis of Haihun]] that was found 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |title=Qi version of 'Analects of Confucius' discovered in Haihunhou tomb |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=The Institute of Archaeology |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174212/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |archivedate=16 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the ''Analects'' exist today,&lt;ref name="E20" /&gt; though fragments of the old text version were discovered at [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang]].&lt;ref name="W24" /&gt;

Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the ''Analects'' known to scholars was found in the "Stone Classics of the Xinping Era", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of [[Luoyang]] around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the ''Analects'' that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the "[[Dingzhou]] ''Analects''", and the "[[Pyongyang]] ''Analects''", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang ''Analects'' was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang ''Analects'' has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Els 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|an earthquake]] shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the ''Analects''. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou ''Analects'' is shorter than the received ''Analects'', implying that the text of the ''Analects'' was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou ''Analects'' was entombed. There was evidence that "additions" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the ''Analects'' and included "extra" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang ''Analects'' is similar to the Dingzhou ''Analects''; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the [[North Korea]]n government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou ''Analects'' or the Pyongyang ''Analects'' represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Els 6, 10–11, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance within Confucianism===
During most of the Han period the ''Analects'' was not considered one of the principal texts of [[Confucianism]]. During the reign of [[Han Wudi]] (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the [[Five Classics]] were considered by the government to be canonical (''jing''). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The ''Analects'' was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral "commentary" (''zhuan'') on the Five Classics.&lt;ref name="G7"&gt;Gardner 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] the ''Analects'' was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the ''Analects''. The growing importance of the ''Analects'' was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the "Seven Classics": the Five Classics plus the ''Analects'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the [[Four Books]] by [[Zhu Xi]] and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
[[File:Commentaries of the Analects of Confucius.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of He Yan's commentary on the ''Analects'', with a sub-commentary by [[Xing Bing]], printed during the [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Since the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the ''Analects'' by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the ''Analects'' since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the ''Collected Explanations of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jijie'') by [[He Yan]] (c.&amp;nbsp;195–249) and several colleagues, and the ''Collected Commentaries of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jizhu'') by [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the ''Analects'' which had been produced by earlier Han and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]] (220–265&amp;nbsp;AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the ''Lunyu'' was guided by his belief that [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that "Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage" (sic). The ''Explanations'' was written in 248&amp;nbsp;AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the ''Analects'' for nearly 1,000 years, until the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the ''Analects'' that still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

He Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single "correct" intellectual orthodoxy that would "save" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 18–20, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the ''Analects'' by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the ''Analects'', demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, "[T]he ''Analects'' and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' are the most important works for students pursuing the [[Tao|Way]] [...] The words of the ''Analects'' are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature." From the first publication of the ''Commentaries'', Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the [[Ming dynasty|Chinese government]] endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the ''Analects'' by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 7–8, 21, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', but, because the ''Shiji'' contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the ''Analects'' makes the ''Analects'' arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;Lau ix&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius viewed himself as a "transmitter" of  social and political traditions originating in the early [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (''Analects'' 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Riegel "2. Confucius' Social Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
Confucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (''Analects'' 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while "ghosts" and "spirits" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of [[Ren (Confucianism)|''ren'']] by every individual in a community.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Later Confucian philosophers explained ''ren'' as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words "humane", "altruistic", or "benevolent", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses ''ren'' in the ''Analects'', very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term ''ren'' to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term ''ren'' is peculiar to the ''Analects''.)&lt;ref&gt;Waley 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the ''Analects'', Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define ''ren'' and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with ''ren'' and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of ''ren'' would speak carefully and modestly (''Analects'' 12.3); be resolute and firm (''Analects'' 12.20), courageous (''Analects'' 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (''Analects'' 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (''Analects'' 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (''Analects'' 17.6); and love others (''Analects'' 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of ''ren'', but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (''Analects'' 7.23).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

To Confucius, the cultivation of ''ren'' involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (''Analects'' 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated ''ren'' could be distinguished by their being "simple in manner and slow of speech." He believed that people could cultivate their sense of ''ren'' through exercising the inverted [[Golden Rule]]: "Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself"; "a man with ''ren'', desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed" (''Analects'' 12.2; 6.28).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (''Analects'' 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24).&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 34&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius regarded the exercise of [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate ''ren''. (''Analects'' 1.2).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

Confucius believed that ''ren'' could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']]: rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (''Analects'' 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of ''li'' should inform everything that one says and does (''Analects'' 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to ''li'' did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of ''li'' was the basis of a well-ordered society (''Analects'' 2.3).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of ''li'' was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] these "five relationships" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.

''Ren'' and ''li'' have a special relationship in the ''Analects'': ''li'' manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while ''ren'' is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of ''ren'' and ''li'' meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: "You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion" (''Analects'' 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (''Analects'' 15.8).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

===Political philosophy===
Confucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord" (''Analects'' 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalistic]] political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;Riegel "3. Confucius' Political Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: "Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son" (''Analects'' 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the [[rectification of names]], and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (''Analects'' 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (''Analects'' 12.19).&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ("virtue"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (''Analects'' 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of ''de'' is through a devotion to the correct practices of ''li''. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's ''de'' include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

===Education===
The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the ''Analects''. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity '''(''Analects'' 7.22)'''. Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection '''(''Analects'' 2.15)'''. When teaching he is never cited in the ''Analects'' as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through [[Socratic method|asking direct questions]], citing passages from the classics, and using analogies '''(''Analects'' 7.8)'''.&lt;ref name="Riegel4"&gt;Riegel 4 "Confucius and Education"&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. '''(''Analects'' 3.8)'''&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things '''(''Analects'' 12.11; see also 13.3)'''. He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn '''(''Analects'' 7.7; 15.38)'''. He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught [[Six Arts|practical skills]], but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.&lt;ref name="Riegel4" /&gt;

===Chapters===
In China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three [[incipit]]s. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the ''Analects'' are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.

Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. [[Voltaire]] and [[Ezra Pound]] believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. [[Simon Leys]], who recently translated the ''Analects'' into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. [[Elias Canetti]] wrote: "Confucius's ''Analects'' is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important."&lt;ref&gt;Canetti 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ''ziyue'', "The Master said," but without  punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows ''ziyue'' is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as "the Master said that.." and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation'' 2010 p. 285 "A large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ziyue 子曰, "The Master said," but because there are no punctuation marks in classical Chinese, we must ask if whatever follows ziyue is a literal transcription of speech, or a paraphrase of it, or a method of transmitting ideas in a written language which existed in important ways independently of the spoken language."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''art of Newfoundland and Labrador''' has followed a unique artistic trajectory when compared to mainland Canada, due to the geographic seclusion and socio-economic history of the province. Labradorian art possesses its own historical lineage.

While the history of craft and folk art in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is extensive, fine arts practices have developed primarily since 1949, when the province joined Canada. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the majority of fine art was created by visiting and itinerant artists. Newfoundland and Labradorian art developed significantly after joining Canada, with the introduction of government initiatives.  Since the 1960s in particular, waves of artists have established practices on the island, many with strong roots in the province. Others have been introduced by professional opportunities, residency programs, art education programs, and galleries. An established community of artists is now widely recognized, and creates work in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Labrador ==

[[File:Ours nageant (Musée du quai Branly) (3034045389).jpg|thumb|Artifact from Dorset Culture (Collection: Musée du quai Branly)|left]] Labradorian art has its roots in both the aboriginal cultures and the European contact period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The earliest examples of art in the province were produced by aboriginal peoples, with the oldest known object identified with the [[Dorset Culture]], created around 800 A.D.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|title=Visual Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two centuries of European trader and missionary contact with the Inuit, Innu and Settlers of Labrador, there was minor trade in available carvings and crafts. Moravian missionaries arrived in northern Labrador in the 1700s, and [[Wilfred Grenfell|Grenfell]]'s medical mission traveled in the 1800s to southern Labrador and northern Newfoundland. Mission workers helped create a local handicraft industry that allowed residents to sell hooked mats, knitted goods and other items at North American retail shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/grenfell-mission.php|title=Grenfell Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, early Grenfell rugs are considered works of art, and many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s are held in museum collections throughout North America.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labradorvirtualmuseum.ca/home/contemporary_art.htm|title=Contemporary Art : Labrador Virtual Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, contemporary visual arts began to flourish. This trend was bolstered by government initiatives, the introduction of technologies and transportation, and a shift in attitude toward northern and aboriginal art as cultural and artistic collector items. In Labrador, this began with a Provincial Government rural development initiative called [[Labrador Craft Producers Association]] (LCPA), which was headed by [[Garfield Warren]]. [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was also visited around this time by visual artist [[Bill Ritchie (Canadian artist)|Bill Ritchie]], who encouraged sculpture and printmaking among Labrador's Inuit artists and initiated a collective for the development and sale of visual arts by artists like [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]] and [[John Terriak]]. The [[Labrador Inuit Association]] continued Ritchie's work for approximately a decade, with marketing and promotion of north coast Inuit art. Arts and crafts as an industry were developed by the LCPA throughout the rest of Labrador until the initiative dismantled in 1993. Prior to its demise, the LCPA mounted a major exhibition and video project entitled "Visions of Labrador," which took place in 1991.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

The Labrador Arts and Culture Centre opened in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285|title=Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada – Official Tourism Website|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804165348/http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285#|archive-date=2016-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aided the growth of visual arts in western Labrador. Individual artists and artists' collectives in the Straits, [[Lake Melville]] and [[Labrador West]] began to develop, market and promote themselves in the visual arts. Labrador Handicrafts Inc. and The Birches Gallery stepped in to fill the void left by government and aboriginal associations. In [[Happy Valley – Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], The Birches Gallery mounted a series of exhibitions and promotional events, in Labrador and several sites throughout North America, from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt; This, combined with a new initiative in Labrador of the St. John's-based [[Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Council]]'s Labrador Craft Marketing Agency in 1996, provided new impetus for a strong arts and crafts industry. A Visual Arts Association has continued in Western Labrador for more than 20 years, headed by artists such as [[Joyce Channing]], [[Sheilagh Harvey]], [[Margorie O'Brien]], and [[Ed Owen (Canadian artist)|Ed Owen]].&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

Today, a strong community of visual arts and artists work in Labrador, basing their work in a variety of media. Notable Labradorian artists include [[Boyd Chubbs]], [[Robin Smith Peck]], [[Mike Massie]], [[Billy Gauthier]], [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]], [[John Terriak]], [[William Lucy]], George Flowers, [[Derrick Pottle]], [[George Collins (artist)|George Collins]], [[David Terriak]], [[Georgina Broomfield]], [[Emily Flowers]], [[John Neville (artist)|John Neville]], [[Madeline Michelin]], [[Barry Pardy]], [[Garmel Rich]], and [[Shannon Simms]].

In 2016, the first exhibition of art by Labrador Inuit was held at [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery. Titled "SakKijâjuk: Inuit Fine Art and Craft from Nunatsiavut," the exhibition described the history of post-Confederation artistic production in Nunatsiavut.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakkijajuk.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Newfoundland ==

=== Beothuk art ===

[[File:"Sketch IX" by Shawnadithit.gif|thumb|"Emblems of Red Indian Mythology" (sketch IX) by Shawnadithit|left]]
[[Beothuk]] were the indigenous inhabitants of Newfoundland from AD 1500 onward, now believed to be largely extinct due to a contraction in their territories following contact with Europeans. Little documentation exists about their cultural practices. Many Beothuk artifacts were discovered in grave sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and include carved bone, antler and ivory pendants intricately decorated with incised patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-culture.php|title=Beothuk Culture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable feature of [[Beothuk culture]] was the use of powdered [[hematite]], or [[red ochre]], which they used to paint their canoes and other artifacts, and their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beothuk/|title=Beothuk|first=James A.|last=Tuck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, ten drawings were obtained by Mr W. E. Cormack during the winter of 1829 from the last known full-blooded Beothuk, [[Shanawdithit]], while she resided in his St. John's house. They present articles of food, utensils, implements and emblems used by the Beothuk, as well as scenes enacted on or near the [[Exploits River]] and [[Red Indian Lake]] between the years 1810 and 1823. "Although rude and truly Indian in character," James P. Howley wrote in 1915 (judging them by European aesthetic standards),"they nevertheless display no small amount of artistic skill, and there is an extraordinary minuteness of topographical detail in those having reference to the Exploits River and adjacent country. These latter bear a striking resemblance to Micmac sketches of a similar character, such as I have frequently seen and made use of, when accompanied by Micmac canoemen on the Geological Survey of the Island. There is one notable omission in either, i.e., the entire absence of anything like a regular scale. As a rule, rivers and lakes are greatly exaggerated, and particular features, which may in nature be situated widely apart, are frequently crowded into a very small space; the reverse being just as frequently the case."&lt;ref&gt;James P. Howley, F.G.S., "Drawings by Shanawdithit", THE BEOTHUCKS OR RED INDIANS: THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF NEWFOUNDLAND, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915, Memorial University of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Confederation: "Outsiders and Amateurs" ===
[[File:Maurice Cullen. "A Misty Afternoon, St. John's, Newfoundland." (1910), oil on canvas. 122.5 cm x 153.25.

Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting and itinerant artists. The first known image of the Newfoundland landscape is alleged to have been produced by the itinerant artist [[Gerard Edema]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Russell Harper, Painting in Canada: A History, 2nd ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; known for "painting landscapes, in which he exhibited a variety of scenes of horror, such as rocks, mountains, precipices, cataracts, and other marks of savage nature."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole. Anecdotes of Painting in England. (London: Alexander Murray, 1871), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Topographic drawings and watercolours by naval and military officers were the prevalent art form until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[William Eagar]] attempted to teach picturesque painting while in Newfoundland, but his efforts to promote the "new" branch of art were met with very little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra E. Carter, William H. Eagar: "Sensibilities of No Common Order" Masters thesis (Concordia University Fine Arts Department, 1979), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the artist [[J.W. Nichols]] composed an instructional article for the public in the Newfoundland Quarterly on "Recreative Art," which provided guidelines for amateurs wishing to explore Nature by painting its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Nichols, "Recreative Art," The Newfoundland Quarterly, vol 2, 1902-1903, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland-born artists such as [[Maurice Galbraith Cullen|Maurice Cullen]] and [[Robert Pilot]] traveled to Europe to study art with prominent ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century brought visiting artists such as [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Eliot O'Hara]] to Newfoundland. Members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] came to the island on numerous occasions, drawn to its rocky landscape and northern topography. [[A.Y. Jackson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[Lawren Harris]] created a number of works during their visits, primarily landscape and rural scenes. [[F.H. Varley]] would provide woodcut landscape illustrations for the first commercial release of Newfoundland poet [[E. J. Pratt]], titled "Newfoundland Verse" (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Northrup Frye, Preface to The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination (Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 1971), p. i-iv&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists in the 1930s include [[Rhoda Dawson]], who arrived in 1930 to be a design instructor with the Grenfell mission until 1933, returning in 1934 from England to teach at [[Payne's Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neary, Explanatory material for Rhoda Dawson's "The Wharves of St. John's Newfoundland," Canadian Parliamentary Review, Summer, 1992, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[George Campbell Tinning]] visited Newfoundland as a war artist during the Second World War, returning to paint in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000723&amp;sl=7678&amp;pos=1|title=Campbell Tinning - The Newfoundland Paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local amateur art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly [[The Art Students Club]], which opened in 1940. Organized by Muriel (Mrs. A.C.) Hunter, with Harold Goodridge as President, the club grew to 40 active members and 100 associates over 10 years, and featured work of artists from overseas and from Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;"Without a Suitable Gallery, Club Tries to Encourage Nfld. Art," The Daily News, (June 23, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; With no official gallery space, exhibitions were held in various locations. Although none were formally trained, notable artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward; Agnes Marian Ayre; and [[Harold B. Goodridge]] (who worked on a number of mural commissions, including one for the lobby of the [[Confederation Building (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Confederation Building]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]).&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1949, [[Robert Ayre]], then editor of [[Canadian Art]], described Newfoundland's artistic environment as one left largely to "outsiders and amateurs" due to its geographic isolation and small population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ayre, "Art" in W. Stewart Wallace, The Encyclopedia of Canada. Newfoundland and Supplement, vol. 104 (Toronto: University Associates of Canada, 1949) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Confederation: A Cultural Renaissance ===

After [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists who had studied abroad. Among the first were [[Rae Perlin]], who studied at the [[Art Students League]] in New York, and [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]] and [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], who both graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; The Shepherds would establish the province's first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art, in a house in downtown [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|title=Reginald Shepherd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Memorial University Extension Services]] and [[St. Michael's Printshop]] in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibbs Hole (now [[Hibb's Cove]]), established by painter [[George Noseworthy]], brought professional artists such as [[Anne Meredith Barry]] to the province.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a significant increase in artists based on the island of Newfoundland. Painter [[Christopher Pratt]] returned to the province in 1961 with his wife [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] to work at the newly established [[Memorial University Art Gallery]] as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. Wesleyville's [[David Blackwood]] graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]] in the early 1960s and has achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history, though he no longer resides in the province. Newfoundland-born artist [[Gerald Squires]] returned in 1969.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; Other notable artists who developed their practices during this period include [[Marlene Creates]], [[Diana Dabinett]], [[Kathleen Knowling]], [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Heidi Oberheide]], [[Manfred Buchheit]], [[Stewart Montgomerie]], [[Jean Claude Roy]] and [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1975, Peter Bell, who was an art critic in addition to being an artist and gallery administrator, wrote: "There has never been anything remotely resembling an art movement in Newfoundland. There have been successive societies and associations of persons interested in painting, but there has been no group with a coherent style or philosophy, nor has there been any developmental succession from one artist to another. Artists in Newfoundland have been, and still are, isolated phenomena. Distinguished, certainly, but independent and unique."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bell.

[[File:L'Anse aux Meadows, The Meeting of Two Worlds.jpg|thumb|Luben Boykov. "The Meeting of Two Worlds" at L'Anse aux Meadows|left]] 
From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as art galleries such as the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which later became [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery), the [[Grenfell Art Gallery]], the [[Resource Centre for the Arts]], and [[Eastern Edge]] were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]], the Western Community College (now [[College of the North Atlantic]]) in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], and the [[Anna Templeton Centre]] in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial art galleries such as Bonnie Leyton Gallery of Fine Art, Christina Parker Gallery, Emma Butler Gallery and Red Ochre Gallery, support the work of Newfoundland and Labradorian artists.

In the 1990s, Bulgarian artists came to this province through [[Gander Airport]] as part of a decade-long influx of refugees from the Soviet Block. Notably, [[Luben Boykov]], [[Elena Popova]], [[Vessela Brakalova]] and [[Veselina Tomova]] arrived in 1990. Ellie Yonova would arrive in 1999. Since then, each artist has contributed to the local creative landscape through their personal practices, exhibit design, publications, and public sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubenboykov.com/about/index.html|title=about|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visavisgraphics.com/about.html|title=vis-à-vis graphics - about us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/notes-from-newfoundland/|title=Notes from Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Federal Government announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to assist the City of St. John's to redevelop the Tucker Premises in historic [[Quidi Vidi]] village. The [[Quidi Vidi Plantation]] was opened in 2012 as a "Craft Incubator," with 10 purpose-built studio spaces for local, emerging artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/media-release/grand-opening-held-quidi-vidi-village-plantation|title=Grand Opening Held For Quidi Vidi Village Plantation - City Of St. John's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sound Symposium]] was started in St John's, Nfld, in 1983. Symposia followed in 1984 and now take place every two years. The event brings together a range of local, national, and international artists working in sound, film, theatre, and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundsymposium.com/about/|title=About - SOUND SYMPOSIUM - CELEBRATING NEW MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE ARTS SINCE 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newfoundland and Labrador's arts community is now recognized nationally and internationally. [[Fogo Island Arts]], launched in 2008 on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland|Fogo Island]], supports a residency-based contemporary art program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fogoislandarts.ca/about/fogo-island-arts/|title=About - Fogo Island Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2015, the province was represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] as Official Collateral Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/news/newfoundland-officially-accepted-venice-biennale/|title=Newfoundland Accepted by Venice Biennale - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Philippa Jones]] became the first Newfoundland and Labrador artist to be included in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] contemporary art biennial after it was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/videos/shine-a-light-canadian-biennial-2014-philippa-jones|title=Shine a Light: Canadian Biennial 2014, Philippa Jones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured," wrote author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] in 2016, "All cultures are in constant flux, of course. But Newfoundland, hyper-aware of being a distinct society, is at the same time riven with a kind of archival anxiety to hold fast to defining myths; the stories we tell to bring ourselves into existence. This anxiety might be a symptom caused by existing on the periphery, subject to constant swings in economic instability and geographical isolation in a sublime but rugged beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/what-is-the-new-newfoundland-dream/|title=What Is the New Newfoundland Dream? - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, a study recorded approximately 1,200 artists in Newfoundland and Labrador, representing 0.47% of the province's labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillstrategies.com/content/artists-and-cultural-workers-canada%E2%80%99s-provinces-and-territories|title=Artists and Cultural Workers in Canada's Provinces and Territories - Hill Strategies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery ===

[[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador is the major public gallery in the province. The gallery exhibits original visual art, conducts research, educates about art, and is responsible for permanent art collections held in trust for the public. The Rooms provides 10,000 square feet of gallery space for temporary exhibits, normally balanced between exhibitions produced by the gallery and those borrowed from elsewhere. Exhibitions are toured to satellite galleries throughout the province: [[Mary March Provincial Museum]] in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]], the [[Provincial Seamen's Museum]] in [[Grand Bank]];  and the [[Labrador Interpretation Centre]] in [[North West River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/exhibits/regional-museums|title=Regional Museums - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Rooms, St John's NL.JPG|thumb|The Rooms, St John's NL]] The gallery manages several collections, known together as the "Permanent Collections": Memorial University of Newfoundland; the J. K. Pratt Memorial Collection; The Rooms Collection; and the Art Procurement Collection of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (Provincial Art Bank). Altogether, they comprise over 7,000 works of art, primarily post-1960 Canadian art. Emphasis is placed on art from Newfoundland and Labrador, with major holdings of such artists as [[Christopher Pratt]], [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]], [[Gerald Squires]], [[David Blackwood]], [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]], [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Anne Meredith Barry]], [[Marlene Creates]], [[Helen Gregory]], [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]], [[Ned Pratt]], and many others.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/rooms-provincial-art-gallery.php|title=The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/about-us|title=About Us - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery began in the university library in 1961. Moving to the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre in 1968, the gallery took on a more active provincial role by organizing regular touring exhibitions to other arts and culture centres. Memorial's Art Gallery became the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1994, and then The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery in 2004. Over the years, its administrators have included [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Edythe Goodridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/curator-edythe-goodridge-was-called-mother-of-newfoundland/article19482353/|title=Art curator Edythe Goodridge was called 'mother' of Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Grattan]], [[Gordon Laurin]], [[Shauna McCabe]], [[Megan Williams (artist)|Megan Williams]], and [[Sheila Perry]].

'''Arthur Szyk''' (Polish: [ˈartur ʃɪk], June 16, 1894 &amp;ndash; September 13, 1951) was a Polish-Jewish artist who worked primarily as a [[book illustration|book illustrator]] and political artist throughout his career. Arthur Szyk was born into a prosperous middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Łódź]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00178831?rskey=6Ngkwk&amp;result=1 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. Arthur Szyk: Artist, Jew, Pole. Oxford: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; in the part of Poland which was under Russian rule in the 19th century. An acculturated Polish Jew, Szyk always proudly regarded himself both as a Pole and a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921, he lived and created his works mainly in France and Poland, and in 1937 he moved to the United Kingdom. In 1940, he settled permanently in the United States, where he was granted American citizenship in 1948.

Arthur Szyk became a renowned artist and book illustrator as early as the interwar period. His works were exhibited and published not only in Poland, but also in France, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. However, he gained broad popularity in the United States primarily through his political caricatures, in which, after the outbreak of World War II, he savaged the policies and personalities of the leaders of the [[Axis powers]]. After the war, he also devoted himself to political issues, especially the support of the creation of the state of [[Israel]].

Szyk's work is characterized in its material content by social and political commitment, and in its formal aspect by its rejection of [[modernism]] and embrace of the traditions of [[medieval art|medieval]] and [[renaissance art|renaissance painting]], especially [[illuminated manuscript]]s from those periods. Unlike most caricaturists, Szyk always showed great attention to the colouristic effects and details in his works.

Today, Szyk is an increasingly well-known and often exhibited artist only in his last home country, the United States. However, exhibitions in Poland and Germany are familiarizing Europe with one of the most prolific artists of World War II.

== Background and youth ==
Arthur Szyk,&lt;ref&gt;The artist's birth name was Artur Szyk, but in Western Europe and the United States he is commonly known as Arthur Szyk, which is also how he usually signed his works.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Solomon Szyk and his wife Eugenia, was born in Łódź, in Russian-occupied Poland, on June 16, 1894. Solomon Szyk was a textile factory director, a quiet occupation until June 1905, when, during the so-called [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|Łódź insurrection]], one of his workers threw acid in his face, permanently blinding him.

[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Portrait of Julia Szyk (1926), Paris.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Julia Szyk. Paris, 1926.]]

Szyk showed artistic talent as a child; when he was six years old, he reportedly drew sketches of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Current Biography]]'', New York, 1946, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his family was culturally assimilated and did not practice [[Orthodox Judaism]], Arthur also liked drawing biblical scenes from the [[Hebrew Bible]]. These interests and talents prompted his father, upon the advice of Szyk's teachers, to send Szyk to Paris to study at [[Académie Julian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/about-szyk/early-years.htm?mnHd=2&amp;mnSubHd=12 szyk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a studio school popular among French and foreign students. In Paris, Szyk was exposed to all modern trends in art; however, he decided to follow his own way, which hewed closely to tradition. He was especially attracted by the medieval art of illuminating manuscripts, which greatly influenced his later works. When studying in Paris, Szyk remained closely involved with the social and civic life of Łódź. During the years 1912–1914 the teenage artist produced numerous drawings and caricatures on contemporary political themes that were published in the Łódź satirical magazine ''Śmiech'' ("Laughter").

After four years in France, Szyk returned to Poland in 1913 and continued his studies in [[Teodor Axentowicz]]'s class at [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]], which was under Austrian rule at that time. He not only attended lectures and classes, but he also actively participated in Kraków's cultural life. He did not forget his home city Łódź – he designed the stage sets and costumes for the Łódź-based Bi Ba Bo cabaret. The political and national engagement of the artist also deepened during that time – Szyk regarded himself as a Polish patriot but he was also proud of being Jewish and he often opposed [[antisemitism]] in his works. At the beginning of 1914, Szyk in a group with other Polish-Jewish artists and writers set off on a journey to Palestine, organized by the Jewish Cultural Society Hazamir ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: nightingale). There he observed the efforts of Jewish settlers working for the benefit of the future Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Ungar : ''Arthur Szyk : Soldier in Art'', in: ''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The visit was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Szyk, who was a Russian subject, had to leave Palestine, which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at that time, and go back to his home country in August 1914. He was conscripted into the Russian army and fought at the [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|battle of Łódź]] in November/December 1914, but at the beginning of 1915 he managed to escape from the army and spent the rest of the war in his home city. He also used the time spent in the Russian army to draw Russian soldiers and published these drawings as postcards in the same year (1915).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 1916, Arthur Szyk married Julia Likerman. Their son George was born in the following year, and their daughter Alexandra in 1922.

== Between the wars ==

=== In reborn Poland ===
[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), Valkyrie (1919), Łódź, Poland.jpg|thumb|In this image from the 1919 book Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), a [[Valkyrie]]-like figure stands on a globe stamped with the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz).]]
After Poland had regained independence in 1918, Szyk fully developed his artistic activity, combining it with political engagement. In 1919, influenced by the events of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], he published, together with poet [[Julian Tuwim]], his first book of political illustrations: ''Rewolucja w Niemczech'' (''Revolution in Germany''), which was a satire on the Germans, who need the [[Kaiser]]'s and the military's consent even to start a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Szyk had to take part in warfare again – during the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1920), in which he served as a [[Polish cavalry]] officer and as the artistic director of the [[propaganda]] department of the Polish army in Łódź.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In France ===
In 1921 Arthur Szyk and his family moved to Paris where they stayed until 1933. The relocation to Paris is marked by a breakthrough in the formal aspect of Szyk's works. While Szyk's prior book illustrations were drawings in pen and ink (Szyk had illustrated six books before 1925, including three published in the [[Yiddish language]]), the illustrations for the books published in Paris were full colour and full of detail. The first book illustrated in this way was the ''[[Book of Esther]]'' (''Le livre d'Esther'', 1925), followed by [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s dialogue ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (''La tentation de Saint Antoine'', 1926), [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoît]]'s novel ''Jacob's Well'' (Le puits de Jacob, 1927) and other books. Those illustrations, which are characterized by a rich diversity of colours and detailed presentation, deliberately referred to the medieval and renaissance traditions of illumination of manuscripts, often with interspersed contemporary elements. Szyk drew himself as one of the characters in the Book of Esther.. The only stylistic exception is illustrations to the two volume collection of humorous [[anecdote]]s about Jews ''Le juif qui rit'' (1926/27), in which the artist returned to simple black and white graphics. (Paradoxically, the book, one of the best known of his works, met with criticism as repeating antisemitic stereotypes.) The artist's reputation was also enhanced by exhibitions which were organized by Galeries Auguste Decour (the art gallery first exhibited Szyk's works in 1922). Szyk's drawings were purchased by the Minister of Education and Fine Arts [[Anatole de Monzie]] and the New York businessman Harry Glemby.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk had many opportunities to travel for his art. In 1922, he spent seven weeks in [[Morocco]], then a [[French protectorate of Morocco|protectorate of France]], where he drew the portrait of the [[pasha]] of [[Marrakech]] – as a goodwill ambassador he received the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] from the French government for this work. In 1931 he was invited to the seat of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], where he began illustrating the statute of the League. The artist made some of the pages of the statute but did not complete that work as a result of his disappointment with the policies of the organization in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Statute of Kalisz'' and ''Washington and his Times'' ===
During his stay in France, Szyk maintained his ties with Poland. He often visited his home country, illustrated books, and exhibited his works there. During the second half of the 1920s, he mainly illustrated the ''[[Statute of Kalisz]]'', a charter of liberties which were granted to the Jews by [[Bolesław the Pious]], the Duke of [[Kalisz]], in 1264.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. "Art against Prejudice: Arthur Szyk's Statute of Kalisz." The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts 14 (1989): 47-63. doi:10.2307/1504027.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1926–1928, he created a rich graphic setting of the 45-page-long Statute, showing the contribution of the Jews to Polish society; for example their participation in Poland's pro-independence struggle, during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, and in the [[Polish Legions in World War I]] commanded by [[Józef Piłsudski]], to whom Szyk also dedicated his work. ''The Statute of Kalisz'' was published in book form in [[Munich]] in 1932, but it gained popularity even earlier. Postcards with reproductions of Szyk's illustrations were published in Kraków around 1927. The original art was shown at exhibitions in [[Warsaw]], Łódź and Kalisz in 1929, and a "Traveling Exhibition of Artur Szyk's Works" was held in 1932–1933, displaying the Statute at exhibitions in 14 Polish towns and cities. In recognition for his work, Arthur Szyk was decorated with the Gold [[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Cross of Merit]] by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original paintings for the Statute are now in the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another great historical series Szyk created was ''Washington and his Times'', which he began in Paris in 1930. The series, which included 38 [[watercolor painting|watercolours]], depicted the events of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a tribute to the first president of the United States and the American nation in general. The series was presented at an exhibition at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. in 1934. It brought another decoration to Szyk – this time the George Washington Bicentennial Medal from the American government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington and his Times'' was published in book form in [[Vienna]] in 1932. The originals of the watercolours were presented by the President of Poland [[Ignacy Mościcki]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1935. They are now stored at the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Haggadah'' and moving to London. ===

This sketch depicts the newly appointed Chancellor of Germany [[Adolf Hitler]] dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]], a clear reference to the antagonist in the biblical story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] of the Hebrew slaves from Egypt.]]

Szyk's art became even more politically engaged when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933. Szyk started drawing caricatures of Germany's Führer as early as 1933; probably the first was a pencil drawing of Hitler dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings anticipated another great series of Szyk's drawings – the ''[[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]]'', which is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The ''Haggadah'' is a very important and popular story in Jewish culture and religion about the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] or departure of the [[Israelites]] from [[ancient Egypt]], which is read every year during the [[Passover Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the complete Hebrew and English texts of the ''Hagaddah'' on website [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1735/jewish/The-Haggadah.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Szyk illustrated the Haggadah in 48 miniature paintings in the years 1934–1936. The antisemitic politics in Germany led Szyk introduce some contemporary elements to it. For example, he painted the Jewish [[parable]] of the Four Sons, in which the "wicked son" was portrayed as a man wearing German clothes, with a Hitler-like moustache and a green Alpine hat. The political intent of the series was even stronger in its original version: he painted upon the red snakes the swastika, the symbol of the [[Third Reich]].

In 1937, Arthur Szyk went to London to supervise the publication of the ''Haggadah''. However, in the three years leading to its publication, the artist had to agree to many compromises, including painting over the swastikas. It is not clear whether he did it under the pressure from his publisher or from British politicians who pursued the policy of [[appeasement]] with to Germany. The ''Haggadah'' was at last published in 1940, dedicated it to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and with a translation (of the Hebrew) and commentary by British Jewish historian Cecil Roth. The work was widely acclaimed by critics; according to ''[[The Times]]'' of London Literary Supplement, it was "worthy to be placed among the most beautiful of books that the hand of man has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/szyk-haggadah/ The Szyk Haggadah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.

===New York World's Fair, 1939===
The last major exhibition of Szyk's works before the outbreak of World War II was the presentation of his paintings at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], which opened in April 1939 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Pavilion prominently featured Szyk's twenty-three paintings depicting the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States; many works specifically highlighted the historic political connections between the two countries, as if to remind the viewer that Poland remained a suitable ally in a turbulent time.. (Twenty of the images were reproduced as postcards in Kraków in 1938 and were available for sale.). In this series, Szyk depicted the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States, and highlighted historic connections between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==

=== Reaction to the outbreak of the war ===

The German invasion of Poland found Szyk in Britain where he supervised the publication of the ''Haggadah'' and continued to exhibit his works. The artist immediately reacted to the outbreak of World War II by producing war-themed works.  One feature which distinguished Szyk from other caricaturists who were active during World War II was that he concentrated on the presentation of the enemy in his works and seldom depicted the leaders or soldiers of the Allies. This was a characteristic feature of Szyk's work till the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1940, the exhibition of his 72 caricatures entitled ''War and "Kultur" in Poland'' opened at the Fine Art Society in London, and was well received by the critics. As the reviewer of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:

{{Quote|There are three leading motives in the exhibition: the brutality of the Germans – and the more primitive savagery of the Russians, the heroism of the Poles, and the suffering of the Jews. The cumulative effect of the exhibition is immensely powerful because nothing in it appears to be a hasty judgment, but part of the unrelenting pursuit of an evil so firmly grasped that it can be dwelt upon with artistic satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Polish War Satires : Miniatures by Mr Szyk'', in: ''The Times'', January 11, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Szyk drew more and more caricatures directed at the Axis powers and their leaders, and his popularity steadily grew. In 1940, the American publisher [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] offered to publish a collection of his drawings. Szyk agreed, and the result was the 1941 book ''The New Order'', available months before the United States joined the war. [[Thomas Craven]] declared on the dust jacket of ''The New Order'' that Szyk:
{{Quote|…makes not only cartoons but beautifully composed pictures which suggest, in their curiously decorative quality, the inspired illuminations of the early religious manuscripts. His designs are as compact as a bomb, extraordinarily lucid in statement, firm and incisive in line, and deadly in their characterizations. (…) These are remarkable documents.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Szyk, ''The New Order'', New York, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some years later, in 1946, art critic [[Carl Clinton Van Doren|Carl Van Doren]] said of Szyk:
{{Quote|There is no one more certain to be alive two hundred years from now. Just as we turn back to Hogarth and Goya for the living images of their age, so our descendants will turn back to Arthur Szyk for the most graphic history of Hitler and Hirohito and Mussolini. Here is the damning essence of what has happened; here is the piercing summary of what men have thought and felt.}}

=== Moving to the United States and war caricatures ===

At the beginning of July 1940, with the support of the British government and the [[Polish government-in-exile]], Arthur Szyk left Britain for North America, on assignment to popularize in the New World the struggle of the British and Polish nations against [[Nazism]]. His first destination on the continent was Canada, where he was welcomed enthusiastically by the media: they wrote about his engagement in the fight with Nazi Germany, and the Halifax-based ''[[The Chronicle Herald|Morning Herald]]'' even reported about the alleged bounty Hitler had put on Szyk.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Herald'', July 13, 1940. The information about the alleged bounty was also repeated by American media, but it is not confirmed by reliable sources.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, Szyk and his wife and daughter went to New York City, where he lived till 1945. His son, George, had enlisted in the [[Free French Forces]] commanded by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival in the U.S., Szyk was inspired by Roosevelt's 1941 "[[Four Freedoms]]" [[State of the Union]] speech to illustrate the Four Freedoms, preceding [[Norman Rockwell]]'s Four Freedoms by two years;&lt;ref&gt;"Visualizing the Four Freedoms: FDR's Fighting Artist Arthur Szyk" by Allison Claire Chang, ''The Nation'', January 8, 2016 (online only)&lt;/ref&gt; these were used as [[poster stamp]]s during the war, and appeared on the Four Freedoms Award which was presented to [[Harry Truman]], [[George Marshall]] and [[Herbert H. Lehman]]. Szyk became an immensely popular artist in his new home country the war, especially after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the United States into the war. His caricatures of the leaders of the Axis powers (Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito) and other drawings appeared practically everywhere: in newspapers, magazines (including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]] (cover caricature of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] in December 1941)'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''), on posters, postcards and stamps, in secular, religious and military publications, on public and military buildings. He also produced advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[U.S. Steel]], and exhibited in the galleries of M. Knodler &amp; Co., Andre Seligmann, Inc., Messrs. Wildenstein &amp; Co., the [[Philadelphia Art Alliance]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in San Francisco, and the [[White House]]. More than 25 exhibitions were staged altogether in the United States during the war years. At the end of the war, in 1945, his drawing ''Two Down and One to Go'' was used in a propaganda film calling American soldiers to the final assault on Japan. According to the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, the posters with Szyk's drawings enjoyed even bigger popularity with American soldiers than [[pin-up girl]]s put on the walls of American military bases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Answer'', New York, September 1945, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than one million American soldiers saw Szyk's in reproduction at some 500 locations administered by the United Services Organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morton Weinstein presenting Eleanor Roosevelt with a book by Arthur Szyk - NARA - 195394.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] presented with an Arthur Szyk work in 1956. Szyk himself died 5 years earlier.]]

In recognition for his services in the fight against Nazism, [[Fascism]], and the Japanese aggression, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], First Lady and wife of President F. D. Roosevelt, wrote about Szyk several times in her newspaper column, ''My Day''.&lt;ref&gt;George Washington University, The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, "My Day" electronic edition: https://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/ Accessed May 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1943, she wrote:

{{Quote|...I had a few minutes to stop in to see an exhibition of war satires and miniatures by Arthur Szyk at the Seligman Galleries on East 57th Street. This exhibition is sponsored by the Writers' War Board. I know of no other miniaturist doing quite this kind of work. In its way it fights the war against Hitlerism as truly as any of us who cannot actually be on the fighting fronts today.}}

=== Social justice on the home front  ===
Though Szyk was a fierce opponent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the rest of the [[Axis Powers]], he did not avoid topics or themes which presented the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in a less favourable light. Szyk criticized the United Kingdom for its policies in the Middle East, especially its practice of imposing limits on Jewish emigration to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Despite the fact that the British government had provided for the creation of a Jewish state in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], in May 1939, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] passed the so-called [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]], which limited the number of Jewish immigrants to the Holy Land to 10,000 yearly, a policy that had tragic consequences for the Jews in Hitler-occupied Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;) Szyk also criticized the apparent passivity of American-Jewish organizations towards the tragedy of their European fellows.&lt;ref&gt;The rescue of European Jewry was personal for Szyk: his mother and his brother were in the ghettos of Łódź. (Ultimately Szyk's mother, Eugenia Szyk, and possibly her Polish-Christian companion, was murdered at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in 1942. See Luckert, The Art and Politics of Arthur Szyk, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the work of [[Hillel Kook]], also known as Peter Bergson, a member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] organization [[Irgun]], who mounted a publicity campaign in American society whose aim was to draw the American public's attention to the fate of the European Jews. Szyk illustrated for example full-page advertisements (sometimes with copy by screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]]) which were published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The artist also spoke against racial tensions in the United States and criticized the fact that the black population did not have the same rights as the whites. In one of his drawings, there are two American soldiers – one black and one white – escorting German prisoners of war. When the white one asks the black: "And what would you do with Hitler?", the black one answers: "I would have made him a Negro and dropped him somewhere in the U.S.A."&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk's attitude to his mother country, Poland, was very interesting and full of contradictions. Even though he regarded himself both as Jewish and Polish and showed the suffering of the Poles (not only those of Jewish descent) in the Russian-occupied Polish territories in his drawings, even though he benefited from financial support of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (at least at the beginning of the war), Szyk sometimes presented that government in a negative light, especially at the end of World War II. In a controversial drawing dated 1944, a group of debating Polish politicians are shown as opponents of Roosevelt, [[Joseph Stalin]], the "Bolshevik agent" [[Winston Churchill]], and at the same time adherents of Father [[Charles Coughlin]], known for his antisemitic  views, as well as "(national) democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Szyk alludes to the [[National Democracy]], a pre-war right-wing political movement in Poland, known for its nationalistic and antisemitic views.&lt;/ref&gt; and "(national) socialism." Around 1943, Szyk, a former participant in the Polish–Soviet War, also completely changed his opinions on the Soviet Union. His drawing from 1944 already depicts outright a soldier of the Moscow-supported [[People's Army of Poland]] next to a [[Red Army]] soldier, both liberating Poland.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever his political views, in July 1942 Szyk took the time to look after the family of the Polish diplomat and poet General [[Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski]] when the General committed suicide. He invited his wife [[Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska]] and daughter Zuzanna to stay with his family for six weeks in the country.

=== Book illustrations ===

Even though caricatures dominated Szyk's artistic output during the war, he was still engaged in other areas of art. In 1940, the American publisher [[George Macy]], who saw his illustrations for the ''Haggadah'' at an exhibition in London, asked him to illustrate the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'', a collection of poems of the Iranian poet [[Omar Khayyám]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the artist started work on illustrations for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', published in 1946; he also illustrated collections of fairy tales by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (''Andersen's Fairy Tales'', 1945) and [[Charles Perrault]] (''[[Mother Goose]]'', which was not published).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar: final years ==
In 1945, Arthur Szyk and his family moved from New York City to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] where he lived till the end of his life. The end of the war released him from the duty to fight Nazism through his caricatures; a large collection of drawings from the war period was published by the Heritage Press in 1946 in book form as ''Ink and Blood: A Book of Drawings''. The artist returned to book illustrations, working for example on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and, most notably, books telling [[Bible]] stories, such as ''Pathways through the Bible'' by Mortimer J. Cohen (1946), ''The Book of Job'' (1946), ''The Book of Ruth'' (1947), ''The Ten Commandments'' (1947), ''The Story of Joseph and his Brothers'' (1949). Some of the books illustrated by Szyk were also published posthumously, including ''The Arabian Nights Entertainments'' (1954) and ''The Book of Esther'' (1974). He was also commissioned by Canadian entrepreneur and stamp connoisseur, [[Kasimir Bileski]], to create illustrations for the Visual History of Nations (or [[United Nations]]) series of stamps; though the project never came to fruition, Szyk did design stamp album frontispieces for more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Israel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Arthur Szyk was granted American citizenship on May 22, 1948, but he reportedly experienced the happiest day in his life eight days earlier: on May 14, the day of the announcement of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the memoirs of Julia Szyk, the artist's wife, who recorded her husband's reaction to that event. Her memoirs are kept by The Arthur Szyk Archives in Burlingame, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Szyk commemorated that event by creating the richly decorated illumination of the Hebrew text of the declaration. Two years later, on July 4, 1950, he also exhibited the richly illuminated text of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The artist continued to be politically engaged in his country, criticizing the [[McCarthyism]] policy (the ubiquitous atmosphere of suspicion and searching for sympathizers of [[communism]] in American artistic and academic circles) and signs of [[racism]]. One of his well-known drawings from 1949 shows two armed members of [[Ku Klux Klan]] approaching a tied-up African American; the caption for the drawing reads, "Do not forgive them, oh Lord, for they do know what they do." Like many outspoken artists of his era, Szyk was suspected by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which accused him of being a member of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]] and six other suspicious organizations. Szyk himself, however, repudiated these accusations of alleged sympathy for communism; his son George sent Judge Simon Rifkind a memorandum outlining his father's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell. p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Szyk died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in New Canaan on September 13, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized by Rabbi [[Ben Zion Bokser]], who said: {{quotation |:"Arthur Szyk was a great artist. Endowed by God with a rare sensitivity to beauty and with a rare skill in giving it graphic representation, he used his talents to create a series of works of splendor and magnificence that will live forever in the history of art. But Arthur Szyk was more than a great artist. He was a great man, a champion of justice, a fearless warrior in the cause of every humanitarian endeavor. His art was his tool and he used it brilliantly. It was in his hands a weapon of struggle with which he fought for the causes close to his heart"; and by Judge Simon H. Rifkind, who said: "The Arthur Szyk whom the world knows, the Arthur Szyk of the wondrous color, and of the beautiful design, that Arthur Szyk whom the world mourns today—he is indeed not dead at all. How can he be when the Arthur Szyk who is known to mankind lives and is immortal and will remain immortal as long as the love of truth and beauty prevails among mankind?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html The Arthur Szyk Society – Eulogies and Tributes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106111605/http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html |date=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The immense popularity Szyk enjoyed in the United States and Europe in his lifetime gradually flagged after his death. From the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, the artist's works were seldom exhibited in American museums. This changed in 1991 when the non-profit organization [[Arthur Szyk Society|The Arthur Szyk Society]] was established in [[Orange County, California]]. The founder of the Society, George Gooche, rediscovered Szyk's works and staged the exhibition "Arthur Szyk – Illuminator" in Los Angeles. In 1997, the seat of the Society was transferred to [[Burlingame, California]], and a new Board of [[Trustee]]s was elected, headed by rabbi, curator and antiquarian [[Irvin Ungar]]. The Society's work resulted in staging many exhibitions of Szyk's works in American cities in the 1990s and 2000s. The Society also maintains a large educational website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.org See The Arthur Szyk Society's website]&lt;/ref&gt; holds lectures, and produces publications on the artist. In April 2017, the Ungar collection of his work, consisting of 450 paintings, drawings and sketches, was purchased for $10.1 million by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life]], through a donation by Taube Philanthropies, the largest single monetary gift to acquire art in UC Berkeley history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Magnes-museum-gets-big-collection-of-Jewish-art-11044902.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/03/gift-to-the-magnes-collection-of-jewish-art-and-life/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot== 
In 1969, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and sarcastic Emily Summerspring arrive at the El Royale, where they meet the hotel's only employee, Miles Miller.

Upon checking into the honeymoon suite, Sullivan (in reality an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Dwight Broadbeck, sent to investigate the hotel and remove evidence of their operations) discovers a passageway leading into a corridor looking onto [[one-way mirror]]s in each of the hotel's rooms, as well as a 16mm camera setup. Broadbeck witnesses an apparent kidnapping in progress in Emily's room; he is instructed to not to interfere with the kidnapping, and to sabotage the guests' vehicles to prevent any of them from escaping. Meanwhile, Flynn invites Sweet to join him for dinner. She sees him drugging her drink and knocks him unconscious with a bottle, running out of the hotel to escape. Miles finds Flynn and reveals to him the secret passageway, afterwards explaining that "management" has instructed him to film the guests and send the footage to them. However, he chose to hold back one particularly incriminating film reel of a recently deceased public figure.

Against orders, Broadbeck attempts to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. Emily opens fire on Broadbeck, killing him and accidentally injuring Miles who was watching from behind the mirror. Sweet attempts to escape in her car after witnessing the murder, but Flynn arrives. He reveals that he is really a criminal named Donald O'Kelly, who was imprisoned after a botched robbery ten years earlier. Recently freed on parole, O'Kelly has returned to the El Royale in priest garb to retrieve the money which his brother Felix had hidden there before being killed in a double cross ten years earlier - but owing to his failing memory he can't recall which room it was in. He had attempted to drug Sweet to gain access to her room, believing the cash to be buried there. The two agree to split the cash amongst themselves.

In the lobby, Emily and Rose, having discovered the corridor, interrogate Miles about the surveillance operation. It is revealed that Emily has forcibly removed her sister from a cult led by Billy Lee, a charismatic and sadistic figure responsible for a string of murders in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. However, Rose reveals that she has already called Billy about their location. As O'Kelly and Sweet attempt to leave with the money, Billy Lee and his cultists arrive and hold them hostage along with Emily and Miles.

While interrogating and terrorizing the group, Lee learns of the money and the film, which he realizes is worth much more than the money. In a sadistic game of roulette, Lee kills Emily. Using a brief power outage to his advantage, O'Kelly attacks Lee as the hotel lounge catches fire. During the chaos, Miles reveals that he served as a sniper in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] who killed 123 people. At Sweet's insistence, he picks up a gun and kills Lee and the other cultists. A distraught Rose stabs Miles, but is shot by O'Kelly afterwards. Before Miles passes, Sweet tells O'Kelly to [[Confession (religion)|absolve]] him of his guilt over his actions in Vietnam, which he does. O'Kelly and Sweet retrieve the money and Sweet tosses the film into the fire before the pair flee the hotel.

Not long after, Sweet performs at a show in [[Reno]] for the crowd, as O'Kelly proudly looks on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">'''Bond paper''' is a high quality durable [[writing paper]] similar to [[bank paper]] but having a [[Paper density|weight]] greater than 50&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The most common weights are 60&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;lb), 75&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (20&amp;nbsp;lb) and 90 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;lb). The name comes from its having originally been made for documents such as [[government bond]]s. It is now used for [[letterhead]]s and other [[stationery]] and as paper for electronic [[Computer printer|printers]]. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp, which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Chinese folklore''' encompasses the folklore of [[China]], and includes songs, poetry, dances, puppetry, and tales. It often tells stories of [[human nature]], historical or legendary events, love, and the supernatural, or stories explaining natural phenomena and distinctive landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Giskin, Howard.  ''Chinese Folktales.''  (NTC Publishing Group, Chicago, 1997).  {{ISBN|0-8442-5927-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Chinese mythology]] it forms an important element in [[Chinese popular religion]].

==Folktales==
[[File:Niulang and Zhinv (Long Corridor).JPG|thumb|The reunion of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]''. Artwork in the [[Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]].]]

The main influences on Chinese folk tales have been [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Some folktales may have arrived from Germany; others have no known western counterparts, but are widespread throughout East Asia.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China"&gt;Eberhard, Wolfram, ''Folktales of China.''(1965). University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1965. University of Congress Catalog Card Number: 65-25440&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folktales include a vast variety of forms such as myths, legends, fables, etc. A number of collections of such tales, such as [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'', now remain popular. 

Chinese folklore contains many symbolic folk meanings for the objects and animals within the folktales. One example of this is the symbolic meaning behind frogs and toads. In the "Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, Chang E", frogs and toads are a symbol of wealth and prosperity as well as symbolize fertility, regeneration, yin, and immortality. Each Chinese folktale includes this kind of representation of various objects and animals and uses symbolic messages through its characters and usually strives to convey a message that instills the reader with some sort of virtuous insight. These messages are vital to Chinese culture and through these folktales, they will be passed down to future generations to also learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Shanshan, Y. (2016). Frogs and Toads in Chinese Myths, Legends, and Folklore. Chinese America: History &amp; Perspectives, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of folklore on other media==
[[File:Mawangdui silk banner from tomb no1.jpg|thumb|The Journey to eternal life of Lady Dai (Xin Chui). Mawangdui, [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], about 168 [[before the Common Era]].]]

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for Chinese writers and poets for centuries. Folk songs which were originally partnered with dance and other styles of performing arts, provided inspiration for courtly poetry. Classical fiction began in the [[Han Dynasty]] and was modeled after oral traditions, while [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era dramatic plays were influenced by folk plays.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for visual imagery by Chinese weavers, painters and watercolorists, florists. One of the most striking examples is a silk funerary banner (circa 168 BC) that contains a number of stories from early China.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=cuddgTWyx50C&amp;dq=hare+and+toad+on+the+moon&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Chinese Myths, by Anne Birrell. University of Texas Press, Sep 15, 2000 - Literary Criticism - 80 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern iterations of traditional Chinese stories can be found internationally as well as in native Chinese literature.  [[Laurence Yep]]'s ''[[The Magic Paintbrush]]'', [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]'s ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'', and [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' all borrow from Chinese folklore traditions.

==Study of Chinese folklore==
The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', the earliest known Chinese collection of poetry, contains 160 folk songs in addition to courtly songs and hymns. One tradition holds that [[Confucius]] himself collected these songs, while another says that an emperor compiled them as a means to gauge the mood of the people and the effectiveness of his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in the ''Classic of Poetry'', helping to secure the ''Classic of Poetry'''s place among the ''[[Five Classics]]''. After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confucius's endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980115021723/http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/english/worldlit/wldocs/churchill/bksongs.htm |archivedate=1998-01-15 |df= }} /&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1910s, Chinese folklore began to gain popularity as an area of study with the beginnings of the movement to formally adopt [[Vernacular Chinese]] as the language of education and literature. Because Vernacular Chinese was the dialect in which most folklore was created, this movement brought to scholars' attention the influences that Vernacular Chinese folklore had upon classical literature. [[Hu Shih]] of the [[Peking University]], who had published several articles in support of the adoption of Vernacular Chinese, concluded that when Chinese writers drew their inspiration from folk traditions such as traditional tales and songs, Chinese literature experienced a renaissance. When writers neglected these sources, they lost touch with the people of the nation. A new emphasis on the study of folklore, Hu concluded, could therefore usher in a new renaissance of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

The Folksong Studies Movement became a key contributor to establishing Chinese Folklore as a modern academic discipline. This movement was founded by students and professors at Peking University in 1918. They were successful in creating a field of study that focused on literature pertaining to Chinese folklore and attempted to bring to light the early traditions and culture of Chinese folklore in order to reestablish China's national spirit.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A rising sense of national identity was also partially responsible for spurring the new interest in traditional folklore.  The first issue of the ''Folk-Song Weekly'', a publication issued by the Folk-Song Research Society, stated that "Based on the folk songs, on the real feeling of the nation, a kind of new national poetry may be produced."&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

Some folklore enthusiasts also hoped to further social reforms by their work. To help improve the condition of the Chinese people, it was believed, it was necessary to understand their ideas, beliefs, and customs.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt; After China emerged from the [[Maoism|Maoist]] period in the late 1970s, the state had an increasingly more accepting position toward academic research on China’s cultural traditions and folklore. Forbidden traditions and practices in early Chinese history were at this point in time becoming more relevant and accepted within the Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;AN, D., &amp; YANG, L. (2015). Chinese Folklore Since the Late 1970s. Asian Ethnology, 74(2), 273-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Communist and Communist thinkers were especially energetic in this belief. In the time leading up to the founding of the [[Communist Party of China]], many folk songs and stories were collected by Communist thinkers and scholars. Often, they were reinvented and reinterpreted to emphasize such themes as the virtue of the working commoner and the evil of aristocracy, while stories that expressed praise for the emperor were frequently left out of Communist collections. Some folk tales and folk plays that exist today may in fact have been deliberately written by Communist authors to emphasize particular social morals.&lt;ref name="Folktales of China" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30184">The '''creative industries''' refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the [[cultural industry|cultural industries]] (especially in Europe {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=14}} or the creative economy {{harv|Howkins|2001}}, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean ([http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896 Buitrago &amp; Duque 2013]).

Howkins' creative economy comprises [[advertising]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[crafts]], [[design]], [[fashion]], [[film industry|film]], [[music industry|music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]], [[research and development|R&amp;D]], [[software]], [[toy]]s and [[game]]s, [[Television|TV]] and [[radio]], and [[video game]]s {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. Some scholars consider that education industry, including public and private services, is forming a part of creative industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), [http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf "Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105107/http://www.nordicinnovation.org/Global/_Publications/Reports/2008/Creative%20Industries%20education%20in%20the%20Nordic%20countries%20-%20A%20brief%20portrait.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}; Mœglin, Pierre (2001), Les Industries éducatives, Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt; There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv| DCMS| 2006}}.

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that "[[human creativity]] is the ultimate economic resource" {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002|p=xiii}}, and that "the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation" {{Harv|Landry|Bianchini|1995|p=4}}.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of "creative industries" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}{{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=12}}{{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|pp=11–12}}, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms "creative industries", "cultural industries" and "creative economy" {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=11–14}}{{Harv|UNCTAD|2008|p=12}}.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an "irreducible core" concerned with "the exchange of finance for rights in [[intellectual property]]", {{harv|Lash|Urry|1994|p=117}}. This echoes the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:"those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property" {{harv|DCMS|2001|p=04}}

{{As of | 2015}} the DCMS definition recognizes nine ''creative sectors'', namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|title=Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport – Creative Industries Economic Estimates January 2015|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=13 January 2015|website=gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210124534/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/394668/Creative_Industries_Economic_Estimates_-_January_2015.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Advertising]] and [[marketing]]
# [[Architecture]] &lt;!--and [[landscaping]] (e.g. [https://www.salford.gov.uk/d/Development_Prospectus.pdf Development prospectus])--&gt;
# [[Crafts]]
# [[Design]]: [[product design|product]], [[graphic design|graphic]] and [[fashion design]]&lt;!--(see also [[communication design]])--&gt;

# [[Information technology|IT]], [[software engineering|software]] and [[computer services]]
# [[Publishing]]
# [[Museum]]s, [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[libraries]]
# [[Music industry|Music]], [[performing arts|performing]] and [[visual arts]]

To this list [[John Howkins]] would add [[toys]] and games, also including the much broader area of [[research and development]] in science and technology {{harv|Howkins|2001|pp=88–117}}. It has also been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that [[gastronomy]] belongs in such a list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|title=Does cuisine have a place in the Creative Economy and what role does Creative Leadership play in its production?|author=|date=18 May 2011|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503134414/https://macedefence.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/does-cuisine-have-a-place-in-the-creative-economy-and-what-role-does-creative-leadership-play-in-its-production/|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fields of [[engineering]] do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in "non-cultural" corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms "the core cultural industries" of [[advertising]] and marketing, [[broadcasting]], [[Film industry|film]], internet and [[Music industry|music]] industries, [[publishing|print]] and [[electronic publishing]], and [[computer games|video and computer games]]. His definition only includes those industries that create "texts"' or "cultural artefacts" and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction {{Harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|pp=12–14}}.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations{{which|date=June 2013}} have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the division into sectors obscures a divide between [[lifestyle business]], non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned {{harv|Hesmondhalgh|2002|p=13}}.

Some areas, such as [[Hong Kong]], have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the [[value chain]]. They adopt the [[WIPO]]'s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|title=The Orange Economy: An Infinite Opportunity|first1=Buitrago Restrepo, Pedro|last1=Felipe|first2=Duque Márquez,|last2=Iván|date=1 October 2013|website=iadb.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092916/http://www.iadb.org/en/publications/publication-detail,7101.html?id=70896|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as the "group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property."

Others{{who|date=June 2013}} have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment ([[visual arts]]; [[performing arts]]; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music [[industrial sector]], and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a [[musician]].

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend [[Gig (musical performance)|gigs]], writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
[[File:Township Cat.JPG|thumb|200px|A toy cat produced in a South-African township, made from used plastic bags and old wire]]

According to Caves (2000), creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#''Nobody knows principle'': Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers' reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#''Art for art's sake'': Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by 'humdrum' jobs.
#''Motley crew principle'': For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#''Infinite variety'': Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#''A list/B list'': Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#''Time flies'': When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#''Ars longa'': Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke [[copyright]] protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by 'art for art's sake'. The 'ars longa' property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The 'time flies' property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the 'cultural industries'==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of '''[[Cultural industry|cultural industries]]'''. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on [[cultural tourism]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]], [[sports]] and [[outdoor activities]], and a variety of 'way of life' activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of [[Hobbies|hobbyist]] concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also [[Cultural Institutions Studies|cultural institutions studies]].)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]], argue for a wider focus on the products of [[knowledge workers]], and judge the '[[creative class]]' (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida's focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative [[workforce]]. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the '[[creative class]]' provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and [[multiculturalism]] in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance. {{Harvard citation|Florida|2002}}

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific [[research and development]] are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world's economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific [[Research and Development]] suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

Taking the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than [[hospitality]] or [[utilities]] and deliver four times the output due to [[agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK's [[working population]], though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as [[retail]] and [[manufacturing]].

Within the creative industries sector and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are [[design]], [[publishing]], and [[television]] and [[radio]]. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

The complex [[supply chains]] in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the [[gross value added]] by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as [[advertising]], whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as [[crafts]]. Not surprisingly, perhaps, competition in product-focused areas tends to be more intense with a tendency to drive the production end of the supply chain to become a [[commodity business]].

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person's profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs.  Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of €500 billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed [[Creative Europe|'Creative Europe' programme]] (July 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|title=Creative Europe - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Creative Europe|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430180132/http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm|archivedate=30 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }} with Violaine Hacker&lt;/ref&gt; The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]]. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of ''Work and Occupations'' on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions.  Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists' skill sets allow them to "work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }}, in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are "catalysts of change and innovation" because they "face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy" (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that "studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today's (and tomorrow's) workforce."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), [http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506232653/http://wox.sagepub.com/content/40/4/337.full.pdf+html |date=2015-05-06 }} in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like "skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories". Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?
# What is the nature of their work and the resources they draw upon?
# How do different network structures produce different opportunity spaces?
# How do artistic workers create and manage planned serendipity—the spaces and exchanges that produce unexpected collaborations and opportunities? 
# How do creative workers broker and synthesize across occupational, genre, geographic, and industry boundaries to create new possibilities? (Tepper &amp; Lingo, 2013)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as [[manufacturing]], many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new [[knowledge economy]], capable perhaps of delivering [[urban regeneration]], often through initiatives linked to exploitation of [[cultural heritage]] that leads to increased [[tourism]]. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the [[United Kingdom]] will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer [[creative entrepreneurship]] as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK's creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in £112.5 billion to the UK economy (DCMS ''Creative Industries Mapping Document'' 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become 'increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world'.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stuart, Ryan, Mark David, Keane, Michael &amp; Ordonez, Diego (2008), ‘Financing Creative Industries in Developing Countries’, in Diana Barrowclough and Zeljka Kozul-Wright eds, [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf "Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050038/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/17984/1/17984.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, Routledge, London and New York, pp. 65-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham ''et al.'' (2009) put it, 'the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy'. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist [[Mari Pangestu|Dr Mari Pangestu]] appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

The '''Daniel Pearl Foundation''' is a foundation based in the United States.  The foundation was formed by his parents Ruth and [[Judea Pearl]] after musician and [[Wall Street Journal]] reporter [[Daniel Pearl]] was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in 2002.  The organization's mission is to promote cross-cultural understanding through journalism, music, and innovative communications.

The honorary board of the Daniel Pearl Foundation includes [[Christiane Amanpour]]; former President [[Bill Clinton]]; [[Abdul Sattar Edhi]]; Danny Gill; [[John L. Hennessy]]; [[Ted Koppel]]; [[Queen Noor of Jordan]]; [[Sari Nusseibeh]]; [[Mariane Pearl]]; [[Itzhak Perlman]]; [[Harold M. Schulweis]]; Craig Sherman; [[Paul Steiger]]; and [[Elie Wiesel]].

==Initiatives==

Daniel Pearl was a [[violin]]ist in addition to being a journalist.  To honor his musical spirit and promote tolerance, '''Daniel Pearl World Music Days''' is a network of global concerts celebrated each year from October 1 to 15, (around the journalist's birthday).  According to its website, Daniel Pearl World Music Days uses "the power of music to promote tolerance and inspire respect for differences". The first Daniel Pearl World Music Days was held on October 10, 2002, and now yearly includes more than 8,900 performances in 119 countries.

Among additional initiatives:

:'''PEARL World Youth News''' provides an online journalist certification course for High School students.

:Annual '''Daniel Pearl Journalism and Editorial Fellowships''' bring foreign journalists and editors to work for six months in a US newsroom.

:'''Daniel Pearl Media Internship Program''' provides media internships to young Israelis and Palestinians who have attended a peace camp.

:'''The Daniel Pearl Dialogues for Muslim-Jewish Understanding''' is a traveling public dialogue in which professors Judea Pearl and Akbar Ahmed discuss Muslim-Jewish relationships.

:'''Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Journalism''' is an annual award split into two parts, one for American journalists and one for international journalists.

[[File:tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|The growth rings of a tree at [[Bristol Zoo]], England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest.]]
'''Dendrochronology'''  (or '''tree-ring dating''') is the [[scientific method]] of [[chronological dating|dating]] tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history.

Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old [[panel painting]]s on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in [[radiocarbon dating]] to calibrate radiocarbon ages.&lt;ref name=Grissino&gt;{{cite|title=The Science of Tree Rings: Principles of Dendrochronology|first=Henri D.|last=Grissino-Mayer|publisher=Department of Geography, The University of Tennessee|date=n.d.|url=http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|accessdate=October 23, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104042215/http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/principles.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New growth in [[tree]]s occurs in a layer of cells near the bark. A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings. Each ring marks a complete cycle of seasons, or one year, in the tree's life.&lt;ref name=Grissino /&gt; {{Asof|2013}}, the oldest tree-ring measurements in the Northern Hemisphere are a floating sequence extending from about 12,580 to 13,900 years.&lt;ref name="INTCAL13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reimer |first1=Paula J. |year=2013 |title=IntCal13 and Marine13 radiocarbon age calibration curves 0–50,000 years cal BP |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=55 |pages=1869–1887 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.55.16947 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516010345/https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/16947 |archivedate=2014-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrochronology derives from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:δένδρον|δένδρον]]}} (''{{lang|la|dendron}}''), meaning "tree", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}} (''{{lang|la|khronos}}''), meaning "time", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}} ''({{lang|la|[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]}}''), "the study of".

== History ==
The Greek botanist [[Theophrastus]] (ca. 371 – ca. 287 BC) first mentioned that the wood of trees has rings.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus with Arthur Hort, trans., ''Enquiry into Plants'', volume 1 (London, England: William Heinemann, 1916), Book V, [https://archive.org/stream/enquiryintoplant01theouoft#page/422/mode/2up p. 423.] From p. 423: "Moreover, the wood of the silver-fir has many layers, like an onion; there is always another beneath that which is visible, and the wood is composed of such layers throughout." Although many sources claim that Theophrastus recognized that trees form growth rings annually, this is not true.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the history of dendrochronology, see:

During the first half of the 20th century, the astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] founded the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]] at the [[University of Arizona]]. Douglass sought to better understand cycles of sunspot activity and reasoned that changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on earth, which would subsequently be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns (''i.e.'', sunspots → climate → tree rings).

[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of [[wood]] is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and roots, to form a growth ring.]]
Horizontal [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] cut through the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] can reveal growth rings, also referred to as ''tree rings'' or ''annual rings''. Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]. Visible rings result from the change in growth speed through the [[season]]s of the year; thus, critical for the title method, one ring generally marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Removal of the bark of the tree in a particular area may cause deformation of the rings as the plant overgrows the scar.

The rings are more visible in trees which have grown in [[temperate zone]]s, where the seasons differ more markedly. The inner portion of a growth ring forms early in the growing season, when growth is comparatively rapid (hence the wood is less dense) and is known as "early wood" (or "spring wood", or "late-spring wood"&lt;ref&gt;"Early wood" is used in preference to "spring wood", as the latter term may not correspond to that time of year in climates where early wood is formed in the early summer (e.g. [[Canada]]) or in autumn, as in some [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] species.&lt;/ref&gt;); the outer portion is the "late wood" (sometimes termed "summer wood", often being produced in the summer, though sometimes in the autumn) and is denser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv |last= Capon |first= Brian|title= Botany for Gardeners |year= 2005 |pages= 66–67 |edition= 2nd |isbn= 0-88192-655-8 |publisher= Timber Publishing|location= Portland, OR}} {{better source|date= November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pinus taeda crossx7358.JPG|thumb|right|240px|''[[Pinus taeda]]'' Cross section showing annual rings, [[Cheraw, South Carolina]].]]
Many trees in temperate zones produce one growth-ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring, while a drought year may result in a very narrow one.

Direct reading of tree ring chronologies is a complex science, for several reasons. First, contrary to the single-ring-per-year paradigm, alternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid-summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. In addition, particular tree-species may present "missing rings", and this influences the selection of trees for study of long time-spans. For instance, missing rings are rare in oak and [[elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;The only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]".{{cite web | url = http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | title= Useful Tree Species for Tree-Ring Dating | author= Lori Martinez | year= 1996 | publisher= | location= | accessdate= 2008-11-08 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108094321/http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/lorim/good.html | archivedate= 2008-11-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical to the science, trees from the same region tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period of chronological study. Researchers can compare and match these patterns  ring-for-ring with patterns from trees which have grown at the same time in the same geographical zone (and therefore under similar climatic conditions). When one can match these tree-ring patterns across successive trees in the same locale, in overlapping fashion, chronologies can be built up—both for entire geographical regions and for sub-regions. Moreover, wood from ancient structures with known chronologies can be matched to the tree-ring data (a technique called ''cross-dating''), and the age of the wood can thereby be determined precisely. Dendrochronologists originally carried out cross-dating by visual inspection; more recently, they have harnessed computers to do the task, applying statistical techniques to assess the matching. To eliminate individual variations in tree-ring growth, dendrochronologists take the smoothed average of the tree-ring widths of multiple tree-samples to build up a '''ring history''', a process termed replication. A tree-ring history whose beginning- and end-dates are not known is called a ''floating chronology''. It can be anchored by cross-matching a section against another chronology (tree-ring history) whose dates are known.

Dendrochronological equation defines the law of growth of tree rings.
The equation was proposed by Russian biophysicist Alexandr N. Tetearing in his work "Theory of populations" &lt;ref name=Tetearing2012&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Alexandr N. Tetearing
 |title=Theory of populations |year=2012 |page=583 |isbn=978-1-365-56080-4 |publisher=SSO Foundation |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{k_v\, \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} \, \frac{d\big(M^{\tfrac{1}{3}}(t)\big)}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Delta L&lt;/math&gt; is width of annual ring, &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; is time (in years), &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density of wood, &lt;math&gt; k_v &lt;/math&gt; is some coefficient, &lt;math&gt; M(t) &lt;/math&gt; is function of mass growth of the tree.

With the neglection of natural sinusoidal oscillations in tree mass,
the formula of the changes in the annual ring width is:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) = -\dfrac{ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t} }{3 k_v \rho^{\tfrac{1}{3}} (c_4+ c_1 e^{-a_1 t}+ c_2 e^{-a_2 t})^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

There &lt;math&gt; c_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_2 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c_4 &lt;/math&gt; are some coefficients, &lt;math&gt; a_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_2 &lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

The formula is useful for correct approximation of samples data before data normalization procedure.

The typical forms of the function &lt;math&gt;
\Delta L(t) &lt;/math&gt; of annual growth of wood ring are  shown in the figures.

== Sampling and dating ==
Dendrochronology makes available specimens of once-living material accurately dated to a specific year.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfrew Colin |author2=Bahn Paul |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |year=2004 |pages=144–5 |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are often represented as estimated calendar years [[before present|B.P.]], for before present, where "present" refers to 1 January 1950.&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

Timber core samples are sampled and used to measure the width of annual growth rings; by taking samples from different sites within a particular region, researchers can build a comprehensive historical sequence. The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent). In addition, some genera of trees are more suitable than others for this type of analysis. For instance, the [[bristlecone pine]] is exceptionally long-lived and slow growing, and has been used extensively for chronologies; still-living and dead specimens of this species provide tree-ring patterns going back thousands of years, in some regions more than 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |title=Bibliography of Dendrochronology |publisher=ETH Forest Snow and Landscape Research |location=Switzerland |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804005355/http://www.wsl.ch/dendro/dendrodb.html |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}{{specify|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the maximum span for fully anchored chronology is a little over 11,000 years B.P.

Dendrochronology practice faces many obstacles, including the existence of [[species]] of [[ant]]s that inhabit [[tree]]s and extend their galleries into the wood, thus destroying ring structure.

== Reference sequences ==
European chronologies derived from wooden structures initially found it difficult to bridge the gap in the 14th century when there was a building hiatus, which coincided with the [[Black Death]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Given a sample of wood, the variation of the tree-ring growths provides not only a match by year, it can also match location because the climate across a continent is not consistent. This makes it possible to determine the source of ships as well as smaller artifacts made from wood but which were transported long distances, such as panels for paintings and ship timbers.

Dates from dendrochronology can be used as a [[calibration]] and check of [[radiocarbon dating]]&lt;ref name=RenfrewBahn2004 /&gt;

=== Climatology ===
{{Main|dendroclimatology}}

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s primarily from the properties of the annual tree rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/~sheppard/Raul/DendroclimatologyReview.pdf |title=Dendroclimatology: extracting climate from trees |first=Paul R. |last=Sheppard |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.]] |journal=WIREs Clim Change  |year=May-June 2010 |volume=1 |page=343-352 |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.

=== Art history ===
[[File:Mary Queen of Scots portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, determined to date from the 16th century by dendrochronology.]]

Dendrochronology has become important to art historians in the dating of [[panel painting]]s. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf English Heritage Guide to Dendrochronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063338/http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/dendrochronology-guidelines/dendrochronology.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s have turned out to be painted on panels of "Baltic oak" shipped from the [[Vistula]] region via ports of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk, Ron, ''More than Meets the Eye: An Introduction to Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Paintings at the Fogg Art Museum'', Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 1, Autumn, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of seasoned wood were used, an uncertain number of years has to be allowed for seasoning when estimating dates.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ian Kuniholm, [http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf ''Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230735/http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2000.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }} Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; Panels were trimmed of the outer rings, and often each panel only uses a small part of the [[radius]] of the trunk. Consequently, dating studies usually result in a "[[terminus post quem]]" (earliest possible) date, and a tentative date for the actual arrival of a seasoned raw panel using assumptions as to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. Stanley |last1=Taft |first2=James W. |last2=Mayer |first3=Richard |last3=Newman |first4=Peter Ian |last4=Kuniholm |first5=Dusan |last5=Stulik |title=The Science of Paintings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98722-4 |chapter=Dendrochronology (Tree-Ring Dating) of Panel Paintings |chapterurl=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/dendro/painttex.html |pages=206–215 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422142755/https://books.google.com/books?id=L8J4Mhb1kjUC&amp;pg=PR6 |archivedate=2017-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of establishing numerous sequences, it was possible to date 85–90% of the 250 paintings from the 14th to 17th century analysed between 1971 and 1982;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, John, ''Panel Examination and Dendrochronology'' The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; by now a much greater number have been analysed.

A portrait of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] was believed to be an 18th-century copy. However, dendrochronology revealed that the wood dated from the second half of the 16th century. It is now regarded as an original 16th-century painting by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots#dendro National Portrait gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017160354/http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitConservation/mw04272/Mary-Queen-of-Scots |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dendrochronology was applied to four paintings depicting the same subject, that of [[Cleansing of the Temple|Christ expelling the money-lenders from the Temple]]. The results showed that the age of the wood was too late for any of them to have been painted by [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 Tree Rings, the barcodes of Nature illuminate art history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043013/http://www.atomium-culture.ilsole24ore.com/?p=78 |date=2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many panel paintings were transferred onto canvas or other supports during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Building history ===
The dating of buildings with wooden structures and components has also been done by using dendrochronology. While archaeologists can date wood and when it was felled, it may be difficult to definitively determine the age of a building or structure in which the wood was used; the wood could have been reused from an older structure, may have been felled and left for many years before use, or could have been used to replace a damaged piece of wood. The dating of building via dendrochronology thus requires knowledge of the history of building technology.&lt;ref name=sawyer1993&gt;{{cite book |title= Medieval Scandinavia: from conversion to Reformation, circa 800–1500 |first1= Peter |last1= Sawyer |authorlink1= Peter Sawyer (historian) |first2= Birgit |last2= Sawyer |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |series= The Nordic Series |volume= 17 |year= 1993 |page= 6 |isbn= 978-0-8166-1739-5 |oclc= 489584487 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518110748/https://books.google.de/books?id=jGJrXOjYvQgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate= 2015-05-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] in Dedham, Massachusetts. While the house had long been claimed to have been built circa 1640 (and being the oldest wood-framed house in North America), core samples of wood taken from a summer beam confirmed the wood was from an oak tree felled in 1637–8. An additional sample from another beam yielded a date of 1641, thus confirming the house had been constructed starting in 1638 and finished sometime after 1641 as wood was not seasoned before use in building at that time in New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Grand House in 17th-Century New England|url=http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|publisher=Fairbanks House Historical Site|accessdate=May 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316053504/http://www.fairbankshouse.org/the_house.html|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar seasonal patterns also occur in [[ice core]]s and in [[varve]]s (layers of [[sediment]] deposition in a lake, river, or sea bed). The deposition pattern in the core will vary for a frozen-over lake versus an ice-free lake, and with the fineness of the sediment.

Some columnar [[cactus]] also exhibit similar seasonal patterns in the isotopes of carbon and oxygen in their spines ([[acanthochronology]]). These are used for dating in a manner similar to dendrochronology, and such techniques are used in combination with dendrochronology, to plug gaps and to extend the range of the seasonal data available to archaeologists and [[paleoclimatologist]]s.

A similar technique is used to [[Estimating the age of fish|estimate the age of fish]] stocks through the analysis of growth rings in the [[otolith]] bones.

The '''Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF''' ("German Film Institute") is an institute for the study of film, based in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].

==History==
The Deutsches Filminstitut was founded on 13 April 1949 as the Deutsches Institut für Filmkunde (DIF). In 1952, the [[Deutsches Filmarchiv]] ("German Film Archive"; founded in [[Marburg]] in 1947 by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies as the Archiv für Filmwissenschaft) was set up as an autonomous department of the DIF, from which it separated again after a reorganisation in 1956.&lt;ref name=Kirchner&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirchner|first=Daniela|title=Film and Television Collections in Europe: The MAP-TV Guide|year=1995|publisher=Blueprint|location=London|isbn= 1857130154 |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1959, Lavies left the DIF and was succeeded as director by [[Max Lippmann]]. Dr Theo Fürstenau became director in 1966, and in 1981 Dr. Gerd Albrecht. The director from 1 February 1997 until September 2017 was Claudia Dillmann.

On 30 October 1999, the name was officially changed to Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF. In January 2006 the organisation merged with the [[Deutsches Filmmuseum]] ("German Film Museum"), also based in Frankfurt am Main.

==Functions==
The Deutsches Filminstitut has one of the largest film archives in Germany and one of the most comprehensive collections of material on all aspects of [[cinematography]] and [[Film|cinema]].

Current projects include:
* The edition and publication of the censorship decisions of the Berliner Film-Oberprüfstelle ("Berlin Film Inspection Point") from 1920 to 1938
* COLLATE - a collaborative system for the annotation and indexing of archive material
* [[filmportal.de]] - an internet portal for German film
* [[Filmarchives online|filmarchives-online.eu]] - union catalogue of European film archives
* EFG - The [[European Film Gateway]] - a single access point to digital collections held in European film archives and cinémathèques

The DIF is a founding member of the Deutscher Kinemathekenverbund ("German Union of Cinematheques").

[[File:Electronic Arts Intermix logo.gif||right]]
'''Electronic Arts Intermix''' ('''EAI''') is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] arts organization that is a leading international resource for [[video]] and [[media art]].  A pioneering advocate of media art and artists since 1971,  EAI's core program is the distribution and preservation of a major collection of over 3,500 new and historical video works by artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicole|first=Brigitte|title=OC Loves NY Art Book Fair: Electronic Arts Intermix|url=http://www.openingceremony.us/entry.asp?pid=2052|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 40 years, EAI has fostered the creation, exhibition, distribution and preservation of [[video art]], and more recently, digital art projects.

EAI supports artists through the distribution, preservation, exhibition and representation of their media artworks, and works closely with educators, curators, programmers and collectors to facilitate exhibitions, acquisitions and educational uses of media artworks. EAI provides access to video art within an educational and cultural framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trezzi |first=Nicola |title=Survey: Hybrid Art Spaces in New York |url=http://www.flashartonline.com/interno.php?pagina=onweb_det&amp;id_art=299&amp;det=ok&amp;titolo=SURVEY:-HYBRID-ART-SPACES-IN-NEW-YORK- |accessdate=28 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152455/http://www.flashartonline.com/interno.php?pagina=onweb_det&amp;id_art=299&amp;det=ok&amp;titolo=SURVEY%3A-HYBRID-ART-SPACES-IN-NEW-YORK- |archivedate=3 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

EAI was founded in 1971 as one of the first nonprofit organizations in the United States dedicated to the support of video as an art form. As one of the earliest organizations in the emergent video art movement, EAI was created to provide an alternative system of support for this nascent art form and the artists engaged with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Howard|title=Electronic Arts Intermix, Inc: At the Leading Edge of Art|year=1973|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Howard Wise ===

EAI was founded by Howard Wise, an art dealer and supporter of video as art. From 1960 to 1970, the Howard Wise Gallery on 57th Street in New York was a locus for [[kinetic art]] and [[multimedia artist|multimedia works]] that explored the nexus of art and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Margolies|first=John|title=TV The Next Medium|journal=Art in America|date=September–October 1969|pages=48–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery featured several groundbreaking exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samberg|first=Michael|title=Tapehead: Michael Shamberg Recounts His Journey from Renegade Video Maker to Hollywood Producer|journal=Modern Painters|date=March 2008|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including On the Move (1964), Lights in Orbit (1967), and TV as a Creative Medium (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturken|first=Marita|title=TV as a Creative Medium: Howard Wise and Video Art|journal=After Image|date=May 1974|pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to create new paradigms to support artists working in the nascent video underground, Wise closed the gallery in 1970 to found the nonprofit organization Electronic Arts Intermix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Robin|title=Video Installation: Characteristics of an Expanding Medium|journal=After Image|date=March–April 2007|volume=34|issue=5|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding mission was to support video as "a means of personal and creative expression and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Howard|title=Electronic Arts Intermix, Inc: At the Leading Edge of Art|year=1973|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editing and Post Production Facility ===

In 1972, EAI began the Editing/Post Production Facility in response to a need for a creative workspace and equipment access for artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Howard|title=What is Video Art?|journal=Cablelibraries|date=June 1977|volume=5|issue=6|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This facility was one of the first nonprofit services of its kind in the U.S., and enabled the creation of many seminal video works, by artists including [[Mary Lucier]] and [[Joan Jonas]]. The facility has served thousands of artists and organizations with low-cost access to analogue and digital technical facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturken|first=Marita|title=TV as a Creative Medium: Howard Wise and Video Art|journal=After Image|date=May 1974|pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artists' Videotape Distribution Service ===

In 1973, the Artists' Videotape Distribution Service was founded to answer a need for a new paradigm for the dissemination of artists' video works, apart from the conventional gallery system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zippay|first=Lori|title=Artists' Video: An International Guide|year=1991|publisher=Cross River Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-55859-357-8|pages=1–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists of that time were drawn to the utopian notion of a medium that was easily reproducible and therefore democratic and widely accessible. Videotapes were distributed in unlimited editions at relatively low prices. Created around a core of seminal video artists, including [[Peter Campus]], [[Juan Downey]], and [[Nam June Paik]], this service remains the oldest existing distributor of artists' video. In 1986, the EAI Preservation Program began as a way to facilitate the restoration and archiving of works in the EAI collection.

== Collection and Public Services ==

=== Collection ===

The EAI collection spans the mid-1960s to the present. The works in the collection range from seminal videos by pioneering figures — such as [[Nam June Paik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamlyn|first=Nicky|title=Magnetic Memory: A Day-Long Video Tribute to Nam June Paik|journal=Film Quarterly|year=2006|volume=60|issue=2|pages=12–16|doi=10.1525/fq.2006.60.2.12|url=http://www.research.ucreative.ac.uk/819/1/Magnetic%20Memory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Martha Rosler]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caruth |first=Nicole |title=Gastro-Vision: Martha Rosler's Kitchen Mise-en-Sceene |url=http://magazine.art21.org/2011/01/21/gastro-vision-martha-roslers-kitchen-mise-en-scene/ |publisher=art:21 |accessdate=28 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Joan Jonas]] — to new digital works by emerging artists, including [[Seth Price]], [[Paper Rad]], [[Cory Arcangel]] and Takeshi Murata.  Through EAI's Artists Media Distribution Service, the collection is made available for screenings, exhibitions and acquisitions to museums, collectors, and educational, arts and cultural institutions.

In September 2011 an exhibition commemorating the 40th anniversary of Electronic Arts Intermix, Circa 1971: Early Video and Film from the EAI Archive, opened at [[Dia:Beacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Benjamin|title=Early Video &amp; Film from the EAI Archive at Dia:Beacon|url=http://www.openingceremony.us/entry.asp?pid=4352|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition, curated by current EAI Executive Director Lori Zippay, featured early video works by [[Joan Jonas]], [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Arts Intermix Circa 1971: Early Video &amp; Film from the EAI Archive |url=http://www.diaart.org/exhibitions/pressrelease/118 |publisher=Dia Art Foundation |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014220042/http://diaart.org/exhibitions/pressrelease/118 |archivedate=October 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Resources ===

'''''EuroTrump''''' is a 90-minute long documentary, which follows [[Geert Wilders]]' campaign for Prime Minister of the Netherlands during the [[Dutch general election, 2017]] and compares him to the U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. It was directed by [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]], and co-written by Morse and [[Maria Spinger]]. 

== Background and production ==
Geert Wilders, a right-wing politician in the [[Netherlands]], decided to run for [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2017]]. Stephen Robert Morse was fascinated by this, particularly after American politician [[Donald Trump]]'s successful presidential election and the [[United Kingdom]] leaving the [[European Union]]. He, along with Nick Hampson and Maria Springer, decided to make a documentary which follows Wilders campaign, and compares him to Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/news/eurotrump-documentary-mba-alumni-airs-tv|title=EuroTrump documentary by MBA alumni airs on TV|work=Oxford University Saïd Business School|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wilders’ was the first big election in the world after Trump, which is what drew us to the project in the first place. We wanted to make a movie about an election that involved an outsider, someone from the traditional right wing," Hampson said.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Kelsey |title='EUROTRUMP' Documentary Provides Inside Look at Geert Wilders |url=https://observer.com/2017/10/documentary-eurotrump-provides-inside-look-at-geert-wilders/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Observer]] |publisher=Joseph Meyer |date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Robert Morse]] and [[Nick Hampson]] co-directed the documentary, and [[Maria Spinger]] co-wrote it. The soundtrack was composed by Harry Davidson, a music scholar from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt;

The filming began in December 2016, a couple of days after a trial where Wilders was convicted of hate speech, which concluded with the judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, deciding that the court would not impose any punishment on Wilders following the trial.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Persio |first1=Sofia Lotto |title=Is Geert Wilders Really The Dutch Donald?

The Dutch press were not supportive of the documentary; however, Morse stated, "I think that’s an ignorant approach. You should try understand the people who disagree with. If you don't have an in-depth understanding of someone it makes it very challenging to understand their viewpoint, if you don't understand where those views came from."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse stated that throughout the whole production time span, the production team applied the lessons they learned at the [[Saïd Business School]].&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; Morse thought that even though Wilders' had such strong beliefs politically,  he was a likeable person; at their first meeting for the documentary, Wilders' and Morse made each other laugh often, despite Morse expecting Wilders' to be "a monster."&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

The documentary follows Wilders' campaign and provides an up-close view of him, discussing what his ideas are politically, including clearing Islam from the [[Netherlands]] and shutting down all [[mosques]],&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; as well as providing information about himself, such as talking about his two cats and describing himself as a "spoilt child."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; The documentary also discusses how Wilders' constantly has strict security around him, and how it affects him.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; Morse describes the comparison between Wilders and Trump as ironic, due to how little they have in common.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Morse thought that his work producing ''[[Amanda Knox]]'' allowed Wilders to trust him more; many journalists would have a much more difficult time getting up-close to Wilders.&lt;ref name="sbs"/&gt; The show premiered on [[Hulu]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cohn |first1=Gabe |title=What’s on TV Monday: ‘The Rape of Recy Taylor’ and ‘Strangers’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/arts/television/whats-on-tv-monday-the-rape-of-recy-taylor-and-strangers.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[A.G.

{{About|the type of media content}}
'''Fiction''' broadly refers to any [[narrative]] that is derived from the [[imagination]]—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiction fiction]." Merriam-Webster, Incorporated. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sageng, Fossheim, &amp; Larsen (eds.) (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=events+places The Philosophy of Computer Games]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"&gt;William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition).  New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the [[novel]] and [[short story]]), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;M. h. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels, but it may also denote any "[[literature|literary]] narrative" (see [[literary fiction]]),&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition). Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fiction Definition of 'fiction']." ''Oxford English Dictionaries'' (online). Oxford University Press. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[novel]]s, [[novella]]s, and [[short story|short stories]]. More broadly, fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format, including [[writing]]s, [[drama|theatrical performances]], [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[animation]]s, games (most notably, [[video game]]s and [[role-playing game]]s), and so on.

A work of fiction implies the inventive act of [[worldbuilding|constructing an imaginary world]], so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only [[character (arts)|characters]] who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true.&lt;ref name="litfiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farner|first=Geir|year=2014|title=Literary Fiction: The Ways We Read Narrative Literature|chapter=Chapter 2: What is Literary Fiction?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXXHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the context of fiction, generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world, is more open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction|quote=Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity. The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about. Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary [i.e. fictional] works as a function they are given by interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent [[fictional universe]].

Fiction's traditional opposite is [[non-fiction]], a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements, such as [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Iftekharuddin, Frahat (ed.). (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61w4hxtXnFUC&amp;dq The Postmodern Short Story: Forms and Issues]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of fictional genres}}

Traditionally, fiction includes [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[fables]], [[legend]]s, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[narrative poetry]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] (including [[operas]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[drama]]s, [[puppet play]]s, and [[concert dance|various kinds of theatrical dances]]). However, fiction may also encompass [[comic book]]s, and many [[animated cartoon]]s, [[stop motion]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[fictional film|films]], [[video games]], [[radio drama|radio programs]], [[television program]]s ([[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), etc.

The [[Internet]] has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of [[copyright]] as a means to ensure [[royalties]] are paid to copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Oliver. (2015). "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/09/why-it-is-crucial-that-the-publishing-industry-embrace-fan-fiction.html Why Fan Fiction is the Future of Publishing]."
''The Daily Beast''. The Daily Beast Company LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[digital libraries]] such as [[Project Gutenberg]] make [[public domain]] texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive [[computer game]]s or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for [[fan fiction]] can be found online, where loyal followers of specific [[fictional realm]]s create and distribute derivative stories. The Internet is also used for the development of [[blog fiction]], where a story is delivered through a [[blog]] either as flash fiction or serial [[blog]], and [[collaborative fiction]], where a story is written sequentially by different authors, or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a [[wiki]].

Types of [[literary fiction]] in [[prose]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Milhorn, H. Thomas. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1AM825Ny4v0C&amp;pg Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft]''. Universal Publishers: Boca Raton. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Short story]]: A work of at least 2,000 words but under 7,500 words. The boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (1992). London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novella]]: A work of at least 7,500 words but under 50,000 words. [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) is an example of a [[novella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novel]]: A work of 50,000 words or more.

== Genre fiction ==
{{main|Genre fiction}}

Fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of [[list of fictional genres|genres]]: subsets of fiction, each differentiated by a particular unifying [[Tone (literature)|tone or style]], [[literary technique#literary techniques|narrative technique]], [[content (media)|media content]], or popularly defined criterion. [[Science fiction]], for example, predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]] first land on the moon.

[[Historical fiction]] places imaginary characters into real historical events. In the early historical novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s fictional character Edward Waverley meets a figure from history, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and takes part in the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. Some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story, or a reconstructed biography.&lt;ref name="The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies"/&gt; Often, even when the fictional story is based on fact, there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting. An example is Tim O'Brien's ''[[The Things They Carried]]'', a series of [[short stories]] about the [[Vietnam War]].

Fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural, magical, or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of [[fantasy]], including [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice In Wonderland]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"/&gt;

==Literary fiction==
{{main|Literature|Literary fiction}}

[[Literary fiction]] is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having [[literary merit]], from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].

[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, he suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from 20 October 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', he argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from 14 June 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fiction often involves [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}} In general it focuses on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|pp=181–82}} Usually in literary fiction the focus is on the "inner story" of the characters who drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}} The [[Style (fiction)|style]] of literary fiction is often described as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}} The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}

== Realism{{anchor|Reality_and_fiction}} ==
{{See also|Literary realism}}

Realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic [[setting (narrative)|setting]] (time and location in the world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely [[wikt:alternate universe|imaginary universe]], an [[alternative history]] of the world other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting [[impossible technology]] or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.{{refn|group=note|As philosopher Stacie Friend explains, "in reading we take works of fiction, like works of non-fiction, to be about the real world—even if they invite us to imagine the world to be different from how it actually is. [Thus], imagining a storyworld does not mean directing one's imagining toward something other than the real world; it is instead a mental activity that involves constructing a complex representation of what a story portrays".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Friend |first=Stacie |year=2017 |title=The Real Foundation of Fictional Worlds |url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/13997/1/13997.pdf |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=95 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|The research of Weisberg and Goodstein (2009) revealed that, despite not being specifically informed that, say, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, had two legs, their subjects "consistently assumed that some real-world facts obtained in fiction, although they were sensitive to the kind of fact and the realism of the story."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deena_Weisberg/publication/233656603_What_Belongs_in_a_Fictional_World/links/54aadcd90cf2ce2df668ca52.pdf Weisberg, D.S. &amp; Goodstein, J., "What Belongs in a Fictional World?", ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', Vol. 9, No. 1, (March 2009), pp. 69–78.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of the traditional separation between fiction and [[non-fiction]], the lines are now commonly understood as blurred, showing more overlap than mutual exclusion. Even fiction usually has elements of, or grounding in, truth. The distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience, according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people, places, and events are all historically or factually real, while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], argues that "fiction is both artifice and [[verisimilitude (narrative)|verisimilitude]]", meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James. 2008. ''How Fiction Works.'' New York. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; a notion often encapsulated in poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s term: [[willing suspension of disbelief]]. Also, infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality, provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.&lt;ref name="subversive"/&gt;

Located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the '''Fund for the Arts''' is the oldest united arts fund in the country and has raised over $172 million since its establishment. Mayor [[Charles R. Farnsley]], served as [[Mayor]] of the City of Louisville from 1948 to 1953, and first conceived of the Fund for the Arts in 1949. He based its structure on that of the [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], now known as [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090806065755/http://www.ket.org/cgi-bin/fw_louisvillelife.exe/db/ket/dmps/Programs?do=topic&amp;topicid=LOUL110076&amp;id=LOUL KET Charles P. Farnsley, Politician and Champion for the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 campaign raised more than $7.3 million, a long way from its first campaign in 1949, of $99,000. The Fund currently provides financing, facilities and administrative support for twenty-nine [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] area arts groups and programs. In addition, it awards over 200 community access grants annually to community groups and schools in [[Kentucky]] and Southern [[Indiana]]. Other Fund sponsored activities include the annual Whittenberg Young Artist Scholarship. Conceived of and directed by the Fund for the Arts, [[ArtSpace Louisville|ArtSpace]], the W.L. Lyons [[Brown Theatre]] and the Fifth Third Conference Center are owned by the Fund for the Arts Properties Foundation, Inc., a Fund for the Arts partner corporation. 

For 35 years, the Fund for the Arts was headed by President and CEO, Allan Cowen, who retired in 2012. Barbara Sexton Smith, was named President and CEO in April 2012 and announced her retirement as of June, 2014.

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

=== Illustrator ===
[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

'''Guerrilla art''' is a [[street art]] [[art movement|movement]] that first emerged in the [[UK]], but has since spread across the world and is now established in most countries that already had developed [[graffiti]] scenes. In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the [[United States]] guerrilla art is still referred to as ‘post-graffiti art’.
  
Guerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece's meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to ‘art for arts sake’ and would be defined by ''what it is'' as opposed to ''what it does''.

The production of [[guerrilla]] art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.

== Guerrilla artists ==
Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce ‘trapped art’, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be [[mass produced]] with little fidelity and put up with [[wheat paste]]. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with [[D*Face]]'s hijacking of the [[Walt Disney]] signature.

It's not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public's artistic response to it.

&lt;!-- 'Vacant Lot Of Cabbages' (1978) --&gt;
&lt;!-- http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives/ --&gt;

In 1978 in downtown Wellington, [[New Zealand]] artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages "on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested."&lt;ref name="wellington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harper |first1=Jenny |first2=Aaron |last2=Lister |date= |title=Wellington: A City for Sculpture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWhH1fjliCwC&amp;q=barry+thomas#v=snippet&amp;q=barry%20thomas&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of Guerrilla art and [[guerilla gardening]] in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." &lt;ref&gt;"The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White"&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Barton writes in the following months, "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers".&lt;ref name="wellington" /&gt; Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" with links to the "[[Occupy movement]], [[urban farming]] and [[guerrilla gardening]]".&lt;ref&gt;"‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic movement ==
[[Art]]istic [[Art movement|movement]]s are responsive. This movement is a response to the ever-increasing power and importance of the brand in everyday life. Developed, inner-city environments are where both [[brand]]ing and guerrilla art flourish. This is not coincidental.

The most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of [[guerrilla marketing]] methods to create ‘artistic publicity’ has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands.

It is this branding and the profound effect it has upon the minds of the general public that drives the guerrilla art movement.

{{Quantum field theory}}
In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], the '''Brout-Englert-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism''' is essential to explain the [[mass generation mechanism|generation mechanism]] of the property "[[mass]]" for [[gauge bosons]]. Without the Higgs mechanism, all [[boson]]s (one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions) would be considered [[Massless particle|massless]], but measurements show that the [[W boson|W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[Z boson]]s actually have relatively large masses of around 80&amp;nbsp;GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a [[quantum field]] (the [[Higgs boson|Higgs field]]) that permeates all space, to the Standard Model. Below some extremely high temperature, the field causes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons it interacts with to have mass. In the [[Standard Model]], the phrase "Higgs mechanism" refers specifically to the generation of masses for the [[W and Z bosons|W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;, and Z]] [[Weak force|weak]] gauge bosons through [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] symmetry breaking.&lt;ref name=PDG&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bernardi, G. |author2=Carena, M. |author3=Junk, T. |title=Higgs bosons: Theory and searches |publisher=Particle Data Group |series=Review: Hypothetical particles and Concepts |year=2007 |url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/higgs_s055.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14&amp;nbsp;March 2013, making it extremely likely that the field, or one like it, exists, and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature.

== Standard model ==
The Higgs mechanism was incorporated into modern particle physics by [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]], and is an essential part of the [[standard model]].

In the standard model, at temperatures high enough that electroweak symmetry is unbroken, all elementary particles are massless. At a critical temperature, the Higgs field becomes [[tachyonic field|tachyonic]]; the symmetry is spontaneously broken by [[tachyon condensation|condensation]], and the [[W and Z bosons]] acquire masses (also called “electroweak symmetry breaking”, or ''EWSB''.)

Fermions, such as the [[lepton]]s and [[quark]]s in the Standard Model, can also acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons.

=== Structure of the Higgs field ===
In the standard model, the Higgs field is an [[Special unitary group|'''SU'''(2)]] doublet (i.e. the standard representation with two complex components called isospin), which is a [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] under Lorentz transformations. Its electric charge is zero; its [[weak isospin]] is {{frac|1|2}}; its [[weak hypercharge]] (the charge for the '''U'''(1) gauge group) is 1&amp;nbsp;. Under '''U'''(1) rotations, it is multiplied by a phase, which thus mixes the real and imaginary parts of the complex spinor into each other, combining to the standard two-component complex representation of the group '''U'''(2).

The Higgs field, through the interactions specified (summarized, represented, or even simulated) by its potential, induces spontaneous breaking of three out of the four generators ("directions") of the gauge group '''U'''(2). This is often written as '''SU'''(2) × '''U'''(1), (which is strictly speaking only the same on the level of infinitesimal symmetries) because the diagonal phase factor also acts on other fields – [[quark]]s in particular. Three out of its four components would ordinarily resolve as [[Goldstone boson]]s, if they were not coupled to gauge fields.

However, after symmetry breaking, these three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the three [[W and Z boson]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}}), and are only observable as components of these [[weak boson]]s, which are made massive by their inclusion; only the single remaining degree of freedom becomes a new scalar particle: the [[Higgs boson]].

=== The photon as the part that remains massless ===
The gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is '''SU'''(2)&amp;nbsp;× '''U'''(1). The group '''SU'''(2) is the group of all 2-by-2 unitary matrices with unit determinant; all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space.

Rotating the coordinates so that the second basis vector points in the direction of the Higgs boson makes the [[vacuum expectation value]] of ''H'' the spinor (0,&amp;nbsp;''v''). The generators for rotations about the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes are by half the Pauli matrices ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that a rotation of angle ''θ'' about the ''z''-axis takes the vacuum to
::&lt;math&gt; \left(0, v e^{-\frac{1}{2}i\theta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

While the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; generators mix up the top and bottom components of the spinor, the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; rotations only multiply each by opposite phases. This phase can be undone by a '''U'''(1) rotation of angle {{sfrac|1|2}}''θ''. Consequently, under both an '''SU'''(2) ''T''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;-rotation and a '''U'''(1) rotation by an amount {{sfrac|1|2}}''θ'', ''the vacuum is invariant''.

This combination of generators
::&lt;math&gt; Q = T_z + \frac{1}{2}Y&lt;/math&gt;

defines the unbroken part of the gauge group, where ''Q'' is the electric charge, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is the generator of rotations around the z-axis in the '''SU'''(2) and ''Y'' is the hypercharge generator of the '''U'''(1). This combination of generators (a ''z'' rotation in the '''SU'''(2) and a simultaneous '''U'''(1) rotation by half the angle) preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model, namely ''the electric charge'' group. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and amounts to the physical photon.

=== Consequences for fermions ===

In spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass terms preclude chiral gauge invariance. For these fields, the mass terms should always be replaced by a gauge-invariant "Higgs" mechanism. One possibility is some kind of ''[[Yukawa coupling]]'' (see below) between the fermion field ''ψ'' and the Higgs field Φ, with unknown couplings ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''ψ''&lt;/sub&gt;, which after symmetry breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e., by introduction of the Higgs field) written in a gauge-invariant way. The Lagrange density for the Yukawa interaction of a fermion field ''ψ'' and the Higgs field Φ is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Fermion}}(\phi, A, \psi) = \overline{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu} \psi + G_{\psi} \overline{\psi} \phi \psi,&lt;/math&gt;

where again the gauge field ''A'' only enters ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[Dirac matrices]], and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''ψ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the already-mentioned Yukawa coupling parameter. Now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value &lt;math&gt;|\langle\phi\rangle |&lt;/math&gt;. Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property ''mass''.

== History of research ==

=== Background ===
[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]] offered a framework to introduce bosons into relativistic quantum field theories. However, according to [[Goldstone's theorem]], these bosons should be massless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/EP/guralnik_ap_2_567_67.pdf |author1=Guralnik, G S |author2=Hagen, C R |author3=Kibble, T W B |year=1967 |title=Broken symmetries and the Goldstone theorem |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only observed particles which could be approximately interpreted as Goldstone bosons were the [[pion]]s, which [[Yoichiro Nambu]] related to [[chiral symmetry]] breaking.

A similar problem arises with [[Yang–Mills theory]] (also known as [[non-Abelian gauge theory]]), which predicts massless [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-1 [[gauge boson]]s. Massless weakly-interacting gauge bosons lead to long-range forces, which are only observed for electromagnetism and the corresponding massless [[photon]]. Gauge theories of the [[weak force]] needed a way to describe massive gauge bosons in order to be consistent.

That breaking gauge symmetries did not lead to massless particles was observed in 1961 by [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Julian |last=Schwinger |year=1961 |title=Gauge invariance and mass |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=397–8 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.125.397 |bibcode=1962PhRv..125..397S}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he did not demonstrate massive particles would eventuate. This was done  in [[Philip Warren Anderson]]'s 1962 paper&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; but only in non-relativistic field theory; it also discussed consequences for particle physics but did not work out an explicit relativistic model. The relativistic model was developed in 1964 by three independent groups:

However, their paper was delayed by the editorial office of [[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics|JETP]], and was published late, in 1966.

The mechanism is closely analogous to phenomena previously discovered by [[Yoichiro Nambu]] involving the "vacuum structure" of quantum fields in [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Y |year=1960 |title=Quasi-particles and gauge invariance in the theory of superconductivity |journal=Physical Review |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=648–663 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.117.648 |bibcode=1960PhRv..117..648N}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar but distinct effect (involving an affine realization of what is now recognized as the Higgs field), known as the [[Stueckelberg action|Stueckelberg mechanism]], had previously been studied by [[Ernst Stueckelberg]].

These physicists discovered that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry group, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a nonzero mass. In spite of the large values involved (see below) this permits a gauge theory description of the weak force, which was independently developed by [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]] in 1967. Higgs's original article presenting the model was rejected by [[Physics Letters]]. When revising the article before resubmitting it to [[Physical Review Letters]], he added a sentence at the end,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Higgs |year=2007 |title=Prehistory of the Higgs boson |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=970–972 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2006.12.006 |bibcode=2007CRPhy...8..970H}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning that it implies the existence of one or more new, massive scalar bosons, which do not form complete [[group representation|representations]] of the symmetry group; these are the Higgs bosons.

The three papers by Brout and Englert; Higgs; and Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble were each recognized as "milestone letters" by ''Physical Review Letters'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://prl.aps.org/50years/milestones#1964 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=50th anniversary milestone papers |access-date=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While each of these seminal papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences among the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] are noteworthy. All six physicists were jointly awarded the 2010 [[Sakurai Prize|J. J.

[[Benjamin W.

== Examples ==
The Higgs mechanism occurs whenever a charged field has a vacuum expectation value. In the nonrelativistic context, this is the Landau model of a charged Bose–Einstein condensate, also known as a superconductor. In the relativistic condensate, the condensate is a scalar field, and is relativistically invariant.

=== Landau model ===
The Higgs mechanism is a type of [[superconductivity]] which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or, in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does in a superconducting medium; e.g., in the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]]).

A superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the [[Meissner effect]]. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior. But magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a magnetic monopole (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them. The Meissner effect is due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose thickness, the [[London penetration depth]], can be calculated from a simple model
(the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]]).

This simple model treats superconductivity as a charged [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Suppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge ''q''. The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a [[quantum field theory|quantum field]], ''ψ'', which obeys the [[Schrödinger field|Schrödinger equation as a field equation]] (in units where the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''ħ'', is set to 1):

:&lt;math&gt;i{\partial \over \partial t} \psi = {(\nabla - iqA)^2 \over 2m} \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ''ψ''(''x'') annihilates a boson at the point ''x'', while its adjoint ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose–Einstein condensate is then the [[expectation value]] ''ψ'' of ''ψ''(''x''), which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.

When there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a [[gauge transformation]] on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \psi &amp;\rightarrow e^{iq\phi(x)} \psi \\
    A &amp;\rightarrow A + \nabla \phi.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of ''ψ'' at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.

The condensate wave function can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \rho(x)\, e^{i\theta(x)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of ''θ'', the direction in which the phase of the Schrödinger field changes. If the phase ''θ'' changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now ''θ'' can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.

The energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schrödinger kinetic energy,

:&lt;math&gt;H = {1 \over 2m} \left|(qA + \nabla)\psi\right|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

and taking the density of the condensate ''ρ'' to be constant,

:&lt;math&gt;H \approx {\rho^2 \over 2m} (qA + \nabla \theta)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

Fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,

:&lt;math&gt;{q^2 \rho^2 \over 2m} A^2.&lt;/math&gt;

When this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength ''A'' mode,

:&lt;math&gt; E \approx {{\dot A}^2\over 2} + {q^2 \rho^2 \over 2m} A^2. &lt;/math&gt;

This is a harmonic oscillator with frequency

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{m} q^2 \rho^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{abs|''ψ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= ''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the density of the condensate of superconducting particles.

In an actual superconductor, the charged particles are electrons, which are fermions not bosons. So in order to have superconductivity, the electrons need to somehow bind into [[Cooper pair]]s. The charge of the condensate ''q'' is therefore twice the electron charge −''e''. The pairing in a normal superconductor is due to lattice vibrations, and is in fact very weak; this means that the pairs are very loosely bound. The description of a Bose–Einstein condensate of loosely bound pairs is actually more difficult than the description of a condensate of elementary particles, and was only worked out in 1957 by [[BCS theory|Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer]] in the famous BCS theory.

=== Abelian Higgs mechanism&lt;!--'Higgs potential' redirects here--&gt; ===
Gauge invariance means that certain transformations of the gauge field do not change the energy at all. If an arbitrary gradient is added to ''A'', the energy of the field is exactly the same. This makes it difficult to add a mass term, because a mass term tends to push the field toward the value zero. But the zero value of the vector potential is not a gauge invariant idea. What is zero in one gauge is nonzero in another.

So in order to give mass to a gauge theory, the gauge invariance must be broken by a condensate. The condensate will then define a preferred phase, and the phase of the condensate will define the zero value of the field in a gauge-invariant way. The gauge-invariant definition is that a gauge field is zero when the phase change along any path from parallel transport is equal to the phase difference in the condensate wavefunction.

The condensate value is described by a quantum field with an expectation value, just as in the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|Ginzburg-Landau model]].

In order for the phase of the vacuum to define a gauge, the field must have a phase (also referred to as 'to be charged'). In order for a scalar field Φ to have a phase, it must be complex, or (equivalently) it should contain two fields with a symmetry which rotates them into each other. The vector potential changes the phase of the quanta produced by the field when they move from point to point. In terms of fields, it defines how much to rotate the real and imaginary parts of the fields into each other when comparing field values at nearby points.

The only [[renormalization|renormalizable]] model where a complex scalar field Φ acquires a nonzero value is the Mexican-hat model, where the field energy has a minimum away from zero. The action for this model is
:&lt;math&gt;S(\phi) = \int \frac{1}{2} \left|\partial \phi\right|^2 - \lambda \left(\left|\phi\right|^2 - \Phi^2\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which results in the Hamiltonian
:&lt;math&gt;H(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} \left|\dot\phi\right|^2 + \left|\nabla \phi\right|^2 + V(\left|\phi\right|).&lt;/math&gt;
The first term is the kinetic energy of the field. The second term is the extra potential energy when the field varies from point to point. The third term is the potential energy when the field has any given magnitude.

This potential energy, the '''Higgs potential'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, ''V''(''z'', Φ) = λ(|''z''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − Φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1007/BF02812722 | title = Field theories with " Superconductor " solutions | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–164 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1961NCim...19..154G | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/343400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a graph which looks like a [[Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat]], which gives the model its name. In particular, the minimum energy value is not at ''z'' = 0, but on the circle of points where the magnitude of ''z'' is Φ.

[[Image:Mecanismo de Higgs PH.png|thumb|Higgs potential ''V''. For a fixed value of λ, the potential is presented upwards against the real and imaginary parts of Φ. The ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground should be noted.]]

When the field Φ(''x'') is not coupled to electromagnetism, the Mexican-hat potential has flat directions. Starting in any one of the circle of vacua and changing the phase of the field from point to point costs very little energy. Mathematically, if
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) = \Phi e^{i\theta(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
with a constant prefactor, then the action for the field ''θ''(''x''), i.e., the "phase" of the Higgs field Φ(x), has only derivative terms. This is not a surprise. Adding a constant to ''θ''(''x'') is a symmetry of the original theory, so different values of ''θ''(''x'') cannot have different energies. This is an example of [[Goldstone's theorem]]: spontaneously broken continuous symmetries normally produce massless excitations.

The Abelian Higgs model is the Mexican-hat model coupled to [[Maxwell's theory|electromagnetism]]:
:&lt;math&gt;S(\phi, A) = \int - \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} + \left|\left(\partial - i q A\right)\phi\right|^2 - \lambda \left(\left|\phi\right|^2 - \Phi^2\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The classical vacuum is again at the minimum of the potential, where the magnitude of the complex field ''φ'' is equal to Φ. But now the phase of the field is arbitrary, because gauge transformations change it. This means that the field ''θ''(''x'') can be set to zero by a gauge transformation, and does not represent any actual degrees of freedom at all.

Furthermore, choosing a gauge where the phase of the vacuum is fixed, the potential energy for fluctuations of the vector field is nonzero. So in the Abelian Higgs model, the gauge field acquires a mass. To calculate the magnitude of the mass, consider a constant value of the vector potential ''A'' in the ''x''-direction in the gauge where the condensate has constant phase. This is the same as a sinusoidally varying condensate in the gauge where the vector potential is zero. In the gauge where A is zero, the potential energy density in the condensate is the scalar gradient energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} \left|\partial \left(\Phi e^{iqAx} \right) \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2} q^2\Phi^2 A^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This energy is the same as a mass term {{sfrac|1|2}}''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''m''&amp;nbsp;= ''q''Φ.

=== Non-Abelian Higgs mechanism ===
The Non-Abelian Higgs model has the following action

:&lt;math&gt;S(\phi,\mathbf A) = \int {1\over 4g^2} \mathop{\textrm{tr}}(F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) + |D\phi|^2 + V(|\phi|)&lt;/math&gt;

where now the non-Abelian field '''A''' is contained in the covariant derivative ''D'' and in the tensor components &lt;math&gt;F^{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; (the relation between '''A''' and those components is well-known from the [[Yang–Mills theory]]).

It is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field ''φ'' is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.

:&lt;math&gt;D\phi = \partial \phi - i A^k t_k \phi&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the expectation value of Φ defines a preferred gauge where the vacuum is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field A come with a nonzero energy cost.

Depending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this model, the gauge group is '''SO'''(3) (or '''SU'''(2) − there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to '''U'''(1) or '''SO'''(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of '''SO'''(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the ''z''-axis in field space to be the direction that ''φ'' is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of ''φ'' is {{nowrap|(0, 0, ''A'')}}, where ''A'' is a constant with dimensions of mass (&lt;math&gt;c = \hbar = 1&lt;/math&gt;).

Rotations around the ''z''-axis form a '''U'''(1) subgroup of '''SO'''(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of ''φ'', and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the ''x'' and ''y''-axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the '''SO'''(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale ''A'', and one massless '''U'''(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.

The Schwinger model predicts [[magnetic monopoles]] at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z meson. It doesn't break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.

=== Affine Higgs mechanism ===
[[Ernst Stueckelberg]] discovered&lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, E. C. G. (1938), "Die Wechselwirkungskräfte in der Elektrodynamik und in der Feldtheorie der Kräfte", ''Helv. Phys. Acta.'' '''11:''' 225&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Effectively, [[Stueckelberg action|Stueckelberg's model]] is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value ''H'' goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to ''H'', so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and decouples, so is not present in the discussion. The vector meson mass, however, equals to the product ''eH'', and stays finite.

The interpretation is that when a '''U'''(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field ''θ'' has the following gauge transformation law:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \theta &amp;\rightarrow \theta + e\alpha\,\\
       A &amp;\rightarrow A + \partial \alpha.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:
:&lt;math&gt; D\theta = \partial \theta - e A H.\,&lt;/math&gt;

In order to keep ''θ'' fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, ''θ'' should be rescaled by H, so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting &lt;math&gt;\phi = H e^{i\theta/H}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; S = \int \tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(D\theta)^2 = \int \tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial \theta - He A)^2 = \int \tfrac{1}{4}F^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial \theta - m A)^2&lt;/math&gt;

since ''eH'' is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set {{nowrap|1=''θ'' = 0}}, the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:

:&lt;math&gt; S= \int \tfrac{1}{4} F^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m^2 A^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

To have arbitrarily small charges requires that the '''U'''(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers '''R''' under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a '''U'''(1) group is ''non-compact''. The field ''θ'' transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact '''U'''(1) admits affine representations, and the '''U'''(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.

The Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but [[magnetic monopole]]s are not allowed. For non-Abelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.

A '''Hollander beater''' is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce [[paper]] pulp from cellulose containing plant fibers.  It replaced [[stamp mill]]s for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.gif|Hollander beater patent|thumb]]

However, the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer, more easily hydrated, and more fibrillated cellulose fibers; thus increasing the resulting paper's strength. The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material, resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper. Further, the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another. These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called [[foxing]].&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

In turn, the Hollander was (partially) replaced by the [[conical refiner]] or Jordan refiner, named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan, who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.jpg|A Hollander beater|thumb]]

A Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate,&lt;ref name=lumiainen2000refining&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4: Refining of chemical pulp|last1=Lumiainen|first1=J|title=Papermaking Part 1|isbn=952521608X|page=98|date=2000|url=http://www.fing.edu.uy/iiq/maestrias/icp/materiales/2010/06_Papermaking/book8chapter4refining%20of%20chemical%20pulp.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- full book table of contents: http://www.tappi.org/oldtappi/content/pdf/bookstore/0202fin08.pdf --&gt; similar to the construction of a [[water wheel]] or timing pulley. Under power, the blades &lt;!-- "blades" would generally denote cutting not beating--&gt; rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry.  The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers  when passing through the beater.

The objective of using a beater (rather than another process like grinding, as many [[Wood pulp#Manufacture of wood pulp|wood-pulp]] mills do) is to create longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for [[hydrogen bond]]ing). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the "blades" are not what might be thought of as "sharpened," and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.&lt;!-- this statement can be eliminated by replacing the word blades, with a more accurate description --&gt;

'''Jan Moninckx''' (c1656 [[Leende]] - buried 20 May 1714 [[Amsterdam]]), was a Dutch botanical artist and painter, best known for the colour plates he and his daughter, [[Maria Moninckx]], created and which make up the nine-volume ''Moninckx Atlas''. This was published in the period 1686-1709 and depicted 420 plants from the ''Hortus Medicus'' of Amsterdam.

==Hortus Medicus==
In 1682 [[Joan Huydecoper II|Joan Huydecoper]] and [[Jan Commelin]] took the initiative in establishing a new ''Hortus Medicus'' in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a ''Hortus Botanicus''. Huydecoper was mayor of Amsterdam and had great influence with the [[Dutch East India Company]], while Commelin was a merchant in herbs and pharmaceuticals. Both men were well known as enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardeners. Because of their contacts in the businessworld and their practical horticultural experience, they received a constant stream of plants, seeds, bulbs and cuttings to be cultivated far from their place of origin. 

This led to the creation of one of the richest plant collections in Europe. Plants of commercial value, also potherbs, edible crop plants and medicinal plants, were propagated in the garden for planting elsewhere. An example of this was the coffee plant, which oddly, was not illustrated in the ''Moninckx Atlas'', but became the backbone of the Brazilian coffee industry. In addition many ornamental plants, especially strange and exotic specimens, were cultivated. These plants were grown for their interest, curiosity value and often for further research.

==Moninckx Atlas==
Between 1686 and 1709, Huydecoper and Commelin commissioned 420 large parchment [[aquarel]]s of plants growing in the Amsterdam garden. The garden did not have a [[herbarium]], and a pictorial record in the form of paintings, would create something of permanent value.

Four very accomplished artists were employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. [[Maria Moninckx]], his daughter, produced 101 paintings. The other artists were [[Alida Withoos]] (13 aquarels) and [[Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff]] (daughter of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]) with 2 sheets; 31 aquarels were unsigned. The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there was an attempt to expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock. The illustrated plants in the first five volumes and part of the sixth, had their names printed in both Latin and Dutch. The Latin names in bold Roman type, and the Dutch names in elegant Gothic calligraphy.

This monumental work is still of great taxonomic, historic, and artistic interest. The aquarels have served as the basis for engravings in the ''Horti Medici Amstelodamensis rariorum plantarum historia'', part 1, by Jan Commelin, appearing in 1697 and part 2, by his cousin Caspar Commelin, in 1701. The famed botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] based the taxonomy for his ''Species plantarum'' of 1753 on no fewer than 259 species from the ''Moninckx Atlas''. A recent scanning of the complete work has made the plates and text available on the [http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?c=botanie;page=index;sid=d44a711aecd3e8dca7c341e56be383e1;tpl=p_moninckx.tpl;corig=botanie;start=1 University of Amsterdam] website.

==Moninckx family==
The Moninckx family had a long tradition of painting and were researched in a book titled ''De Schildersfamilie Moninckx'', published by [[Abraham Bredius]] in 1889. Well-known was Gijsbert Moninckx, a member of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in [[The Hague]] in 1605.

Jan's parents were Johannes Moninckx, a clergyman at [[Leende]], [[Noord-Brabant]], and his wife, Maria Jan van Duysel.
On 23 May 1682 Jan signed a betrothal register in Amsterdam, stating his intention to marry Anna Geestevelt. Anna was 23 years old and both lived at [[Singel (Amsterdam)|Het Singel]] in Amsterdam. In 1686 Jan was lieutenant in a military guard.

In 1698 Jan signed a notarial document authorising the sale of a house at [[Voorburg]] that had belonged to his deceased father-in-law. At that time he lived in Leydsedwarsstraat in Amsterdam and was married to Adriaentje Uchtenbroeck, whose father had been Pieter Jans Uchtenbroeck. Jan was buried on 20 May 1714 and had died at his house in Noorderdwarsstraat near the [[Prinsengracht#Prinsengracht|Prinsengracht]]. Adriaentje was buried on 27 January 1722.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''Kinechromatic art''' is a form of art in which the image, particularly in reference to the colour perceived by the viewer, changes due to some form of movement.

The term "kinechromatic" was coined in 1951 by [[Mario Pedrosa]] in an article in ''[[Tribuna da Imprensa]]'' to refer to the work of Brazilian artist, [[Abraham Palatnik]]. Palatnik initially created [[electro-mechanical]] devices, based on the [[kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] principle, which projected a constantly changing pattern of coloured light on a screen. Later devices exposed coloured moving parts of the machinery. In all cases, the shape and colour observed were changed by the devices for a stationary observer. [[Frank Popper]], the eminent art historian, among others, commented on Palatnik's "luminous mobiles" and their aesthetic of motion.

More recently, the term has been applied to the work of [[Ian Nunn]], a Canadian computer scientist and artist who has done extensive work in the application of [[interference pigments]] and films to 2-dimensional painting surfaces. These special effect pigments, such as [[ChromaFlair]], exhibit strong directional [[spectral reflectance]] and colour shifting with the angle of view. In Nunn's work, the viewer moves while the painting remains stationary. Elements in the picture change colour, appear and disappear as both the angle of viewing and the angle of illumination change.

'''Korean architecture''' refers to the [[built environment]] of [[Korea]] from c. 30,000 BC to the present.

==Introduction==
From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the k'a unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."

The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom (37 BC – 668 AD)—in palaces in [[Pyongyang]], for instance—a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Goryeo (Koryo) dynasty (918–1392). The Amita Hall of the Buseok temple in Yeongju is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early [[Joseon dynasty]]), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Han dynasty in China]] influence during the Mongolian [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namdaemun Gate [[Namdaemun]], Korea's first national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.

In the mid-Joseon period, the winglike bracket form appeared (an example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of [[Jongmyo]], Seoul), which, according to some authors, better suited the peninsula's poor economic situation that resulted from repetitive invasions. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. [[Korean Confucianism]] also led to more sober and simple solutions.

==Historical architecture==

===Prehistoric architecture===
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Amsadong-Neolithic.age-01.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed Neolithic-period huts in [[Amsa-dong]], [[Gangdong-gu]], [[Seoul]]]]
In the [[Prehistoric Korea|Paleolithic]] the first inhabitants of the Korean peninsula used caves, rockshelters, and portable shelters. The remains of a portable shelter dating to c. 30,000&amp;nbsp;BC were excavated at the Seokjang-ri site in South Chungcheong Province.&lt;ref name=Jipjari&gt;Jipjari [House]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp.1130-1131.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest examples of [[pit-house]] [[architecture]] are from the [[Jeulmun Pottery Period]].&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt; Early pit-houses contained basic features such as hearths, storage pits, and space for working and sleeping.

Log houses were built by laying logs horizontally one on top of one another. The interstices between the logs were filled with clay to keep the wind out. Similar houses are still found in mountainous areas as like [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]] province.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"/&gt;

Elevated houses, which probably originated in the southern regions, are believed to have first been built as storage houses to store grains out of the reach of animals and to keep them cool. This style still survives in the two-story pavilions and lookout stands erected in melon patches and orchards around the countryside.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"/&gt;

In the [[Mumun Pottery Period|Mumun period]] buildings were pit dwellings with walls of [[wattle-and-daub]] and [[Thatching|thatched roof]]s.&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt; Raised-floor architecture first appeared in the Korean peninsula in the Middle Mumun, c. 850–550&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt;

[[Megaliths#Megalithic Traditions of Asia: the Korean Peninsula|Megaliths]], sometimes called [[dolmen]]s, are the burials of important and prestigious persons of the Mumun Pottery Period (1500–300&amp;nbsp;BC). They have been found in great numbers and along with stone-cist burials, megaliths and are the main examples of mortuary architecture in the Mumun. There are three types of megaliths: (1) the southern type, which is low and often a simple slab with supporting stones, (2) the northern type, which is larger and shaped much like a table, and (3) the capstone type, which has a capstone with no supporting stones. The distribution of the dolmens would imply some relation to other global [[megalithic]] cultures.

===Proto–Three Kingdoms Period (c. 1st-2nd century BC to 3rd-4th century AD)===
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence of [[ondol]]([[Hangul]]: 온돌), the Korean floor panel heating system, was found in the architectural remains of early [[Proto–Three Kingdoms|Protohistoric period]].&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt;

According to Chinese text [[Sanguo Zhi]], it recorded the existence of three types of prehistoric dwellings in Korea: pit houses, log houses and elevated houses. Only the remains of pit houses have been identified, however. Pit houses consisted of a 20–150&amp;nbsp;cm deep pit and a superstructure of grass and clay supported by a tripod-like frame made of timber to provide protection from the wind and rain. Pit houses of the Neolithic period had circular or oval pits about 5–6 meters in diameter with a hearth at the center. Most of the early ones were located on hills. As these dwellings moved down nearer to rivers, the pits became rectangular in shape as well as larger, with two separated hearths.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/arc/prehistoric_period.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
In 108&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[China|Chinese]] commanderies was established after the destruction of [[Gojoseon]]. Official buildings of this period were built of wood and brick and roofed with tiles having the features of Chinese construction.

===Three Kingdoms Period (c. 3rd-4th century-668)===

====Common architecture====
In the Three Kingdoms Period, some people lived in pit-houses while others lived in raised-floor buildings. For example, the Hanseong ([[Hangul]]: 한성, 漢城; an eastern part of Seoul and western part of Hanam city in Gyeonggi Province) Baekje settlement of Seongdong-ri in Gyeonggi Province contained only pit-houses,&lt;ref&gt;Seongdong-ri Jibjari [The Seongdong-ri Settlement Site]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp. 652-653.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Silla settlement of Siji-dong in [[Daegu|Greater Daegu]] contained only raised-floor architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Siji-dong Yujeok [The Siji-dong Site]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp. 749-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fortress architecture====
{{main article|Korean fortress}}
[[Goguryeo]], the largest kingdom among the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], is renowned for its mountain fortresses built horizontally and vertically along the incline of slopes. One of the well-preserved Goguryeo fortresses is Baekam fortress (白巖城) constructed before 6th century in present-day South-West Manchuria. A Chinese historian noted, "The Goguryeo people like to build their palaces well." Patterned tiles and ornate bracket systems were already in use in many palaces in Pyongyang, the capital, and other town-fortresses in what now is [[Manchuria]].

====Religious architecture====
{{See also|Korean pagoda}}
{{double image|right|익산 미륵사지 석탑.jpg|190|Temple Miruksa.jpg|200|The western stone pagoda that was built during the Baekje Kingdom era in the Temple, Mireuksa|Reconstruction of the eastern stone pagoda of Mireuksa Temple.}}
The construction of Buddhist temples was undertaken after Buddhism was introduced in 372 by way of northern China. A series of excavations in 1936-1938 unearthed the sites of several major temples near Pyongyang, including those in Cheongam-ri, Wono-ri and Sango-ri. The excavations disclosed that the temples were built in a Goguryeo style known as "three Halls-one Pagoda," with each hall in the east, west and north, and an entrance gate in the south. In most cases, the central pagodas had an octagonal plan. Palace buildings appear to have been arranged in this way as well.

[[Baekje]] was founded in 18 BC and its territory included the west coast of the Korean peninsula. After the fall of Nangnang County under the Han dynasty in China, Baekje established friendships with China and Japan. Great temples were built during this time. The earliest stone [[pagoda]] of the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in [[Iksan]] county is of particular interest because it shows the transitional features from a wooden pagoda to a stone one. Baekje assimilated diverse influences and expressed its derivation from Chinese models. Later, important elements of the architectural style of Baekje were adopted by Japan.

Baekje was heavily influenced by Goguryeo because the first King Onjo of Baekje was a son of the Goguryeo's first king Go Ju-mong as well as by southern China. As it expanded southward, moving its capital to Ungjin (current Gongju) in 475 and to Sabi (current Buyeo) in 538, its arts became richer and more refined than that of Goguryeo. Also characteristic of Baekje architecture is its use of curvilinear designs. Though no Baekje buildings are extant - in fact, no wooden structure of any of the Three Kingdoms now remains - it is possible to deduce from Horyuji temple in Japan, which Baekje architects and technicians helped to build, that Baekje's architecture came into full bloom after the introduction of Buddhism in 384. What remains in the building sites, patterned tiles and other relics, as well as the stone pagodas that have survived the ravages of time, testifies to the highly developed culture of Baekje.

The site of Mireuksa temple, the largest in Baekje, was excavated in 1980 at Iksan of Jeollabuk-do Province. The excavation disclosed many hitherto unknown facts about Baekje architecture. A stone pagoda at Mireuksa temple is one of two extant Baekje pagodas. It is also the largest as well as being the oldest of all Korean pagodas. Mireuksa temple had an unusual arrangement of three pagodas erected in a straight line going from east to west, each with a hall to its north. Each pagoda and hall appear to have been surrounded by covered corridors, giving the appearance of three separate temples of a style called "one Hall-one Pagoda." The pagoda at the center was found to have been made of wood, while the other two were made of stone. The sites of a large main hall and a middle gate were unearthed to the north and south of the wooden pagoda.

When the site of Jeongnimsa temple was excavated in 1982, which had also been the site of the other existing Baekje pagoda, the remains of a main hall and a lecture hall arranged on the main axis one behind the other were unearthed to the north of the pagoda. The remains of a middle gate, a main gate and a pond arranged on the main axis one in front of the other were also discovered to its south. It was found that the temple was surrounded by corridors from the middle gate to the lecture hall. This "one Pagoda" style was typical of Baekje, as the excavations of the temple site in Gunsu-ri and in Gumgangsa temple in Buyeo in 1964. The building sites of Gumgangsa temple, however, were arranged on the main axis going from east to west rather than from north to south.

[[Silla]] was the last of the three kingdoms to develop into a full-fledged kingdom. Buddhist temples were built in Silla. One of the well known examples of Silla architecture is [[Cheomseongdae]], said to be the first stone observatory in Asia. It was built during the reign of [[Queen Seondeok of Silla|Queen Seondeok]] (632-646). The structure is known for its unique and elegant form.

Silla came under Buddhist influence after 527. Since its temple was separated from China by Goguryeo or Baekje, China's cultural influence was much diluted. 

One of the earliest Silla temples, Hwangnyongsa temple was systematically excavated and studied in 1976, and found to have been of considerable magnitude. It stood in a square walled area, the longest side of which was 288 meters. The area enclosed by corridors alone was about 19,040 square meters. The [[Samguk Sagi]] (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) records that there was a nine-story wooden pagoda built here in 645 that was about 80 meters high by today's scale. A large image of Sakyamuni Buddha is also recorded to have been enshrined in the main hall with the stone pedestal still remaining. Constructed in the middle of the 6th century, Hwangnyongsa temple flourished for more than 680 years during which time the halls were rearranged many times. In its prime, immediately before Silla's unification of the peninsula in 668, it was arranged in the "three Halls-one Pagoda" style, quite unlike the "one Hall-one Pagoda" style of Baekje's Mireuksa temple.

Another major Silla temple was Bunhwangsa, on the site of which still stands three stories of what is recorded to have been a nine-story pagoda. As the remains show, the pagoda was made of stones cut to look like bricks. A set of stone flagpole pillars in addition to other stone relics also remain.

====Royal architecture====
Many palaces are recorded as having been built in Baekje. Some traces of them can be found at both Busosanseong, the third palace of this kingdom, and at the site of Gungnamji pond, which is mentioned in the Samguk sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms). Gungnamji means "pond in the south of the palace."

====Tomb architecture====
[[File:Tomb of the General 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tomb of the General]], presumed to be the tomb of a great Goguryeo king or military official.  Located in Ji'an, China.]]
Three Kingdoms Period mortuary architecture was monumental in scale. For example, in Goguryeo two different types of mortuary architecture evolved during this period: one type of burial is a stepped pyramid made of stone, while another is a large earth mound form. The [[Cheonmachong]] mounded burial is an example of the monumental style of mortuary architecture in the ancient Silla capital at [[Gyeongju]].

Murals in tombs dating from Goguryeo also reveal a great deal about the architecture of that period as many of them depict buildings which have pillars with entasis. Many have capitals on top of them. The murals reveal that the wooden bracket structures and coloring on the timbers, all characteristic of later Korean structures, were already in use at that time.

Korea also has a rich architectural heritage of tombs and town-wall construction. The brick tomb of [[Muryeong of Baekje|King Muryong]] (501–523 AD) is remarkable for its vaulted ceiling and arch construction.

===Unified Silla Dynasty (668-935) architecture===

====Religious architecture====
[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-32.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bulguksa|Bulguk Temple]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site.]]
The plans of Buddhist temples were characterized by two pagodas in front of the central main hall in a symmetrical layout on the north-south axis with other buildings. [[Bulguksa|Bulguksa Temple]], built on a stone platform at the foothill of Mt. Toham near Gyeongju, is the oldest existing temple in Korea. The temple was first founded early in the 6th century and was entirely rebuilt and enlarged in 752. The original platform and foundations have remained intact to the present, but the existing wooden buildings were reconstructed during the Joseon dynasty.

The stone work of the two-story platform exhibits a superb sense of architectural organization and advanced building methods. Two stone pagodas stand in front of the main hall of the temple. The simpler [[Seokgatap]] located to the left of the court represents Buddha's manifestation in a transcendent calm. It has three stories with two pedestal layers and a total height reaching about twenty-five feet. The pagoda consists of simple undecorated pedestal slabs and three-story stupa each of which has five stepped eaves and truncated roofs. These characteristics constitute a typical form of the Korean stone pagodas.
[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-24.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Dabotap|Dabo Pagoda]], a national treasure of South Korea.]]
To the right of the court, the complex [[Dabotap]] represents Buddha's manifestation in a diversified universe, and is unique in Korea, further so in Asia. With a height of thirty-five feet, this pagoda has one pedestal with a staircase on each side, four main stories with balustrade and is characterized by the final crown-ball-and-plate sequence. The design motif of the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]] is apparent in mouldings and other details of the pagoda.

The rock cave shrine of [[Seokguram]] is located on the crest of Mt. Toham. It was built by the same master architect of Bulguksa Temple, and built around the same era. This cave shrine was artificially and skillfully constructed with granite blocks and covered with an earth mound on top to give the appearance of a natural landscape. The shrine boasts a rectangular anteroom lined with large stone slabs carved with the figures of the protectors of Buddhism on each side of the walls and at the entrance passageway to the main chamber. The circular main chamber covered by an elegant dome ceiling and surrounded by carved stone wall panels depicting Boddhisattvas and the ten disciples. The graceful statue of Buddha on a lotus pedestal in the center is the dominant feature of the chamber.

Rock cave shrines are not rare in Asia, but few of these shrines and sculptures reveal such high level of artistry. None are as religiously and artistically complete in overall design as those at Seokguram

====Royal architecture====
[[File:Gyeongju anapji pond 2006-03-24.JPG|thumb|right|[[Anapji]] pond in [[Gyeongju]]]]
United Silla architecture is defined as from the 7th century to the 10th century. After the unification of the Korean peninsula into the kingdom of United Silla, Korean institutions were radically transformed. United Silla absorbed the fully matured culture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasty in China, and at the same time developed a unique [[cultural identity]]. New Buddhist sects were introduced from the T'ang and [[Buddhist art]] flourished. It was a period of peace and cultural advancement in all fields of the arts.

Architecture flourished in the royal capital of Gyeongju, though almost all traces of the former glory have vanished at the present time. The city had nearly 200,000 inhabitants at its peak, and was strategically located at the junction of two rivers and three mountains that encircle a fertile basin of about 170&amp;nbsp;km² in area. The urban area of the city was developed and expanded in three stages. In the second stage, when [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple was located in the center, the region was developed into a grid network of road patterns with wide streets.

One of the Palace sites is marked by the [[Water reservoir|artificial lake]] of [[Anapji]] with stone works of [[retaining wall]]s delineating the former building location. The residential district of the nobles in the city was composed of great houses which were constructed conforming to the [[building code]] that granted privileges to the nobles, but forbidden to the commoners. Tiles from many ruins of the buildings were found everywhere. Of those that are still intact, show elegant and graceful design.

===Goryeo (Koryŏ) Dynasty (918-1392) architecture===
[[File:Goryeo Seopum.jpg|190px|thumb|right|A Goryeo painting depicting a royal palace.]]
Goryeo (Koryo) architecture is defined as the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent [[Buddhist temple]]s and [[pagodas]] were developed based on religious needs, as [[Buddhism]] played an important role in the culture and society at the time. It is unfortunate that little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.

Few remaining wooden structures from the late Goryeo period in [[South Korea]] show us significantly simpler bracketing than those from the 'Choson' period architecture. Bright and soft coloring of these structures had been further developed since the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/14dancheong.htm Dancheong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622234947/http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/14dancheong.htm |date=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) architecture===
*{{commonscat inline|Architecture of the Joseon Dynasty}}
*''See also: [[Joseon Dynasty#Architecture|Joseon Dynasty architecture]]; and [[Five Grand Palaces]].''
[[File:Donggwol-do.jpg|right|thumb|500px|''[[Donggwoldo]]'', a landscape of the once extensive grounds of [[Changdeokgung|Changdeokgung Palace]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and [[Changgyeonggung|Changgyeonggung Palace]].  Painted c. 1830.]]

Joseon architecture is defined as from the 14th century to the beginning of 20th century. The founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1392 brought to power like-minded men steeped in the doctrines of [[Neo-Confucianism]], which had slowly percolated into Korea from China in the 14th century. This ushered in a new environment that was relatively hostile to Buddhism, causing the state to gradually shift its patronage from Buddhist temples to Confucian institutions. Throughout the early dynasty, the impetus to reform society along Neo-Confucian lines led to the construction of [[hyanggyo]] (local schools) in Seoul and numerous provincial cities. Here, sons of the aristocracy prepared for civil service careers in an atmosphere of Confucian learning. Although these institutions endured through the end of the dynasty, they began to fall out of favor in the mid-16th century for a variety of reasons. Among these, the rise in population made it the prospects of a civil service career less likely than in earlier years. Also, as the [[yangban]] aristocracy matured in its understanding of Neo-Confucianism, they grew more selective in the quality and type of instruction they favored for their sons. As a result, private Confucian academies ([[seowon]]) gradually supplanted hyanggyos and became a staple of rural aristocratic life until the end of the dynasty.

Neo-Confucianism inspired new architectural paradigms. Jaesil, or clan memorial halls, became common in many villages where [[Extended family|extended families]] erected facilities for common veneration of a distant ancestor. Jongmyo, or memorial shrines, were established by the government to commemorate exceptional acts of filial piety or devotion. Even beyond these archetypes, the [[aesthetics]] of Neo-Confucianism, which favored practicality, frugality, and harmony with nature, forged a consistent architectural style throughout Korean society.

The most famous town walls are those of Seoul and Suwon. The capital's stone wall, constructed in 1396 and rebuilt in 1422, was sixteen kilometers long (only traces remain today) and had eight gates (including Namdaemun, the South Gate); Suwon's town wall, completed in 1796, was a model of construction methods in Asia at that time, as it benefited from Western influence and techniques.

===Colonial period architecture===

During the Japanese occupation in the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Colonial Korea]] era from 1910 to 1945, there was an attempt by the colonial government of the [[Empire of Japan]] to replace Korean architecture with [[Japanese architecture|Japanese architectural traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bartholomew, 'Choson Dynasty Royal Compounds: Windows to a Lost Culture', in Transactions: Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch Vol. 68 (Seoul: RAS, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Significant structures of Korean Imperial palace compounds and their traditional [[Korean gardens]] were demolished.  Important landscape elements were removed and sold or taken for use in Japan. Ancient [[bunjae]] trees were taken for replanting as [[bonsai]] in Japanese gardens. Also during Japanese occupation, the construction of traditional Korean religious buildings (Buddhist or Confucian) was discouraged, as well as adaptations in Christian churches. Some Korean people resisted the Japanese nationalist agenda by building traditional Korean [[hanok]] homes, such as the houses of [[Jeonju]] village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2881118 Hanok hotels become a hip choice]&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial disregard for Korean architecture and its history left important Korean landmarks neglected and unmaintained, and the deterioration or demolition of significant examples of architecture resulted.  Some historic buildings were also redecorated using Japanese ornamentation methods.

Japanese architecture was first introduced to Colonial Korea via transportation infrastructure-building programs. New [[railway]] lines had Japanese-type [[railway station]]s and [[hotel]]s. The Japanese also built new [[city hall]]s, post offices, [[barracks]] and [[military base]]s, jails and [[prison]]s, and [[police station]]s and [[Koban (police box)|police boxes (''koban'')]]. Having prohibited the use of the [[Korean language]] in the media and education, Japan built new schools for the Japanese education of Koreans.

Western 'Euro-American' Revival architectural styles were used for some new buildings important to the Japanese occupation in Korea. An example is the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] [[Japanese General Government Building, Seoul|Japanese General Government Building]] (1926), the [[Seoul Station#Old Seoul Station|Seoul Station]] (1925), and the [[Seoul City Hall]] (1926).

Materials for building construction in Korea were in short supply. The Korean [[Old growth forest|old-growth]] forests and particularly large [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] logs were under Japanese [[logging]] operations and shipped to Japan, along with other exportable [[building material]]s.

The Japanese occupation blocked 20th century Western design movements, including [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernist architecture]], from reaching Colonial Korea. Korean architecture with 20th-century influences did not develop until after Korean independence in 1946.

==Modern architecture==

===Post-war period and Korean War architecture===
After the [[Surrender of Japan]] in 1945, American architecture assumed supremacy. Under [[Douglas MacArthur]], who set Korean domestic and political policy from the [[Supreme Command of the Allied Powers]] headquarters in [[Tokyo]]. Korean architecture by Koreans began once again in domestic areas, with extensive repair of the missionary churches being given priority funding. Essential repair to infrastructure followed, more patch-work than new projects, and block-built hospitals, schools, industries began simple construction under military supervision.

Seoul had survived much of [[World War II]] but during the [[Korean War]] (1950&amp;ndash;1953), many buildings were destroyed, with the city changing command between [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n powers five times. [[Urban warfare|Street-to-street fighting]] and [[artillery]] barrages levelled much of the city, as well as the bridges over the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].  Important architectural sites were overrun and burnt by invading armies, [[looting]] was extensive, and the urban landscape suffered with little money for repairs.

With the armistice, and distinct architectural styles determined by foreign governments began a long period of development.

In the north, [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist]] and absolutist, often [[brutalist architecture]], was championed. North Korean architects studied in [[Moscow]] or [[Satellite state|Soviet satellites]], and brought back socialist worker styles and huge celebratory people's architecture on a grand and massively impressive scale.  [[Nomenklatura|Nomenclatura]] lived in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style apartment blocks, farmers and rural workers lived in traditional houses as they always had; urbanization did not occur.  Grand buildings and huge public squares were developed in [[Pyongyang]] as architectural showpieces.  Formal processional landscapes accompanied these sites.  Nearly all architecture was government sponsored, and maintained great homogeneity of function and style.

In the south, American models defined all new Korean buildings of any importance, with domestic architecture both civil and rural keeping to traditional buildings, building techniques, and using local materials, and local vernacular styles.  The pragmatic need to rebuild a country devastated by genocide, then a civil war, led to ad hoc buildings with no particular styles, extended repeatedly, and a factory system of simple cheap expendable buildings.  As few Korean cities had a grid-system, and were often given limits by mountains, few if any urban landscapes had a sense of distinction; by the mid-1950s, rural areas were underfunded, urban areas overfilled, and [[urban sprawl]] began with little money to build distinctive important buildings.

Buildings tended to be built quickly with little regard for local identity.  As the need for housing for workers increased, traditional [[hanok]] villages were razed, hundreds of simple cheap apartments were put up very fast, and [[Bedroom community|bedroom communities]] on the periphery of the urban centres grew, built and financed as company housing.

===Sports architecture===

South Korea was selected to host the [[1986 Asian Games]] and the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic games]], which spurred waves of new building activity. To market the country globally, international architects were encouraged to submit designs, introducing alternative concepts for modern architecture that began to put style and form ahead of spartan practicality. Historically, sports architecture has occupied the most money and the greatest expression of form identity within Korea. Hundreds of billions of [[South Korean won|won]] have been spent on defining Korea as a sports mecca with the architecture leading the way.

Most of the largest projects in the South, as in the North, were government sponsored works: but instead worked in confined, rather than open spaces, and worked with huge amounts of enclosed space, primarily in the state subsidized hugely expensive sports architecture. Korea since the 1990s had its most notable architectural works driven by sports: the two times which the country has hosted the Asian Games (1986 and 2014),the [[1988 Summer Olympics]],the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] [[2003 Summer Universiade]] and [[2015 Summer Universiade]], The country also hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], as well as great support being given by the [[chaebol]]s such as the [[Samsung]] Group which itself owned the sports teams for marketing purposes.

Important architects at this time and their works, often led by the atelier-style architectural co-operative [[Space Group of Korea]], were:

* [[Park Kil-ryong]]
* [[Jungup Kim or Kim Chung-up]] - Trained in France and designed the Olympic Memorial Gate/World Peace Gate, 1988.
* [[Jongseong Kim]] – Weight Lifting Gymnasium, Olympic Park, 1986.
* [[Kim Swoo Geun]] who trained in Tokyo - Olympic Stadium. 1984. Its total area is 133,649 square metres, with 100,000 seats. It is 245×180&amp;nbsp;m diameter and 830&amp;nbsp;m in perimeter.
* [[Kyu Sung Woo]] – Olympic Village, 1984.

===Post-modern Korean architecture===

[[File:Hdipark.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Hyundai]] I-Park Tower.]]
[[File:Jongno Tower.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Jongno Tower]].]]

It wasn't until the late 1980s and early 1990s that an entirely new generation of Korean architects had the freedom and the financing to build Korean architecture in a distinct Korean manner. This was a result of architects studying and training in Europe, Canada, and even in South America, and seeing the need for more of a sense of unique style, and more sophisticated materials.  There was a new determination that nationalistic architectural elements had to be revived and refined. Buildings had to mean something within their cultural context.

Post-modern Korean architecture is defined as from 1986 to 2005. Cultural and museum buildings have followed; with city halls and buildings for the civil service appearing generally in a New York/Chicago style rather than following London or Paris trends.

Individuality and experimentation became the new cause for young architects, however the country as a whole was slow to move from the old traditions into seeing good architecture aesthetics as being important to the sense of a village, town, or city. Change was forced at times against intense resistance, and new buildings evolved at great cost to the architects and builders and within a great tension.

Much of the growth of new architecture came from retail stores, clothing shops, bistros, cafes, and bars; and the underside of architectural commissions, rather than from major [[government contracts]] or the financial and corporate community. Foreign corporations setting up Korean headquarters also brought in an entirely new spirit of architecture to define their own visions.

In recent years a number of large and iconic modernist projects have been developed in Seoul such as the 2008 [[Dominique Perrault]] building at  [[Ewha Womans University]], the 2012 [[Seoul City Hall]] extension by [[iArc]] and the large [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]] designed by [[Zaha Hadid]] and opened in 2014.

'''Left-right asymmetry''' (LR asymmetry) refers to differences in structure ([[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]] breaking) across the mediolateral (left and right) plane in animals. This plane is defined with respect to the [[Anatomical terms of location|anteroposterior]] and [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsoventral]] axes and is perpendicular to both. Because the left-right plane is not strictly an axis (as it is not established through a [[morphogen]] gradient), to create asymmetry, the left and right sides need to be patterned separately.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, A. R. (2004). Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development. ''Science'', ''306''(5697), 828-833&lt;/ref&gt;

LR asymmetry is pervasive throughout [[Animal|metazoans]] and present throughout every major lineage. Notable examples include the large and small claws of the [[fiddler crab]], the left offset of the vertebrate heart, asymmetrical gut coiling in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]],'' and dextral (clockwise) and sinistral (counterclockwise) coiling of [[Gastropoda|gastropods]]. This asymmetry can be restricted to a specific organ or feature, as in the crab claws, or be expressed throughout the entire body as in snails.

== Developmental basis ==
Components of the [[Nodal signaling pathway]] have been implicated in left-right determination in a diverse set of taxa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Levin et al. (1995). A molecular pathway determining left-right asymmetry in chick embryogenesis. ''Cell'' 82, 803-814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Coutelis, J. B., González‐Morales, N., Géminard, C., &amp; Noselli, S. (2014). Diversity and convergence in the mechanisms establishing L/R asymmetry in metazoa. ''EMBO Reports'', e201438972.&lt;/ref&gt; While the mechanisms to set up the left-right sides appear to differ markedly among groups of organisms, ''[[NODAL|Nodal]]'' is consistently deployed in most of the lineages that have been examined (except for [[ecdysozoa]]ns).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In established model organisms such as mouse, chick, ''D. melanogaster,'' and ''[[African clawed frog|Xenopus]],'' ongoing research has begun to focus on cellular level symmetry-breaking mechanisms (e.g. cytoskeletal chirality, ciliary flow) that may lead to differential expression of molecules such as Nodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tee|first=Yee Han|last2=Shemesh|first2=Tom|last3=Thiagarajan|first3=Visalatchi|last4=Hariadi|first4=Rizal Fajar|last5=Anderson|first5=Karen L.|last6=Page|first6=Christopher|last7=Volkmann|first7=Niels|last8=Hanein|first8=Dorit|last9=Sivaramakrishnan|first9=Sivaraj|title=Cellular chirality arising from the self-organization of the actin cytoskeleton|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb3137|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=445–457|doi=10.1038/ncb3137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebrates ===
''Nodal'' was first described in the chick embryo, where genes ''activin receptor IIa, [[Sonic hedgehog]] (Shh),'' and ''chick nodal-related 1 (cNR-1)'' were found to be asymmetrically expressed across [[Primitive knot|Hensen’s node]] with ''cnR-1'' expressed on the left side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Misexpressing ''Shh'' or ''activin receptor IIa'' on the right side randomized heart asymmetry in the chick. This asymmetrical gene expression appears to be triggered by cell movements in the node.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gros|first=Jerome|last2=Feistel|first2=Kerstin|last3=Viebahn|first3=Christoph|last4=Blum|first4=Martin|last5=Tabin|first5=Clifford J.|date=2009-05-15|title=Cell Movements at Hensen’s Node Establish Left/Right Asymmetric Gene Expression in the Chick|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/941|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5929|pages=941–944|doi=10.1126/science.1172478|issn=0036-8075|pmc=2993078|pmid=19359542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mouse, the left side is distinguished from the right through Nodal flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Shigenori|last2=Tanaka|first2=Yosuke|last3=Okada|first3=Yasushi|last4=Takeda|first4=Sen|last5=Harada|first5=Akihiro|last6=Kanai|first6=Yoshimitsu|last7=Kido|first7=Mizuho|last8=Hirokawa|first8=Nobutaka|title=Randomization of Left–Right Asymmetry due to Loss of Nodal Cilia Generating Leftward Flow of Extraembryonic Fluid in Mice Lacking KIF3B Motor Protein|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81705-5|journal=Cell|volume=95|issue=6|pages=829–837|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally described from ''inversus viscerum (iv)'' and ''inversion of embryonic turning (inv)'' mouse mutants, which are characterized by a randomization of left-right phenotypes, Nodal flow refers to the movement of nodal cilia to create a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okada|first=Yasushi|last2=Nonaka|first2=Shigenori|last3=Tanaka|first3=Yosuke|last4=Saijoh|first4=Yukio|last5=Hamada|first5=Hiroshi|last6=Hirokawa|first6=Nobutaka|date=1999-10-01|title=Abnormal Nodal Flow Precedes Situs Inversus in iv and inv mice|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500801975|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=4|issue=4|pages=459–468|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80197-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carried in this leftward movement is Nodal, a signaling peptide from the [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]] family necessary to pattern left-right determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Jane|last2=Norris|first2=Dominic P.|last3=Robertson|first3=Elizabeth J.|date=2002-09-15|title=Nodal activity in the node governs left-right asymmetry|url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/16/18/2339|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=16|issue=18|pages=2339–2344|doi=10.1101/gad.1016202|issn=0890-9369|pmc=187443|pmid=12231623}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lateral plate mesoderm, Nodal then activates a positive feedback loop promoting its expression and its downstream effector ''[[PITX2|Pitx2]].'' To prevent expansion to the rightward portion of the embryo, Nodal activates ''Lefty1'' and ''Lefty2,'' which repress the Nodal signaling pathway by competing with Nodal binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meno|first=Chikara|last2=Shimono|first2=Akihiko|last3=Saijoh|first3=Yukio|last4=Yashiro|first4=Kenta|last5=Mochida|first5=Kyoko|last6=Ohishi|first6=Sachiko|last7=Noji|first7=Sumihare|last8=Kondoh|first8=Hisato|last9=Hamada|first9=Hiroshi|date=1998-08-07|title=lefty-1 Is Required for Left-Right Determination as a Regulator of lefty-2 and nodal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400814725|journal=Cell|volume=94|issue=3|pages=287–297|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81472-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Nodal flow through ciliary movement is not present in all vertebrates (e.g. the chick), asymmetric gene expression must be established in another way. One such idea posits that [[ion channel]]s and pumps (H+/K+ ATPase) generate differences in voltage and pH across the mediolateral plane, thus providing gradients to orient signaling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Michael|last2=Thorlin|first2=Thorleif|last3=Robinson|first3=Kenneth R.|last4=Nogi|first4=Taisaku|last5=Mercola|first5=Mark|date=2002-10-04|title=Asymmetries in H+/K+-ATPase and Cell Membrane Potentials Comprise a Very Early Step in Left-Right Patterning|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286740200939X|journal=Cell|volume=111|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00939-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-vertebrate deuterostomes ===
Recently, work has shown that the Nodal-Pitx2 pathway is present and functional in the non-vertebrate [[deuterostome]]s (tunicates, sea urchins).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimeld|first=Sebastian M.|last2=Levin|first2=Michael|date=2006-06-01|title=Evidence for the regulation of left-right asymmetry in Ciona intestinalis by ion flux|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20792/abstract|journal=Developmental Dynamics|volume=235|issue=6|pages=1543–1553|doi=10.1002/dvdy.20792|issn=1097-0177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=M Dolores|last2=de Crozé|first2=Noémie|last3=Haillot|first3=Emmanuel|last4=Lepage|first4=Thierry|date=2013-08-01|title=Nodal: master and commander of the dorsal–ventral and left–right axes in the sea urchin embryo|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X13000646|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|series=Developmental mechanisms, patterning and evolution|volume=23|issue=4|pages=445–453|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2013.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tunicate ([[Ascidiacea|ascidian]]) ''[[Ciona intestinalis]]'' and ''[[Sea pineapple|Halocynthia roretzi]]'', ''Nodal'' is expressed on the left side of the developing embryo and leads to downstream expression of ''Pitx2.'' At earlier stages, similar H+/K+ ATPase ion channels are reported to be necessary for correct left-right patterning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the role of cilia here is still unclear, one study observes that large-scale embryonic movements are required for left-right determination in ''H. roretzi,'' and that this movement is possibly achieved through ciliary movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nishide|first=Kazuhiko|last2=Mugitani|first2=Michio|last3=Kumano|first3=Gaku|last4=Nishida|first4=Hiroki|date=2012-04-15|title=Neurula rotation determines left-right asymmetry in ascidian tadpole larvae|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/139/8/1467|journal=Development|volume=139|issue=8|pages=1467–1475|doi=10.1242/dev.076083|issn=0950-1991|pmid=22399684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sea urchin, ''Nodal'' is expressed on the right side of the embryo, in contrast to the tunicate and vertebrate condition on the left side.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because [[protostome]]s appear to also express ''Nodal'' on their right side instead of the left (discussed below), some have suggested that this lends further evidence for the dorsoventral [[Inversion (evolutionary biology)|inversion]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Protostomes ===

==== Ecdysozoa ====
While ''D. melanogaster'' and nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' do show left-right asymmetry, the Nodal signaling pathway itself is absent in Ecdysozoa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead, cytoskeletal regulators such as Myo31DF, a type ID unconventional myosin, have been found to control left-right asymmetry in organ systems such as genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spéder|first=Pauline|last2=Ádám|first2=Géza|last3=Noselli|first3=Stéphane|date=2006-04-06|title=Type ID unconventional myosin controls left–right asymmetry in Drosophila|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/full/nature04623.html|journal=Nature|volume=440|issue=7085|pages=803–807|doi=10.1038/nature04623|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Ecdysozoa, the Nodal-Pitx2 pathways have been identified in many lineages within the [[Lophotrochozoa]]ns.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martín-Durán|first=José M.|last2=Vellutini|first2=Bruno C.|last3=Hejnol|first3=Andreas|date=2016-12-19|title=Embryonic chirality and the evolution of spiralian left–right asymmetries|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1710/20150411|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|volume=371|issue=1710|pages=20150411|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0411|issn=0962-8436|pmid=27821523|pmc=5104510}}&lt;/ref&gt; When found in [[brachiopod]]s and molluscs, these genes are asymmetrically expressed on the right.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Platyhelminthes, annelids, and nermeteans lack a Nodal orthologue and instead only express Pitx2, which was expressed in association to the nervous system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Whole body left-right asymmetry in gastropods ==
Whole body inversion is observed as chiral (dextral, sinistral) coiling in gastropods. While dextral coiling is the most common as it appears in 90-99% of living species, sinistral species still have arisen many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asami|first=Takahiro|last2=Cowie|first2=Robert H.|last3=Ohbayashi|first3=Kako|date=1998-01-01|title=Evolution of Mirror Images by Sexually Asymmetric Mating Behavior in Hermaphroditic Snails|jstor=10.1086/286163|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=152|issue=2|pages=225–236|doi=10.1086/286163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental basis of shell coiling ===
Gastropods undergo [[Cleavage (embryo)|spiral cleavage]], a feature commonly seen in lophotrochozoans. As the embryo divides, quartets of cells are oriented at angles to each other. In the snail ''Lymnaea stagnalis'', the direction of rotation during the first cell division signals whether the adult will show dextral or sinistral coiling,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meshcheryakov|first=V. N.|last2=Beloussov|first2=L. V.|title=Asymmetrical rotations of blastomeres in early cleavage of gastropoda|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00848080|journal=Wilhelm Roux's archives of developmental biology|volume=177|issue=3|pages=193–203|doi=10.1007/BF00848080|issn=0340-0794}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the third cleavage (8-cell stage), spindles in dextral snails are inclined clockwise whereas they are counterclockwise in sinistral snails.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shibazaki|first=Yuichiro|last2=Shimizu|first2=Miho|last3=Kuroda|first3=Reiko|date=2004-08-24|title=Body Handedness Is Directed by Genetically Determined Cytoskeletal Dynamics in the Early Embryo|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204005640|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=16|pages=1462–1467|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, injecting ''L. peregra'' sinistral eggs with the cytoplasm of dextral eggs before the second polar body formation will reverse the polarity of the sinistral embryos.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Gary|last2=Lundelius|first2=Judith W.|title=The developmental genetics of dextrality and sinistrality in the gastropodLymnaea peregra|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00848443|journal=Wilhelm Roux's archives of developmental biology|volume=191|issue=2|pages=69–83|doi=10.1007/BF00848443|issn=0340-0794}}&lt;/ref&gt; These data show that chirality is heritable and maternally deposited in ''Lymnaea''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Several studies have begun to investigate the molecular basis of this inheritance. ''Nodal'' and ''Pitx2'' are expressed on different sides of the ''L. stagnalis'' embryo depending on its chirality – right for dextral, left for sinistral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grande|first=Cristina|last2=Patel|first2=Nipam H.|date=2009-02-19|title=Nodal signalling is involved in left–right asymmetry in snails|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7232/full/nature07603.html|journal=Nature|volume=457|issue=7232|pages=1007–1011|doi=10.1038/nature07603|issn=0028-0836|pmc=2661027|pmid=19098895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downstream of ''Nodal, decapentaplegic (dpp),'' shows the same expression pattern.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimizu|first=Keisuke|last2=Iijima|first2=Minoru|last3=Setiamarga|first3=Davin HE|last4=Sarashina|first4=Isao|last5=Kudoh|first5=Tetsuhiro|last6=Asami|first6=Takahiro|last7=Gittenberger|first7=Edi|last8=Endo|first8=Kazuyoshi|date=2013-01-01|title=Left-right asymmetric expression of dpp in the mantle of gastropods correlates with asymmetric shell coiling|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-9139-4-15|journal=EvoDevo|volume=4|pages=15|doi=10.1186/2041-9139-4-15|issn=2041-9139|pmc=3680195|pmid=23711320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In limpets (gastropods without coiled shells) ''dpp'' is expressed symmetrically in ''Patella vulgata'' and ''Nipponacmea fuscoviridis''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Additionally, in ''N. fuscoviridis'', ''dpp'' has been shown to drive cell proliferation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurita|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Wada|first2=Hiroshi|date=2011-04-27|title=Evidence that gastropod torsion is driven by asymmetric cell proliferation activated by TGF-β signalling|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/04/16/rsbl.2011.0263|journal=Biology Letters|pages=rsbl20110263|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2011.0263|issn=1744-9561|pmc=3169068|pmid=21525052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upstream of Nodal, ''Lsdia1/2'' have been implicated in controlling ''L. stagnalis'' chirality.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davison|first=Angus|last2=McDowell|first2=Gary S.|last3=Holden|first3=Jennifer M.|last4=Johnson|first4=Harriet F.|last5=Koutsovoulos|first5=Georgios D.|last6=Liu|first6=M.

(2016) mapped the “chirality locus” to a 0.4 Mb region and determined that ''Lsdia2'' is the likely candidate for determining dextral or sinistral coiling.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is a diaphanous-related formin gene involved in cytoskeleton formation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Dextral embryos treated with drugs that inhibited formin activity phenocopied the sinistral condition. Concurrent work from Kuroda et al. (2016) identified the same ''Lsdia2'' gene (called ''Lsdia1'' in their study) but failed to reproduce the formin inhibition results in the Davison et al. study.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Additionally, Kuroda et al. (2016) did not find asymmetrically expressed ''Lsdia2'' as was seen in the Davison et al. (2016) study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Medium specificity''' is a consideration in [[aesthetics]] and [[art criticism]]. It is most closely associated with [[modernism]], but it predates it.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
According to [[Clement Greenberg]], who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that "the unique and proper area of competence" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are "unique to the nature" of a particular medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html
| title = Modernist Painting
| author = Clement Greenberg
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060105194921/http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |archivedate = 2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in painting, literal flatness and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] are emphasised rather than illusionism and [[figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa R. Schwartz, Jeannene M. Przyblyski, ''The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader'', Routledge, 2004, p8. {{ISBN|0-415-30866-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium specific can be seen to mean that ''"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material."'' This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. ''"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media."'' As early as 1776  [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] ''"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium."''&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze [[Visual arts|artwork]].   Critic [[N. Katherine Hayles]], for example, speaks of "media specific analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.altx.com/EBR/riposte/rip12/rip12hay.htm
| title = What Cybertext Theory Can't Do

| url = http://www.mala.bc.ca/~soules/animate.htm

|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224032144/http://www.mala.bc.ca/~soules/animate.htm |archivedate = 2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medium specificity suggests that a work of art can be said to be successful if it fulfills the promise contained in the medium used to bring the artwork into existence. Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. 

Art dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Medium Specificity&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''manicurist''' or '''nail technician''' is a person whose occupation is to style and shape a person's nails. This is achieved using a combination of decorating nails with coloured [[varnish]], transfers, gems or glitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au/occupation/Nail-Technician |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205162730/http://www.jobguide.thegoodguides.com.au/occupation/Nail-Technician |archivedate=December 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Basic treatments include [[manicures]] and [[pedicures]], as well as cleaning and filing nails and applying overlays or extensions.

Nail technicians can also paint designs onto nails with an [[airbrush]], by hand, using a stencil or stamping. A nail technician will often complete a consultation with the client to check for any signs of skin problems, deformities or [[nail disease]] before treatment and give clients advice about looking after their hands and nails, and recommend nail care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.com/nail_technician.html |title=Nail Technician Job Duties and Employment Options |website=Study.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training to become a nail technician involves doing a professional course that normally takes at least a year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/nailtechnician.aspx |title=Nail technician Job Information &amp;#124; National Careers Service |website=Nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses will  more than likely cover anatomy and physiology of the nails, hands, arms, feet and legs, contraindications that may arise, identifying diseases and disorders, proper sanitation and sterilizing techniques, how to perform nail services safely, gel polish application, liquid and powder enhancements and hard gel enhancements. The work itself tends to take place in a [[beauty salon]] although some nail technicians will make house calls to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.how2become.com/careers/mobile-nail-technician/ |title=Mobile Nail Technician 2016 |website=How2Become.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once licensed, many nail technicians will keep their own regular client list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmetology-license.com|title=Cosmetology License {{!}} How to Become a Licensed Cosmetologist|website=www.cosmetology-license.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">The '''Native American Renaissance''' is a term originally coined by [[literary critic|critic]] Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book ''Native American Renaissance'' to categorise the significant increase in production of [[Literature|literary works]] by [[Native Americans in the United States]] in the late 1960s and onwards. A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of [[N. Scott Momaday]]'s ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' in 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, "Introduction", in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1969.

==Earlier works by Native American authors==
Prior to the publication of ''House Made of Dawn,'' few Native American authors had published works of fiction that reached wide readership. Writers such as [[William Apess]], [[John Rollin Ridge]] and [[Simon Pokagon]] published works to little fanfare in the nineteenth century. Prior to the onset of [[World War II|WWII]], [[Mourning Dove (author)|Mourning Dove]], [[John Milton Oskison]], [[John Joseph Mathews]], [[Zitkala-Sa]], [[Charles Eastman]] and [[D'Arcy McNickle]] published literary works, although these works were relatively few in number.

==The Renaissance==

===Literary Renaissance===

In the work ''Native American Literatures: An Introduction,'' author Suzanne Lundquist suggests the Native American Renaissance has three elements:

*Reclamation of heritage through literary expression;
*Discovery and reevaluation of early texts by Native American authors; and
*Renewed interest in customary tribal artistic expression (i.e. mythology, ceremonialism, ritual, and the oral tradition of narrative transmission).&lt;ref&gt;Lundquist, Suzanne Evertsen. ''Native American Literatures: An Introduction.'' Consortium International Publishing Group: New York, NY. 2004, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln points out that in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a generation of Native Americans were coming of age who were the first of their respective tribal communities to receive a substantial English-language education, particularly outside [[Indian boarding school]]s, and with more graduating from colleges and universities. Conditions for [[Indigenous peoples|Native people]], while still very harsh during this period, had moved beyond the survival conditions of the early half of the century.

A period of [[historical revisionism]] was underway, as historians were more willing to look at difficulties in the history of the invasion and colonization of the [[North America|North American continent]]. As they explored the colonial and "[[Wild West]]" eras, some historians were more careful to represent events from the Native American perspective. This work inspired [[public interest]] in Native cultures and within Native American communities themselves; it was also a period of activism within Native American communities to achieve greater sovereignty and civil rights.

The ferment also inspired a group of young Native American writers, who emerged in the fields of poetry and novel-writing. In the span of a few years, these writers worked to expand the Native American literary [[Western canon|canon]].

By the 1980s, the rapid increase in materials and the development of [[Native American Studies]] departments and programs at several universities, such as [[the University of California, Los Angeles]]; [[Dartmouth College]], and [[Eastern Washington University]], led to the founding of scholarly journals, such as ''SAIL (Studies in American Indian Literature)'' and ''[[Wicazo Sa Review|Wíčazo Ša Review]]'' (1985). With the heightened interest in Native American writing, publishers established specialized imprints, such as [[HarperCollins|Harper and Row]]'s Native American Publishing Programme, which had the goal of promoting new voices and publication opportunities.

===Other meanings===
Although the primary use of the term has been literary, it has been used in a wider sense to describe "an increasing prosperity and sense of achievement among Indians [...] a widespread economic and cultural rebirth."&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Joan Nagel applies the term to the totality of "the resurgence of American Indian ethnic identification and the renascence of tribal cultures during the 1970s and 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;Joane Nagel, "False Faces: Ethnic Identity, Authenticity and Fraud in Native American Discourse and Politics," in ''Identity and Social Change'', ed. Joseph E. Davis (New Brunswick: Transaction, 2000), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native American Renaissance writers==

Writers typically included in the ''Native American Renaissance'' include:

*[[N. Scott Momaday]] ([[Kiowa]]), ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' (1968)
*[[Duane Niatum]] ([[Klallam]]), ''Ascending Red Cedar Moon'' (1974)
*[[Leslie Marmon Silko]] ([[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]), [[Ceremony (Silko novel)|''Ceremony'']] (1977)
*[[Gerald Vizenor]] ([[White Earth Chippewa|Chippewa]]), ''Darkness in Saint Louis Bearheart'' (1978)
*[[James Welch (poet)|James Welch]] ([[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]] and [[A'aninin]]), ''[[Winter in the Blood]]'' (1974)
*[[Joy Harjo]] ([[Muscogee]]), ''The Last Song'' (1975)
*[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Barney Bush - Native American Author (Shawnee)|Barney Bush]], ''Petroglyphs'' (1981)
*[[Simon J. Ortiz]] ([[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]]), ''From Sand Creek: Rising In This Heart Which Is Our America'' (1981)
*[[Louise Erdrich]] ([[Ojibwe|Chippewa]]), ''[[Love Medicine]]'' (1984)
*[[Paula Gunn Allen]] (Laguna), ''The Woman Who Owned the Shadows'' (1984)
*[[Maurice Kenny]] ([[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]), ''Tekonwatonti/Molly Brant (1735-1795): Poems of War'' (1992)
*[[nila northSun]] ([[Shoshone]]), ''A snake in her mouth: poems 1974-96'' (1997)

John Gamber argues that the characteristics of Renaissance writers are as follows: devotion to a sacred landscape; a homing-in plot, often associated with a protagonist's return to the reservation; the treatment of a mixed-blood protagonist's dilemma between two worlds as a central theme.&lt;ref&gt;"'We've Been Stuck in Place since ''House Made of Dawn'':Sherman Alexie and the Native American Renaissance", in Lee and Velie, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Erika Wurth points out that writers of this period were often concerned with writing for a non-Native audience.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Wurth, "The Fourth Wave", http://waxwingmag.org/writing.php?item=344&lt;/ref&gt;  Wurth and Gamber both agree that a new phase in Native writing began with the works of writers such as [[Sherman Alexie]], who rejected many of the formal and thematic concerns of Renaissance-era writing.

==Criticism==

The term ''Native American Renaissance'' has been criticized on a number of points.  As James Ruppert writes, "Scholars hesitate to use the phrase because it might imply that Native writers were not producing significant work before that time, or that these writers sprang up without longstanding community and tribal roots. Indeed, if this was a rebirth, what was the original birth?"&lt;ref&gt;James Ruppert, "Fiction: 1968–Present". In ''The Cambridge Companion to Native American Literature'', ed. Kenneth M. Roemer and Joy Porter (CUP, 2005).

Womack, Tol Foster, Daniel Heath Justice, Christopher B Teuton (Oklahoma, 2008), page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zj79HmexugcC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=%22native+american+renaissance%22&amp;lr=#PPA14,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;". Rebecca Tillett argues that "While the definition of the recent burgeoning of Native writing as a "renaissance" is highly accurate in its description of the sudden growth in the numbers of Native writers finding publication, it is also profoundly inaccurate in its tendence to obscure the often specifically political histories of Indian oratory and writings upon which many Native writers are drawing."&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Tillett, "On the Cutting Edge," in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PVC clothing''', commonly known as "vinyl clothing", is shiny clothing made of the plastic [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=53243 |title=poly(vinyl chloride) (CHEBI:53243) |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PVC plastic is also called vinyl. For this reason, this type of clothing is also called vinyl clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthybuilding.net/pvc/SortingOutVinyls.html |title=Sorting Out The Vinyls – EVA, PEVA, PVA, PVB, &amp; PVC |publisher=Healthybuilding.net |date=April 28, 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PVC is sometimes confused with the similarly shiny [[patent leather]].

The terms "PVC", "vinyl" and "PU" tend to be used interchangeably by retailers for clothing made from shiny plastic-coated fabrics. These fabrics
usually consist of a backing woven from [[polyester]] fibers with a surface coating of shiny plastic. The plastic layer itself is typically a blend of PVC and [[polyurethane]] (PU), with 100% PVC producing a stiff fabric with a glossy shine and 100% PU producing a stretchy fabric with a silky shine.
A manufacturer's label may say, for example, 67% polyester, 33% polyurethane for a fabric that contains no PVC; or 80% polyvinyl chloride, 20% polyurethane with mention of the polyester backing omitted.

The PVC can also be produced in bright colours (black, red, white, blue, orange, pink, silver, striped, etc.), adding further visual stimulus to the physical sensations produced by the material. The more frequently found colors are black and red. The PVC clothes are very associated with [[Retro-futurism|retro-futuristic look]], [[Goth subculture|Goth]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[alternative fashion]]s and [[clothing fetish]]. A common stereotype is the image of a [[dominatrix]] wearing a skin-tight PVC [[catsuit]], usually jet-black. In some cities it is more common to see people wearing PVC clothes, especially in large cities such as Berlin, London, New York City, Montreal, San Francisco, etc.

==History==

The plastics were used in clothing since its invention, particularly in raincoats. But PVC clothing became more noted in the 1960s and early 1970s fashion trend.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day, by Mila Contini, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion designers of that era saw the PVC plastic as the ideal material to design futuristic clothes. During that era, boots, raincoats, dresses and other PVC garments were made in many colors and even transparent and worn in public areas to some degrees. At that time it was also common to see PVC clothes on films and TV series such as [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], for example. And since then these shiny [[Plastic clothing|plastic clothes]] became a [[PVC fetishism|fetish]] object.

In mid 1990s, clothes made of PVC have been prevalent in young people's fashions, particularly in jackets, skirts and trousers, also appearing in the media.&lt;ref name="modices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modices.com.br/moda/a-proxima-textura-vinil/ |title=A próxima textura: vinil |publisher=Modices |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100002/http://modices.com.br/moda/a-proxima-textura-vinil/ |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renataabala.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/trend-alert-pecas-de-vinil/ |title=Trend Alert…Peças de Vinil… &amp;#124; Renata Bala – Consultora de Moda |publisher=Renataabala.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1990s it was common to see presenters, models, actresses, actors, singers and other celebrities wearing PVC clothes on TV and magazines. As fashions come round and round again, it would seem that PVC are appearing again in mainstream street fashions as well as continuing to be central to the fetish scene.&lt;ref name="modices" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutodopvc.org/pvcatualidades/noticia.php?edicao=36&amp;mat=63&amp;lang=pt |title=PVC Atualidades OnLine |publisher=Institutodopvc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820051647/http://www.institutodopvc.org/pvcatualidades/noticia.php?edicao=36&amp;mat=63&amp;lang=pt |archivedate=August 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers such as [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[André Courrèges]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/courreges.htm |title=Courrèges |publisher=Almanaque.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portaisdamoda.com.br/noticiaInt~id~15774~n~andre+courreges+volta+ao+mundo+da+moda.htm |title=André Courrèges volta ao mundo da moda |publisher=Portaisdamoda.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used PVC in their collections. Since 2010, the PVC has been the target of fashion not only for the female public but also to the male public.

==Caring for PVC clothing==

PVC clothing requires some care to make it last longer and maintain its appearance.
It is known that PVC clothes are made with a fabric covered with a plastic layer. For this reason, the PVC clothes should not be over-stretched, to avoid damage to the plastic layer.
When excessively stretching the clothing, the plastic layer can lose its smooth texture and stay striated, losing also part of the original shine, and may even tear.

If the PVC clothing is not soiled, many people will just freshen the polyester inside up with a fabric refresher product and wipe the plastic outside with a damp sponge. If there is need, PVC clothes should be washed by hand with warm water and a small amount of liquid [[detergent]]. [[Laundry detergent|Washing powder]] should not be used because the flakes can remain on clothing after washing, and also can stick to the plastic layer.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedvegas.net/vinylcare.html |title=Vinyl, PVC Taking Care of your Clothing |publisher=Wicked-Vegas |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To remove the detergent one should use cold water and after turning the garment inside out it should be left to dry under the shade. After drying the inside (polyester fabric), then it must be turned in the right direction to dry outside (plastic layer).&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

PVC clothing should never be [[Clothes iron|ironed]]. This type of clothing is made of heat sensitive plastics and which may melt under the iron, and high temperatures should be avoided from any source, such as flames, [[clothes dryer|dryers]], and cigarettes. The fumes from burning or smoking PVC plastic are dangerous.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

Different coloured PVC garments, especially white, should be stored separately from each other, otherwise staining may occur. PVC clothing is best stored hanging in a garment bag away from other clothing.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

The fabric used for PVC clothes is typically plastic-coated polyester. This PVC fabric is more resistant to wear and tear than rubber, and PVC clothing does not require the use of any shining products. However one can polish PVC clothing if desired with liquid [[silicone]] spray which is available from car accessory shops.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

'''The Prospect Theatre Company''' was an English company founded, as '''Prospect Productions''', in 1961. Based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]] from 1964 until 1969, the company, with [[Toby Robertson]] as artistic director and [[Richard Cottrell]] as associate director, toured both nationally and internationally with a mainly classical repertoire, providing notable appearances of such actors as [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Timothy West]]. The company became closely associated with the [[Edinburgh Festival]] after its first appearance there in 1967. Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Dorothy Tutin]] made significant appearances. Eventually the company found a new home at London's [[Old Vic]] in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company. Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise.

==Early years, Cambridge and Edinburgh==
[[Iain Mackintosh]], [[Richard Cottrell]] and [[Elizabeth Sweeting]] formed Prospect Productions in 1961 to present a summer season of plays at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. A successful first season led to a further season in 1962. The following year, when the Playhouse closed for renovations, Prospect became a touring company associated with the [[Century Theatre (UK)|Century Theatre]]. [[Toby Robertson]] directed the last play of the season, [[Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'', with [[Eileen Atkins]] and [[Trevor Martin]]. The production opened the newly restored [[Georgian Theatre Royal]] in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], then transferred to the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], London. The success of the Oxford seasons prompted the idea that Prospect should present productions beyond the summer season each year.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Prospect Theatre Company | work = | publisher =Ian McKellen Stage | date = | url =http://www.mckellen.com/stage/r2/prospect.htm | doi = | accessdate = 4 September 2014 | archiveurl =  | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, with support from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and [[Dadie Rylands|Dr. George Rylands]], Prospect became a touring company based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]], with Toby Robertson as artistic director, Richard Cottrell as associate director, and Iain Mackintosh as administrator. Between 1964 and 1966 Prospect staged 15 productions, presenting well-known plays as well as several rarely performed Classics including Vanbrugh's ''The Confederacy'', with [[Robert Eddison]] and [[Hy Hazell]], to celebrate the third centenary of Vanbrugh's birth, and [[Etherege]]'s ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', and a number of new plays. [[Timothy West]] joined the Company in 1966 to play [[Prospero]]. Later that year Prospect had its first invitation to the [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Prospect's first Edinburgh Festival appearance in 1967 was with [[Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', [[Lila Kedrova]] playing Madam Ranyevskaya in Cottrell's production. The production transferred to London, where Kedrova won the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' Best Actress of the Year Award. 1968 saw the production of Prospect's first "musical" - Gay's ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'', which was also the first Prospect show to be televised, and in 1969 the Company appeared for the first time at the Assembly Hall.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

At the 1969 Edinburgh festival [[Ian McKellen]] made his breakthrough performances with the company as [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] (directed by Cottrell) and Marlowe's [[Edward II (play)|Edward II]] (directed by Robertson), the latter in the play's first professional revival for 300 years and causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-toby-robertson-obe-theatre-director-1-2400165| publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=6 September 2012 | title= Obituary: Toby Robertson, OBE, theatre director | first=Alasdair | last= Steven | work=The Scotsman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy West appeared as McKellen's sparring partner in both those productions,&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; which subsequently toured Britain and Europe before being staged at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London and breaking box-office records at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=8 July 2012 | title= Toby Robertson obituary| first=Michael | last=Coveney | work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1967 and 1977 Prospect was invited to appear at eight Edinburgh International Festivals, and largely as a result of its close association with the Edinburgh Festival, Prospect was asked to tour abroad for the British Council, visiting the Middle East, Russia, Hong Kong, and Australia.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

==Years of touring==
In 1969 the Company was asked to extend its touring to the large "No 1" theatres in the regions; at the same time the Cambridge Arts Theatre wanted Prospect to help in the formation of a new theatre company. As these two developments pointed in totally different directions with implications of a conflicting scale of work, Richard Cottrell left Prospect to become director of the newly formed [[Cambridge Arts Theatre#Cambridge Theatre Company|Cambridge Theatre Company]]: Toby Robertson became cirector of Prospect, and its role as the UK's leading touring company was recognised, with its new name - The Prospect Theatre Company.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Under Robertson, the company pioneered a style of production in which stage designs and setting were kept to a minimum, partly from the belief that Shakespeare's plays in particular benefited from an uncluttered approach; this style also suited the company's needs when touring regional theatres, for which flexibility of staging was essential.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Emphasis was placed instead on quality acting and strikingly designed costumes, complemented by lighting and incidental music.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; [[Carl Davis]] composed several scores for the company, including for a modern dress production of ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'' (1971), ''[[Pericles]]'' (1973), and ''Pilgrim's Progress'' (1974/5) which led directly to the musical ''War Music'' (1977) with words by [[Homer]] and [[Christopher Logue]] and music by Donald Fraser.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

From 1970 to 1976 four major productions were created each year. As the only major company touring nationally, the choice of repertoire tended to be drawn more from the classics at the expense of new work. But alongside several Shakespeare productions the company staged such plays as [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'', [[Charles Macklin]]'s ''The Man of the World'', [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' (with Derek Jacobi, Timothy West and Dorothy Tutin, who won two major acting awards for her performance), Chekhov's ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', and [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Royal Hunt of the Sun]]''. A series of chamber works were commissioned, including Jane McCulloch's ''The Grand Tour'' for the Entry into Europe celebrations - an entertainment seen in London, Edinburgh, and the 1974 Brighton Festival.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

The strain of touring and meeting the increasingly high standards expected by theatre audiences throughout the country began to tell, and even with occasional London seasons either at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Round House]] or in the West end, it was felt increasingly desirable that Prospect should once again have a permanent and preferably metropolitan base to sustain its regional work.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowell157&gt;Rowell, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining the Old Vic==
[[Image:Waterloo the old vic 1.jpg|thumb|alt=The Old Vic, London.|The Old Vic Theatre, London]]
Looking for a suitable London base, Robertson believed that the [[Old Vic]] would best meet the company's needs and would add lustre to its reputation. For two years he sustained a campaign for the Old Vic to make Prospect its resident company.&lt;ref name=rowell157/&gt; For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged  by other companies at the theatre; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including ''Hamlet'' with Derek Jacobi,  ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' with [[Alec McCowen]] and Dorothy Tutin; and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' with [[Eileen Atkins]].&lt;ref name=rowell158&gt;Rowell, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =History of the Old Vic, 1950-1999 | work = | publisher =The Old Vic | date = | url =http://www.oldvictheatre.com/about-us/history-of-the-old-vic-2/1950-1999/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 5 September 2014 | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the Governors of The Old Vic announced "a marriage that was all but a merger" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of The Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of The Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council - already funding the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in London - could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. The company played a five-month season from January to May 1978, adding ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' to their repertory, and a four-month season from September to December presenting ''[[The Rivals]]'', ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'' with Atkins, and ''[[King Lear]]'' with [[Anthony Quayle]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, pp. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled "Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company".&lt;ref name=rowell160&gt;Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's ''Hamlet'' (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country),&lt;ref name=Continuum/&gt; followed by ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' with [[Ian Richardson]].&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; The following season, however, proved controversial: the double bill of ''The Padlock'' and ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', to mark the bicentenary of [[David Garrick]]'s death, and a revival of ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'' were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory.&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; An internal report by Prospect now questioned "whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the [Arts Council] Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was in effect fired from the post of artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw ''Macbeth'' with [[Peter O'Toole]], ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt; On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the Company, sealing its demise.&lt;ref name=Continuum&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunter | first =Adriana

Appeals to the Council for funding to be reinstated were denied. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic staging ''The Merchant of Venice'', then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt;

[[File:Save Outdoor Sculpture! (logo).jpg|thumb|222px|right|The SOS! Logo]]

'''Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!)''' is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor sculpture in the [[United States of America|United States]]. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource. 

The SOS! project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or "crowd-sourced" social media-driven initiatives.  

==History==
Save Outdoor Sculpture! was initiated by [[Heritage Preservation|Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_2/news_in_cons1.html|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture!: A Community-Based Conservation Program, Getty Conservation Institute Newsletter 22.2 (Summer 2007)|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far over 7,000 volunteers have cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues and monuments installed outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! About Page|accessdate=2009-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108041805/http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/SOS/aboutsos.htm|archivedate=2009-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Museum of American Art has become an active partner in the SOS! project, and SOS! material is available online as part of the Inventory of American Sculpture at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siris.si.edu/|title=The Inventory is part of the Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership has allowed the database that contains these records to be viewable online, and [http://sirismm.si.edu/siris/ariquickstart.htm searchable by state], [http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1HD764961858K.5006&amp;profile=ariall&amp;menu=search&amp;submenu=Browse&amp;ts=1337649618636 artist, subject or title].  The records in the Inventory pertain to all sculpture in the United States and a few outlying islands that have thus far been identified.

==Educational programs==
A primary objective  of SOS! is to educate, and a number of programs have been created for children. For example, SOS! has partnered with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] to create a Girl Scout patch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/gsupdate.pdf|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! Girl Scout Patch Program|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for scouts who participate in the project.

[[Image:Scroll.jpg|right|thumb|Scroll of the [[Book of Esther]], [[Seville]], [[Spain]].]]
[[File:Scroll ink materials.JPG|right|thumb|Ingredients used in making ink for Hebrew scrolls today.]]
A '''scroll''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), also known as a '''roll''', is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H9SWMK4U?url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/ |date=5 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of [[writing material]]. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction ([[boustrophedon]]).

Some scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: [[Torah]] scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.

==History of scroll use==
{{Main|History of scrolls}}
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''[[History of scrolls|volumen]]''}}{{See also|Roman Empire#Literacy, books, and education}}Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s. Parchment scrolls were used by the [[Israelites]] among others before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome|title=10 Innovations That Built Ancient Rome|author=|date=|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.

==Rolls==
[[File:Parliamentary archives.jpg|thumb|right|Rolls recording UK [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Acts of Parliament]] held in the [[Parliamentary Archives]], [[Palace of Westminster]], London]]
Shorter pieces of [[parchment]] or [[paper]] are called ''rolls'' or ''[[Rotulus|rotuli]]'', although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use ''roll'' instead of ''scroll''. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for [[manuscript]] administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60&amp;nbsp;cm or two feet wide.  Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.

A special Chinese form of short book, called the "whirlwind book," consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d|title=IDP Education - Bookbinding|author=|date=|website=idp.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the term ''scrow'' was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (''Rotulorum Clericus'') meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, 2008, "scrow".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by the codex==
The Romans invented the ''codex'' form of the book, folding the scroll into pages which made reading and handling the document much easier. Legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. 

Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or "leaves," and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. ''Codex'' is Latin for a "block of wood": the Latin ''liber'', the root of "library," and the German ''Buch'', the source of "book," both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection.

The term ''codex'' technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.

From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent discovery==
The oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy’s University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. 

The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075932/http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy |date=7 April 2014 }}.

==Modern technology ==
Modern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged [[Herculaneum_papyri|Herculaneum scrolls]], researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm Major breakthrough in reading ancient scrolls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123041620/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm |date=23 January 2015 }}, ''[[Science Daily]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seuso Treasure''' or '''Sevso Treasure''' ({{lang-hu|Seuso-kincsek}}; {{lang-hr|Seusovo blago}}), is a [[hoard]] of [[silver]] objects (14 items) from the late [[Roman Empire]]. The first pieces appeared on the market in [[London]] in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]]. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of [[Lebanon]]. It was put up for sale in [[New York City]] in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of [[Hungary]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Lebanon]] made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. [[Scotland Yard]] still has an open case on the matter.

The origin and [[provenance]] of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Time Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide/series-119/episode-3 |title=Time Team Specials – The Mystery of the Roman Treasure – Channel 4 |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014 [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140326_Orban_Magyarorszag_visszaszerezte_a_Seuso#rss |title=Orbán: Magyarország visszaszerezte a Seuso-kincset |publisher=hvg.hu |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/03/26/3101774/hungary-buys-back-7-roman-era.html?sp=/99/109/ |title=Hungary buys back 7 Roman-era silver trays, jugs|publisher=idahostatesman.com |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister described it as "Hungary's family silverware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/budapest/sevso-treasure-hungarys-family-silverware-returned_77609 |title=Sevso Treasure, "Hungary's family silverware," returned |publisher=Budapest Business Journal |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20170712_Baan_hetek_ota_itthon_van_a_Seusokincs_a_TEK_hozta_haza |title=Baán: Hetek óta itthon van a Seuso-kincs, a TEK hozta haza |publisher=HVG |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The [[treasure trove]] consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9&amp;nbsp;kg, which bears the inscription:

: ''Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa''
: ''Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis''

: May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be
: Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily.

==Discovery==
[[File:Sümegh józsef 02.jpg|thumb|right|190px|József Sümegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975–76 near Polgárdi]]The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from [[Vienna]] was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;[http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no Antiques Trade Gazette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001509/http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no |date=2007-09-29 }}, 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], described as being from "what was once the province of [[Phoenicia]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]".

=== Legal wrangling ===
The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of [[Polgárdi]] in central Hungary. Sümegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed.&lt;ref name = "Múlt-Kor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?id=20036&amp;pIdx=2 |title=Helyi divattal igazolják a Seuso-kincsek eredetét – Hírek – Múlt-kor történelmi magazin |publisher=mult-kor.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref name = "HVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon.bunugy/20120803_seuso_gyilkossag |title=Bűnügy: Bors: újra nyomoz az NNI a Seuso-kincseket megtaláló Sümegh meggyilkolása ügyében – HVG.hu |publisher=hvg.hu|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of [[Barbariga, Croatia|Barbariga]] in [[Istria]] (present-day [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of [[Pula]], an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) compound.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by [[Vesna Girardi-Jurkić]], to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peritz|first1=Romina|title=Borba za neprocjenjivo Seusovo blago|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/borba-za-neprocjenjivo-seusovo-blago-%E2%80%98do-zadnjeg-smo-vjerovali-da-jehrvatsko%E2%80%99/988673/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Croatia, et al. v.

The Marquess sued his solicitors [[Allen &amp; Overy]] for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the [[House of Lords]], the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Stationery"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|title=Sevso Case: Decision not to Prosecute|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|date=25 June 1999|column=WA111|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012090039/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|archive-date=2006-10-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the "Hunting Plate", an inscription is to be seen. It reads "Pelso", the Roman name for [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law|author1=Gibbon, K.F. |author2=American Council for Cultural Policy|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813536873 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigTNxl30ZgC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman [[tripod]] (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-curse-of-the-sevso-silver/302331/|title=The Curse of the Sevso Silver – The Atlantic|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In September 2006, London auctioneer [[Bonhams]] announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date.&lt;ref name="ATG" /&gt; A spokesman for the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.hu/culture/history/news/D999_news_200486.html "Sevso Treasure Up For Sale" at culture.hu – Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn]], particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|admission to the European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61012w0001.htm ''Hansard''] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/afrontpage/pdf/tancurrent.pdf Art Newspaper], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2393777,00.html Times] and [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924109,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vadász tál - Seuso kiállítás, Országház (3).JPG|thumb|right|The "Hunting plate" in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]

In March 2007, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that a further "187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=581 |title=The silver missing from the Sevso hoard? |publisher=theartnewspaper.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/lisa-westcott/sevso-treasure.htm |title=Archaeology of the Sevso Treasure &amp;#124; Current Archaeology  |publisher=archaeology.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel 4]] archaeology programme ''[[Time Team]]'' aired a [[Time Team (specials)#2008|special on the treasure]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide |title=Time Team Specials – Episode Guide – Channel 4  |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of [[Polgárdi]]. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.

==Return to Hungary==
On 26 March 2014, [[Viktor Orbán]], the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2" /&gt; The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungarian PM]] announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20170712_orban_seuso_kincs_hazakerult#rss |title=Orbán: Hazakerült a Seuso-kincsek további hét darabja |publisher=hvg.hu |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items will be moved to the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

'''''St. Quentin''''' is a painting attributed to the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Jacopo Pontormo]]. According to [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''Vite'', one of Pontormo's pupils, Gianmaria Pichi, was commissioned by his hometown of Sansepolcro a processional standard with the figure of St. Quentin; Pontormo decided to collaborate on the work, at the extent that he finished to complete most of it. The saint's posture resembles that of the ''[[Dying Slave]]'' by [[Michelangelo]]: the fact that Pontormo was friend of the latter, confirms the attribution.

The position of the nails in St. Quentin's body is directly inspired to [[Jacopo da Varagine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5441">The '''Symphony No. 4''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition by the American composer [[John Harbison]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Seattle Symphony]] with contributions from the philanthropists Richard and Constance Albrecht.  It was given its world premiere in [[Seattle]] on June 17, 2004 by the Seattle Symphony under the direction of [[Gerard Schwarz]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbison |first=John |authorlink=John Harbison |year=2003 |title=Symphony No. 4 |publisher=[[G. Schirmer Inc.]] |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/24250 |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Background===
The symphony was composed during a turbulent period in Harbison's life when his wife became very ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freedman |first=Geraldine |title=ASO will perform John Harbison work, new composition by young protégé Timo Andres |work=[[The Daily Gazette]] |date=March 25, 2010 |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2010/mar/25/0325_aso/ |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer wrote in the score program notes, "One morning at eight, in [[Bogliasco]], [[Italy]], where I was working, I receive a phone call - two o'clock the caller's time. I cannot describe the knowledge that struck during that call except to say that the breath of mortality, bearing at this moment on the person closest to me, came suddenly and radically near."  He continued:{{quote|Other action temporarily impossible, I went to work and by eleven A.M. had composed in every detail the fourth movement, which (perhaps superstitiously) I have not subsequently revised. This "Threnody" is not about loss but about the imminence and inevitability of loss at times we of course do not choose. Its early completion, far ahead now of the rest of the piece, affected the character of the whole symphony, especially the last movement, whose ritual formality embraces, the frantic dance and march which attempt to modify its character.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly 27 minutes and is composed in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Fanfare
#Intermezzo
#Scherzo
#Threnody
#Finale

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[piano]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been praised by music critics.  Lisa Hirsch of the ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' wrote, "It's an engrossing work, full of interesting detail and structural experimentation. Like the Mahler and Ravel, it deploys a very large orchestra, but the effects provided by that orchestra seem more studied and less organic than those in its companions, thought through rather than arising naturally from the melodic and harmonic elements of the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsch |first=Lisa |title=Boston's Ravishing Bay Area Bow |work=San Francisco Classical Voice |date=December 7, 2011 |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/bostons-ravishing-bay-area-bow |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Powers of the ''Boston Classical Review'' compared the symphony with Harbison's 1999 opera ''[[The Great Gatsby (opera)|The Great Gatsby]]'', writing:{{quote|The music shifts ideas incessantly: the opening Fanfare carries the flavor of ''Gatsby'', presenting a pastiche of jazzy ideas, set in formal structures. The second movement offers a bewildering array of themes, connected by a mood of introspection. The scherzo, the most straightforward of the sections, lacks humor but suggests an antic energy. The centerpiece, a fourth movement labeled Threnody, begins with a string-based theme, deeply lyrical and pensive, with accents from the back of the orchestra. The Finale creates some ease for the listener, shifting to less tense, major harmonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Powers |first=Keith |title=Morlot takes up the BSO's Harbison mantle in convincing fashion |work=Boston Classical Review |date=November 25, 2011 |url=http://bostonclassicalreview.com/2011/11/morlot-takes-up-the-bsos-harbison-mantle-in-convincing-fashion/ |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Matthew Guerrieri of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was slightly more critical of the work, however, saying "...the whole symphony feels like workings-through, of influences, forms, processes, difficulties."  He added, "The opening and closing movements had crisp force; the quieter movements, especially the piecemeal transparency of the 'Intermezzo,' were more skittish and hesitant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerrieri |first=Matthew |title=Ludovic Morlot conducts the BSO in a concert of Harbison, Ravel, and Mahler |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=November 26, 2011 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2011/11/26/ludovic-morlot-conducts-bso-concert-harbison-ravel-and-mahler/wvi26pgoAbhJBcz8UZuAoK/story.html |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore''''' is a 2011 animated short film directed by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] and [[Brandon Oldenburg]], and produced by [[Moonbot Studios]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higa |first=Michelle |title=The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore |url=http://www.shortoftheweek.com/2012/01/24/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore |publisher=Short of the Week |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as an "allegory about the curative powers of story," the film centers on [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using [[computer animation]], [[Scale model|miniatures]] and traditional hand-drawn techniques.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles&gt;{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|title=Oscar shorts: 'Morris Lessmore' has hybrid animation, iPad app|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/01/oscars-short-films-fantastic-flying-books-morris-lessmore-animation.html|accessdate=March 17, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. An official [[iPad]] app based on the film was also released in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]]. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore" Nominated for Best Animated Short in 2011 Oscars |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fantastic-flying-books-of-mr-morris-lessmore-nominated-for-best-animated-short-in-2011-oscars-2012-01-24 |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Morris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]] writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.

After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of [[Humpty Dumpty]], who urges Morris to follow him.

The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.

Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf.{{#tag:ref|The large book on which Morris sleeps is the same title; its inclusion may reference the studio's name "Moonbot". The library also includes Moon globes and in one scene the Moon is featured prominently in a window.|group="Note"}} He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.

Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Porkpie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buster Keaton]] wearing a [[pork pie hat]]]]
The book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at [[HarperCollins]] and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that.&lt;ref name=LosAngeles /&gt;

Morris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' and the tornado from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Also an inspiration was the real-life [[Hurricane Katrina]] which devastated New Orleans in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Like ''The Wizard of Oz'', the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm.

'''''The Magpie''''' ({{lang-fr|La Pie}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]], created during the winter of 1868&amp;ndash;1869 near the commune of [[Étretat]] in [[Normandy]]. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's fiancée [[Camille Doncieux]] and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (''effet de neige'').  Similar winter paintings were produced by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], and [[Paul Gauguin]].  Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.  This arbitrary time period was established for the first ''[[Impressionists in Winter|Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige]] '' exhibition, based on historical reports of severe winters collected by curators.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magpie'' is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet.  His first snowscape, ''[[A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur]]'', was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.  ''The Magpie'' was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting.  It was followed by ''[[The Red Cape]]'' (1869–1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett et al. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The canvas of ''The Magpie'' depicts a solitary black [[magpie]] perched on a gate formed in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]], as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows.  The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of [[colored shadow]]s, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] earlier in the century.

At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1869. Today, art historians classify ''The Magpie'' as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings.&lt;ref name="RouartGedo"&gt;Arts Council of Great Britain 1957, p. 43: "Perhaps Monet's greatest snow landscape."; {{harvnb|Rouart|1958|p=41}}: "This, Monet's finest snowscape..."; {{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=89}}: "...one of the most magnificent snow scenes in his entire oeuvre..."&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was privately held until the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.

==Background==
{{main|Claude Monet}}
In the late 1850s, French landscape painter [[Eugène Boudin]] (1824&amp;ndash;1898) introduced Monet (1840&amp;ndash;1926) to the art of painting ''[[en plein air]]''—"in the open air", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible [[metal paint tube]] (1841) and [[easel|portable easel]] brought painting, formerly confined to [[studio]]s, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. "If I have become a painter," Monet said, "I owe it to Boudin."{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=24}}
[[File:Monet - The Cart.jpg|thumb|left|''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867), Monet's first snowscape.]]
The landscape paintings of Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]] (1819&amp;ndash;1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in 1862,{{sfn|Herbert|1996|p=14}} Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for [[Local color (visual art)|local color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathey|1961|p=59}}: "...Jongkind discovered how the so-called "local color" changes with the seasons...It suddenly came to him that for the artist appearance, not reality, was the determining factor...the only thing that did matter was the atmospheric condition at a given moment. He shared this revelation with Monet, who, in turn, experimented by making two paintings of a road in Normandy from the same vantage point—the first one under a cloudy sky, and the second when the road was covered with snow."&lt;/ref&gt; "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," Monet later reminisced.{{sfn|Isham|2004|p=332}} "It was he who completed the education of my eye".{{sfn|Heinrich|2000|p=9}} This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'' (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single [[haystack]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].

[[Gustave Courbet]] (1819&amp;ndash;1877) had been painting ''effets de neige'', "snow effects", from as early as 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Courbet, Gustave (1856). ''Trees in the Snow''. National Galleries of Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; in a landscape style preferred by Japanese, Dutch, and Flemish artists. Influenced by Courbet, Monet painted his first snowscape, ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=805 Musée d'Orsay]: "With this choice of theme, Monet was following in the footsteps of Courbet who had tackled snowscapes in a number of genre scenes. But unlike the older painter, whose principal motif remained the stag and the hunter and who produced many anecdotal scenes, Monet painted an almost deserted landscape, where the cart and its occupant play a very minor role." The painting was originally dated 1865 by Monet.  However, correspondence by painter Alexandre Dubourg points to a later date of 1867.  In {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=80}}, Eliza Rathbone notes that the date is disputed by scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have only seen him once. It was in the winter, during several days of snow, when communications were virtually at a standstill. It was cold enough to split stones. We noticed a foot-warmer, then an easel, then a man, swathed in three coats, his hands in gloves, his face half-frozen. It was M. Monet, studying a snow effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|1988|p=137}} Published in October 1868, but the anecdote is thought to refer to the previous winter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'', Monet avoided the usual hunting genre and motifs used by Courbet. Instead, he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing the number of shades. Monet chose an [[earth tone]] color scheme and increased the number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on the snow.  Monet followed ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.

==First Étretat campaign==
In 1867, Monet's girlfriend, Camille Doncieux (1847&amp;ndash;1879), gave birth to their son Jean in Paris. Lacking money, Monet returned to his father's house in [[Sainte-Adresse]] and lived with his aunt, leaving Doncieux and their child in Paris. Monet married Doncieux in 1870. Mme. Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in Étretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in Étretat in October, with Doncieux in the role of muse and life model.&lt;ref name="cdm2"/&gt; By December, Monet was in great spirits, "surrounded by everything that I love", and began to focus on painting. In a letter to [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841&amp;ndash;1870), Monet wrote:

[[File:The Luncheon by Claude Monet - Städel - Frankfurt am Main - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Luncheon'' (1868). Camille and son Jean in Étretat.&lt;ref&gt;For an extended discussion of ''The Luncheon'' (''Le Dejeuner'') and how it fits into the timeline of the first Étretat campaign, see: Wagner, Anne M. (1994) "Why Monet gave up figure painting." ''Art Bulletin'' '''74''' (4): 612. {{issn|0004-3079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;I spend my time out in the open, on the shingle beach when the weather is bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the countryside which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.&lt;ref name="Gedo88"&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=88}}. See also: George, Serge (1996). ''Claude Monet''. Masterworks Series. Ramboro Books. p. 14. {{ISBN|1-56852-113-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he enjoyed living with Camille and Jean in Étretat, Monet preferred to paint alone in the countryside. He told Bazille:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't you think that directly in nature and alone one does better?...I've always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always been better. One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, I myself, personally.&lt;ref&gt;Wildenstein, I, 425-26: letter 44, Dec. 1868 as quoted in Isaacson 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his time in Étretat, Monet completed three paintings of fishing boats,&lt;ref&gt;Includes ''Fishing Boats, Calm Weather'' (Bateaux de Pêche, temps calme) (W 123) and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126). See also Rouart 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; one of a rural road,&lt;ref&gt;''Lane in Normandy'' (W 128).&lt;/ref&gt; and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, ''The Magpie'' ([[Wildenstein Index Number|W]] 133).&lt;ref name="Laclotte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laclotte|first=Michel|year=1986|title=Painting in the Musée d'Orsay|publisher=Scala Publications|isbn=0-935748-72-5}} See also footnote 14 as cited in Herbert 1996, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, ''The Magpie'' is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|May|1999}}: "Over the course of 30 winters, he [Monet] executed some 140 snowy views"; Moffett et al. 1999, p. 55: "...Monet painted the largest number of winter scenes (more than 140) and is the best known impressionist painter of effets de neige. As Monet took advantage of most significant snowfalls, his output of winter landscapes was often more sporadic, with occasional bursts of activity followed by periods without production..."&lt;/ref&gt; the largest in its class.&lt;ref&gt;Myers 1998: "...his largest winter painting..."; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}: "It is Monet's largest and most ambitious snowscape, an essay about light and shadow on snow."&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of the snow scene depicted in ''The Magpie'' is unknown.{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=41}} [[Ralph T. Coe]] proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in [[Honfleur]].{{sfn|Coe|1957|p=382}}

==Rejection by the Salon==
Monet submitted ''The Magpie'' and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126) to the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1869.&lt;ref name="Gedo91"&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both paintings were rejected in April.{{sfn|Tinterow|Loyrette|1994|p=322}} Critic Paul Richard said that the jurors rejected the painting as "too common and too coarse".{{sfn|Richard|1998}} Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Musée d'Orsay, ''Claude Monet The Magpie'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet told French novelist [[Arsène Houssaye]] (1815&amp;ndash;1896), "This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in spite of my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me."&lt;ref name="Butler145"&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, ''The Magpie'' was acquired by the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?nnumid=715|title=Musée d'Orsay: Notice d'Oeuvre|publisher=|quote=1984, acquis par les musées nationaux pour le musée d'Orsay (comité du 08/11/1984, conseil du 14/11/1984, arrêté du 14/12/1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=13}}: "Visitor surveys and sales of postcard and reproductions indicate that it is the most popular single image in the museum"; Also see {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
In the painting, a black magpie is perched on a gate in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]] as sunlight falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Rothkopf in {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Mathieu|1987|p=78}}: "In the absence of any human figure, the central feature of the painting is the black bird perched on the gate, which is filled with an almost magical significance".&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Howard of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] called the painting "an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites of the sky and landscape".&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1989, ''Monet'', p. 33 as quoted in {{harvnb|Meynell|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Lynn Orr, then of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]], noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orr|1994|p=18}}: "...qualities of light characteristic of different times of day and in different atmospheric conditions."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unusual weather phenomena, such as snow and mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the chromatic appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as ''The Magpie'', one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under the combination of a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.{{sfn|Orr|1994|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Magpie'' is an early example of Monet's investigation of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the [[complementary color]]s of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives the impression of a blue-violet color,&lt;ref name="rcm3"&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effect of [[simultaneous contrast]]. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and [[Colorfulness|desaturating]] the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardin|1988|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Schlichting|1999|pp=5–6}}; {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of Impressionism, art historian [[John Rewald]] observed that artists used snowscapes to "investigate the problem of shadows".{{sfn|Rewald|1961|p=228}} The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;After scrutinizing the effects of light and color on forms, the Impressionists concluded that ''local color''—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified by the quality of the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.{{sfn|Kleiner|2009|p=824}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Monet's use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in the 19th century. German scientist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749&amp;ndash;1832) published one of the first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643&amp;ndash;1727) in his treatise on ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786&amp;ndash;1889) expanded on Goethe's theory with ''The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors'' (1839).&lt;ref name="cdm2"&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the [[art world]]. It is generally thought that [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roque (1996) questions whether the Impressionists were aware of Chevreul's law of simultaneous contrast. Aside from Pissarro and Seurat, Roque can find no evidence that the Impressionists knew Chevreul's work directly. However, Backhaus et al. (1998) point out that it was possible the early Impressionists were familiar with the work of [[Eugène Delacroix]], who was intimate with Chevreul's color theories. It is generally accepted that as early as the 1860s, Monet was familiar with Delacroix's work and was influenced by his use of color.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Seurat]] (1859&amp;ndash;1891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of [[pointillism|chromatic division]], a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist [[Ogden Rood]] (1831&amp;ndash;1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roque|1996|pp=26–39}}.

==Related work==
Monet's series of 11 paintings depicting ''The Bridge at Argenteuil'' (1874) also explored the use of colored shadows in its portrayal of the blue and purple shadow on the top portion of the bridge.{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=12}} Over the years, Monet became more and more obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in ''[[Camille Monet on Her Deathbed]]'' (1879), noting the "blue, yellow, grey tones". Monet told his friend, French statesman [[Georges Clemenceau]] (1841&amp;ndash;1929), that he spent the time "focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clemenceau|first=Georges|year=1926|title=Claude Monet: Les Nymphéas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camille died from cancer at the age of 32. After her death, Monet largely ceased painting people, focusing instead on natural landscapes.{{sfn|Meyers|2011|p=75}} Monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with ''[[Grainstacks Snow Effect]]'' (1891).{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=26}}

The casting controversy generated significant response from the Asian American theater and artistic community, particularly because similar controversies have occurred in the past, as when [[Jonathan Pryce]] was cast to play the [[Eurasia]]n lead in the musical, ''[[Miss Saigon]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Lowe, Chinese Pirate Productions, A Response to the Nightingale Casting Controversy at the La Jolla Playhouse, http://chinesepirateproductions.blogspot.com/2012/07/a-response-to-nightingale-casting.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Chang, In a place called Naboo, or mythical China. http://changinator.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/in-a-place-called-naboo-or-mythical-china/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Ho, Deja Vu All Over Again - The Nightingale and Miss Saigon, {{cite web |url=http://www.scriptenabler.com/isaachowriter/?p=426 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120092531/http://www.scriptenabler.com/isaachowriter/?p=426 |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Choy, La Jolla's 'Nightingale' Doesn't Sing and Apology Doesn't Sway Many APIAs, Hyphen Magazine, http://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/archive/2012/07/la-jollas-nightingale-doesnt-sing-and-apology-doesnt-sway-many-apias&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian American theater leaders react to 'Nightingale' controversy, http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-asian-american-nightingale-la-jolla-playhouse-20120718,0,7027101.story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KPBS, Casting Controversy Shadows La Jolla Playhouse's 'Nightingale', KPBS, http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jul/18/casting-controversy-shadows-la-jolla-playhouses-ni/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post, Asian Actors Not Hired to Play Roles In Production Set in Ancient China, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/03/latest-conversations-cast_n_1739990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During a public forum to address the debate, the idea for which having been generated by a letter of protest from the Asian American Performers' Action Coalition, [[Christopher Ashley]], the current Artistic Director of the La Jolla Playhouse, stated that it was his effort to follow a [[Multiracial|multi-ethnic]] casting principle for the play.&lt;ref&gt;Angry Asian Man, Panel Discussion at La Jolla Playhouse, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2012/07/when-st-got-real-at-la-jolla-playhouse.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angry Asian Man, Talk Back on the Nightingale Casting Controversy, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2012/07/talk-back-on-nightingale-casting.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley and director [[Moises Kaufman]] both expressed an understanding and acknowledgement of the criticisms, and clarified their ongoing focus, through the play's series of workshops, to explore multiple ways of telling the story through a [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] lens. Kaufman later told the [[Los Angeles Times]] that his intention was to combine elements of both Eastern and Western cultures and that he was open to a version of the show with an all-Asian cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/nightingale-asian-american-actors_n_1686270.html|title='Nightingale' Casting Controversy: Asian American Actors Criticize Lack Of Asian Actors|last=Kavner|first=Lucas|date=2012-07-19|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/24/entertainment/la-et-cm-critics-notebook-la-jolla-playhouse-nightingale-20120723|title=Critic's Notebook: real world concerns about a fantasy 'Nightingale'|last=McNulty|first=Charles|date=2012-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking from the audience, book writer [[Steven Sater]] addressed the issue in depth. He stated that the play, based on the [[Danish culture|Danish]] fairy tale [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|''The Nightingale'']] which is written by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and set in [[ancient China]], had gone through seven workshops "in a number of directions with a number of directors" over the course of its development, with each exploring his overall vision of the piece. He described his vision as comprising a blend of cultures with a focus on the mythical elements and heritage of the fable on which it was based, in lieu of traditional realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/theater/sdut-taking-flight-2012jul14-htmlstory.html|title='Nightingale' takes flight at La Jolla Playhouse|last=Hebert|first=James|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the show's first workshop took place at the O'Neill Conference and utilized a multi-cultural cast, including an [[African Americans|African-American]] actress playing the Empress Dowager and an [[Indian Americans|Indian-American]] actor playing the Young Emperor, which Sater described as "a beautiful casting choice at the time" and demonstrative of the play being "always a story about enlightenment."

In 2007, the play was workshopped at the [[American Conservatory Theater]] in [[San Francisco]] with director [[James Lapine]], and utilized an all-Asian cast. Sater acknowledged the significant part in the show's development process that this particular workshop played, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a beautiful workshop of the piece. But we all came out of it feeling a number of things, one of which was that we felt, as white creators, we would not presume to know, or to tell, the story of Asia. We felt that the music which existed for the piece, and the storytelling, which more than anything else is informed by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], really, is my influence, and coming from a Danish telling of the story. I wanted to tell a story that reflected the world in which I live, which is multi-cultural, and multi-ethnic. I still feel this.&lt;ref name="chinataiwanjapan"&gt;{{Citation|last=chinataiwanjapan|title=La Jolla Playhouse Open Forum Part 6 of 7|date=2012-07-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDA4-7QVgFs|accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the forum, Sater acknowledged the sociopolitical issues arising out of the "longstanding inequities of the system in American theater" and the need "as an artist of social consciousness to be mindful of those issues and to address them." He stated, "When I began work on this show, it was in 2001. It was in the wake of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and what spoke to me in this story was the way ''The Song of the Human Heart'' could bring down the walls that divide us." Sater also expanded on his influences in writing the play, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I also have to address what's in my heart, and my artistic vision for this piece. I think if art is anything, it exists to bring out the humanity in all of us and that is what we're trying to tell in the song of this bird, the nightingale, who brings out the humanity in a man whose heart has been closed and turned cold. We did not set out to do an all-Asian cast, an all-Asian version, and then give up on that idea. Rather, it's something we explored, as this cast is something we're exploring, on a piece that remains to be finished. I was writing for a vision that was in my mind, and that vision always was, and remains to be, multi-cultural, and multi-ethnic; and however imperfect its realization here may be, that's the vision I continue to embrace for the piece.&lt;ref name="chinataiwanjapan"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Composer [[Duncan Sheik]] stated in an interview after the panel that the discussion had "affected my thinking of the show. My head is spinning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/23/entertainment/la-et-cm-heated-exchanges-at-la-jolla-playhouse-over-nightingale-casting-20120722|title=Heated exchanges at La Jolla Playhouse over multicultural casting [Updated]|last=Ng|first=David|date=2012-07-23|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the musical was workshopped at Vassar's [[Powerhouse Theater]] with a multi-ethnic cast (also directed by Kaufman).

{{Nanjing Massacre}}
'''''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II''''' is a [[Bestseller|bestselling]] 1997 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Iris Chang]] about the 1937–1938 [[Nanking Massacre]], the massacre and atrocities committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after it captured [[Nanjing]], then capital of [[Republic of China|China]], during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It describes the events leading up to the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book presents the view that the [[Japanese government]] has not done enough to redress the atrocities. It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to [[Western world|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischangmemorialfund.org/A_Brief_Biography_of_Iris_Chang.pdf|title=A Brief Biography of Iris Chang|publisher=Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WW II in Asia|accessdate=2007-07-27|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805185413/http://www.irischangmemorialfund.org/A_Brief_Biography_of_Iris_Chang.pdf|archivedate=2007-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received both acclaim and criticism by the public and by academics. It has been praised as a work that "shows more clearly than any previous account" the extent and brutality of the episode,&lt;ref name="KirbyForward"&gt;Forward by William C. Kirby, in: {{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time it was criticized as "seriously flawed" and "full of misinformation and harebrained explanations".&lt;ref name="Fogel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joshua A.

The book prompted [[AOL]] executive [[Ted Leonsis]] to fund and produce ''[[Nanking (2007 film)|Nanking]]'', a 2007 [[documentary film]] about the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/30/AR2006073000026.html|title=Ted Leonsis Takes a Sharp Turn|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2006-07-31|accessdate=2007-07-22 | first=Thomas | last=Heath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
When Iris Chang was a child, she was told by her parents, who had escaped with their families from [[China]] to [[Taiwan]] and then to the United States after [[World War II]], that during the [[Nanking Massacre]], the Japanese "sliced babies not just in half but in thirds and fourths." In the introduction of ''The Rape of Nanking,'' she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre "remained buried in the back of [her] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil." When she searched the local public libraries in her school and found nothing, she wondered why no one had written a book about it.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking7-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of the Nanking Massacre entered Chang's life again almost two decades later when she learned of producers who had completed documentary films about it. One of the producers was Shao Tzuping, who helped produce ''Magee's Testament'', a film that contains footage of the Nanking Massacre itself, shot by the [[missionary]] [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]].&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~nanking/html/proposal.pdf|title=Proposal for The Nanking Conference at Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=2007-07-23|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110100610/http://www.princeton.edu/~nanking/html/proposal.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other producer was Nancy Tong, who, together with Christine Choy, produced and co-directed ''In The Name of the Emperor'', a film containing a series of interviews with Chinese, American, and Japanese citizens.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;  Chang began talking to Shao and Tong, and soon she was connected to a network of activists who felt the need to document and publicize the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking8-9"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking," pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1994, she attended a conference on the Nanking Massacre, held in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]], and what she saw and heard at the conference motivated her to write ''The Rape of Nanking.''&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/rape_of_nanking.html|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Group USA|accessdate=2007-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210146/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/rape_of_nanking.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As she wrote in the introduction to the book, while she was at the conference, she was "suddenly in a panic that this terrifying disrespect for death and dying, this reversion in human social evolution, would be reduced to a footnote of history, treated like a harmless glitch in a computer program that might or might not again cause a problem, unless someone forced the world to remember it."&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking10"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Chang spent two years on research for the book.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; She found source materials in the US, including diaries, films, and photographs of missionaries, journalists, and military officers who were in Nanjing at the time of the massacre.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking11"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, she traveled to Nanjing to interview survivors of the Nanking Massacre and to read Chinese accounts and confessions by Japanese army veterans.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/07/26/SC77214.DTL|title=Wars of Memory|publisher=SFGate|date=1998-07-26|accessdate=2007-07-21 | first=Charles | last=Burress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang did not, however, conduct research in Japan, and this left her vulnerable to criticisms on how she portrayed modern Japan in the context of how it deals with its World War II past.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;

Chang's research led her to make what one ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article called "significant discoveries" on the subject of the Nanking Massacre, in the forms of the diaries of two Westerners who were in Nanjing leading efforts to save lives during the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; One diary was that of John Rabe, a [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi Party]] member who was the leader of the Nanking Safety Zone, a [[demilitarized zone]] in Nanjing that Rabe and other Westerners set up to protect Chinese civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/NanjingMassacre/NMNR.html|title=Rabe's Records of "The Rape of Nanjing" Discovered|publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong|date=1996-09-26|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other diary belonged to Minnie Vautrin, the American missionary who saved the lives of about 10,000 women and children when she provided them with shelter in [[Ginling College]].&lt;ref name="Vautrin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~siupress/titles/s00_titles/hu_goddess.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070525134253/http://www.siu.edu/~siupress/titles/s00_titles/hu_goddess.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-25|title=American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking|publisher=Southern Illinois University|accessdate=2007-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diaries documented the events of the Nanking Massacre from the perspectives of their writers, and provided detailed accounts of atrocities that they saw, as well as information surrounding the circumstances of the Nanking Safety Zone. Chang dubbed Rabe the "[[Oskar Schindler]] of Nanking" and Vautrin the "[[Anne Frank]] of Nanking".&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt;  Rabe's diary is over 800 pages, and contains one of the most detailed accounts of the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PrAoHzoP1QkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA121&amp;lpg=RA1-PA121&amp;dq=%22john+rabe%22+diary+%22detailed+accounts%22|author=Malcolm Trevor|title=Japan: Restless Competitor|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=1-903350-02-6|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated into English, it was published in 1998 by [[Random House]] as ''[[The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rabe|title=The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe|publisher=Random House|year=1998|isbn=0-375-40211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vautrin's diary recounts her personal experience and feelings on the Nanking Massacre; in it, an entry reads, "There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/223038.stm|title=Scarred by history: The Rape of Nanjing|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-04-11|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used as source material by Hua-ling Hu for a biography of Vautrin and her role during the Nanking Massacre, entitled ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DH24Ad01.html|title=An American hero in Nanking|publisher=Asia Times|date=2002-08-24|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''The Rape of Nanking'' is structured into three main parts. The first uses a technique that Chang called "the [[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon perspective]]" to narrate the events of the Nanking Massacre, from three different perspectives:  that of the Japanese military, the Chinese victims, and the Westerners who tried to help Chinese civilians.  The second part concerns the postwar reaction to the massacre, especially that of the American and European governments. The third part of the book examines the circumstances that, Chang believed, have kept knowledge of the massacre out of public consciousness decades after the war.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking14-15"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atrocities===
The book depicted in detail the killing, torture, and rape that occurred during the Nanking Massacre. Chang listed and described the kinds of torture that were visited upon the residents, including [[live burial]]s, [[mutilation]], "death by fire", "death by ice", and "death by dogs". Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chang also described a killing contest amongst a group of Japanese soldiers to determine who could kill the fastest.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking83-88"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 83-88&lt;/ref&gt;  On the rape that occurred during the massacre, Chang wrote that "certainly it was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history." She estimated that the number of women raped ranged from 20,000 to as many as 80,000,&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking89"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 89. Chang's sources listed as: Catherine Rosair, ''For One Veteran, Emperor Visit Should Be Atonement''; George Fitch, ''Nanking Outrages''; Li En-han, ''Questions of How Many Chinese Were Killed by the Japanese Army in the Great Nanking Massacre''&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that women from all classes were raped, including [[Buddhist nun]]s.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking90"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 90. Chang's sources listed as: Hu Hua-ling, ''Chinese Women Under the Rape of Nanking''&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, rape occurred in all locations and at all hours,&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking90-91"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 90-91.

===Death toll===
Chang wrote of the death toll estimates given by different sources; Chinese military specialist Liu Fang-chu proposed a figure of 430,000; officials at the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] and the procurator of the District Court of Nanjing in 1946 stated at least 300,000 were killed; the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (IMTFE) judges concluded that more than 260,000 people were killed; Japanese historian Fujiwara Akira approximated 200,000; John Rabe, who "never conducted a systematic count and left Nanking in February", estimated only 50,000 to 60,000; and Japanese author [[Ikuhiko Hata]] argued the number killed was between 38,000 and 42,000.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking100"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book discussed the research of historian Sun Zhaiwei of the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences. In his 1990 paper, ''The Nanking Massacre and the Nanking Population'', Sun estimated the total number of people killed at 377,400. Using Chinese burial records, he calculated that the number of dead exceeded the figure of 227,400. He then added estimates totaling 150,000 given by Japanese Imperial Army Major Ohta Hisao in a confessional report about the Japanese army's disposal efforts of dead bodies, arriving at the sum of 377,400 dead.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking101"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang wrote that there is "compelling evidence" that the Japanese themselves, at the time, believed that the death toll may have been as high as 300,000. She cited a message that [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's foreign minister]] [[Kōki Hirota]] relayed to his contacts in [[Washington, DC]] in the first month of the massacre on January 17, 1938.  The message acknowledged that "not less than three hundred thousand Chinese civilians [were] slaughtered, many cases in cold blood."&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking103-104"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acclaim==
''The Rape of Nanking'' sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the U. S., and according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', received general critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=1|title=History's Shadow Foils Nanking Chronicle|publisher=The New York Times (article hosted by IrisChang.net)|date=1999-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iris Chang became an instant celebrity in the U.

The book received praise from news media. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that it was the "first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city", and that Chang "skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place". ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' described the book as "a crushing indictment of the Japanese army's behavior". The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it "a powerful new work of history and moral inquiry" and stated that "Chang takes great care to establish an accurate accounting of the dimensions of the violence."  ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote that it was a "compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten".&lt;ref name="MediaPraise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=14|title=Media Praise For The Rape of Nanking|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William C. Kirby]], Professor of History at [[Harvard University]], Chang "shows more clearly than any previous account just what [the Japanese] did", and that she "draws connections between the slaughter in Europe and in Asia of millions of innocents during World War II".&lt;ref name="KirbyForward" /&gt; Ross Terrill, an associate in research at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/author_detail.jsp?id=1000016300|title=Ross Terrill|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the book is "scholarly, an exciting investigation and a work of passion".&lt;ref name="Quotes"&gt;Quotes on the Jacket and Interior of - {{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice S.

==Criticism==
Joshua A. Fogel, at [[York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinajapan.org/fogel|title=Joshua A. Fogel|publisher=Sino-Japanese Studies|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the book is "seriously flawed" and "full of misinformation and harebrained explanations."&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt;  He suggested that the book "starts to fall apart" when Chang tries to explain why the massacre took place, as she repeatedly comments on "the Japanese psyche", which she sees as "the historical product of centuries of conditioning that all boil down to [[mass murder]]" even though in the introduction, she wrote that she would offer no "commentary on the Japanese character or the genetic makeup of a people who could commit such acts". Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's "lack of training as a historian" and another part was "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history".&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt; Fogel also writes: "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" of Japanese scholars.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt;

[[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]], a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor of history at [[Stanford University]], also pointed out that while Chang noted that "this book is not intended as a commentary on the Japanese character," she then wrote about the "'Japanese identity'—a bloody business, in her estimation, replete with martial competitions, samurai ethics, and the fearsome warriors' code of [[bushido]]", making the inference that "'the path to Nanking' runs through the very marrow of Japanese culture." Kennedy also suggested that "accusation and outrage, rather than analysis and understanding, are this book's dominant motifs, and although outrage is a morally necessary response to Nanjing, it is an intellectually insufficient one."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite magazine | author=David M. Kennedy | title=The Horror : Should the Japanese atrocities in Nanking be equated with the Nazi Holocaust? | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199804/nanking | magazine=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] | pages=110–116 | volume=281 | issue=4 |date=April 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy criticized Chang's accusation of "Western indifference" and "Japanese denial" of the massacre as "exaggerated", commenting that "the Western world in fact neither then nor later ignored the Rape of Nanking", "nor is Chang entirely correct that Japan has obstinately refused to acknowledge its wartime crimes, let alone express regret for them." Chang argues that Japan "remains to this day a renegade nation," having "managed to avoid the moral judgment of the civilized world that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in this nightmare time." However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliché of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by [[Ian Buruma]]'s ''The Wages of Guilt'' (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as "Germany remembers too much, Japan too little." Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese left has long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the [[Resolution to renew the determination for peace on the basis of lessons learned from history|1995 resolution]] of Japan's [[House of Councillors]] that expressed "deep remorse" (''fukai hansei'') for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear [[List of war apology statements issued by Japan|apologies]] (''owabi'') for Imperial Japan's offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

Roger B. Jeans, professor of history at [[Washington and Lee University]], referred to Chang's book as "half-baked history", and criticized her lack of experience with the subject matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In writing about this horrific event, Chang strives to portray it as an unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she undermines her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) at that time and uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck me about her argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to accept the fact of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal to come to terms with its past.'
&lt;ref name=Jeans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeans|first=Roger B.|date=January 2005|title=Victims or Victimizers?

Jeans continued what he calls "giving the lie to Iris Chang's generalizations about 'the Japanese'" by discussing the clashing interest groups within Japanese society over such things as museums, textbooks, and war memory.&lt;ref name=Jeans/&gt;

Robert Entenmann, professor of history at [[St. Olaf College]], criticized the work on the grounds that the "Japanese historical background Chang presents is clichéd, simplistic, stereotyped, and often inaccurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/history/faculty/entenmann.html|title=Robert Entenmann|publisher=St. Olaf College|accessdate=2007-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705141913/http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/history/faculty/entenmann.html|archivedate=2007-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Chang's treatment of modern Japanese reaction to the massacre, he writes that Chang seemed "unable to differentiate between some members of the ultranationalist fringe and other Japanese", and that "her own ethnic [[prejudice]] implicitly pervades her book." Stating that Chang's description of the massacre is "open to criticism", Entenmann further commented that Chang "does not adequately explain why the massacre occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewswc3.htm|title=Book review of ''The Rape of Nanking''|publisher=University of the West of England|accessdate=2007-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035132/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewswc3.htm|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly further criticized Chang for her "lack of attention to detail".{{#tag:ref|As examples of this lack of attention to detail, Kelly cited a number of errors such as incorrectly referring to Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Perry]] as "Commander" and writing [[Itô Nobufumi]] ([[:ja:伊藤述史|伊藤述史]])'s name as "Ito Nobufumo", without a [[circumflex]] on the letter ''o''.  As an example of "sheer sloppiness", Kelly cited Chang's sentence, "Another rape victim was found with a golf stick rammed into her", and noted that "(while) golfers do colloquially refer to their clubs as 'sticks'", the terms "golf club" or "the shaft of a golf club" should have been used.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal|author=Timothy M.

Sonni Efron of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' warned that the bitter row over Iris Chang's book may leave Westerners with the "misimpression" that little has been written in Japan about the Nanjing Massacre, when in fact the [[National Diet Library]] holds at least 42 books about the Nanjing massacre and Japan's wartime misdeeds, 21 of which were written by liberals investigating Japan's wartime atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanforum.hp.infoseek.co.jp/zheng/04/1122a.htm 我看张纯如《南京大屠杀》]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Efron noted that geriatric Japanese soldiers have published their memoirs and have been giving speeches and interviews in increasing numbers, recounting the atrocities they committed or witnessed. After years of government-enforced denial, Japanese middle school textbooks now carry accounts of the Nanjing massacre as accepted truth.&lt;ref name=once&gt;{{cite news | title=Once Again, Japan is at war over History | author=Sonni Efron | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 6, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baoshan1937-Asahi-01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original version of a photograph used by Chang—the accuracy of the caption in the book is disputed&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;]]
''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' staff writer Charles Burress wrote that Chang's quote of a secret telegram sent by Japan's foreign minister in 1938 was incorrectly cited as "compelling evidence" that Japanese troops killed at least 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt; According to Burress, the figure of 300,000 Chinese civilians killed actually came from a message sent by a British reporter, concerning deaths not only in Nanjing but in other places as well. Additionally, Burress questioned Chang's motivation for writing the book - whether she wrote it as an activist or as a historian, stating that the book "draws its emotional impetus" from her conviction to not let the Nanking Massacre be forgotten by the world.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;  Burress also cited [[Ikuhiko Hata]], a Japanese history professor at [[Nihon University]], who argued that 11 photos in the book were misrepresented or fake. One particular photo shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, and captioned as "The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution." Hata stated that the photo originally appeared in 1937 in a Japanese newspaper as part of a series of photos that showed peaceful scenes of Chinese villagers under Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;

Chang responded to Charles Burress's criticism in a letter written to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', but the letter was not published by the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vikingphoenix.com/public/rongstad/news/bamr/changletter.htm|title=San Francisco Chronicle refused to publish Iris Chang's rebuttal|publisher=VikingPhoenix.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305234642/http://www.vikingphoenix.com/public/rongstad/news/bamr/changletter.htm|archivedate=2001-03-05|date=1999-06-18|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the letter, she offered criticism of her own concerning Burress's article.&lt;ref name="ChangLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=9|title=Iris Chang's Letter to the San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang found a "disturbing tendency" by Burress to quote right-wing Japanese critics "without demanding evidence to back up their allegations". She argued that Ikuhiko Hata, a source cited by Burress, was not "regarded as a serious scholar" in either Japan or in the U. S., because he was a regular contributor to "ultra right-wing" Japanese publications. One such publication had published an article from a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] that argued that no [[gas chamber]]s were used in Germany to kill [[Jew]]s. This caused the parent publisher to shut down the publication. On Burress's criticism of her inaccurate photo captioning, Chang disputed the contention that the caption was wrong. She wrote that her book dealt with the "horror of the Japanese invasion of China", and that the caption reading "The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution" contained two statements of indisputable fact.

Chang also issued a rejoinder to Burress's argument that she incorrectly cited a telegram sent by Japan's foreign minister. She wrote that while the original figure of 300,000 Chinese civilian deaths in Nanjing was reported by a British reporter, this figure was cited in a message that Japan's foreign minister sent to his contacts in [[Washington, DC]]. Chang argued that figure's use by a high-ranking Japanese government official was evidence that the Japanese government recognized 300,000 as the number of Chinese civilian deaths. Finally, she criticized Burress for his "nitpick" of small details in order to draw attention away from the scope and magnitude of the Nanking Massacre, writing that such was a "common tactic" of Holocaust deniers.&lt;ref name="ChangLetter" /&gt;

==Reaction in Japan==
''The Rape of Nanking'' has caused controversy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070223a5.html|title=LDP-DPJ group plan to scrutinize 'Rape of Nanking'|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2007-02-23|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' staff writer, Sonni Efron, reported that Chang's flawed work was repeatedly cited by Japanese "ultranationalists" as evidence that any claim of massacre are baseless, and Japanese liberals, in turn "insist the massacre happened but allege that Chang's flawed scholarship damages their cause".&lt;ref name="CHGS"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://chgs.umn.edu/news/v3i1.html#nanjingmassacre|journal=CHGS Newsletter|publisher=University of Minnesota Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies|title=Nanjing Massacre Disputed Again!|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor David Askew of
[[Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University]] stated that Chang's work dealt a "severe blow" to the "Great Massacre School" of thought, which advocates for the validity of the findings at the [[Tokyo Trials]], the tribunal convened to try the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for crimes committed during World War II. Askew further argued that "the Great Massacre School has thus been forced into the (unusual) position of criticising a work that argues for a larger death toll."&lt;ref name="Askew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html|title=The Nanjing Incident|publisher=Electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies|date=2002-04-04|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''The Rape of Nanking'', Japanese critic [[Masaaki Tanaka]] had his 1987 book on Nanking translated into English. Entitled ''What Really Happened in Nanking: The Refutation of a Common Myth'', Tanaka stated in his introduction "I am convinced that [American researchers] will arrive at the realization that violations of international law of the magnitude alleged by Iris Chang in ''The Rape of Nanking'' (more than 300,000 murders and 80,000 rapes) never took place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critic disputes 'Rape of Nanking' in English translation of '87 work What Really Happened in Nanking--The Refutation of Common Myth |last=Anai|first=Ikuo|date=6 May 2001|publisher=''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' (Tokyo)|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang's book was not published in a translated Japanese language edition until December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ja:「ザ・レイプ・オブ・南京」の日本語版が出版 | url=http://j.people.com.cn/2007/12/17/jp20071217_81293.html | publisher=[[People's Daily]] | date=2007-12-17|accessdate=2007-12-18 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ザ・レイプ・オブ・南京—第二次世界大戦の忘れられたホロコースト. Translated by 巫召鴻. {{ISBN|4-88683-617-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with translation efforts surfaced immediately after a contract was signed for the Japanese publishing of the book. A Japanese literary agency informed Chang that several Japanese historians declined to review the translation, and that one professor backed out because of pressure placed on his family from "an unknown organization".&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes" /&gt;  According to Japan scholar Ivan P. Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanreview.net/interview_ivan_hall.htm|title=Ivan P.

They prevailed on Kashiwa Shobo, the contracted Japanese publisher of the book, to insist that Chang edit the book for "corrections" they wanted made, to delete photographs and alter maps, and to publish a rebuttal to Chang's book. Chang disagreed with the changes and, as a result, withdrew the Japanese publishing of the book.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op28.html|title=Japan and the U.S.: Sidelining the Heterodox|publisher=Japan Policy Research Institute|date=December 2002|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebuttal piece was nonetheless published as a book by [[Nobukatsu Fujioka]] and Shudo Higashinakano entitled ''A Study of 'The Rape of Nanking'''.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higashinakano" /&gt;

Shudo Higashinakano, a professor of intellectual history at [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University of Japan]], argued in ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' that the book was "pure baloney", that there was "no witness of illegal executions or murders", and that "there existed no 'Rape of Nanking' as alleged by the Tokyo Trial."&lt;ref name="Higashinakano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/e/nanking4.html |title=California State Assembly Should Indict the Atomic Bomb Droppings on Japan |publisher=Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History |date=1999-09-05 |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810191502/http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/e/nanking4.html |archivedate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He identified 90 historical factual errors in the first 64 pages of the book, some of which were corrected in the 1998 [[Penguin Books]] edition.&lt;ref name="Mistakes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/nanjing/errors.html |title=Thanks for correcting some mistakes |publisher=Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705013557/http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/nanjing/errors.html |archivedate=2007-07-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chang's death===
After publishing the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese [[Nationalism#Ultranationalism|ultranationalists]],&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; and threatening notes on her car and also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book "made Iris sad". Suffering from [[Clinical depression|depression]], Chang was diagnosed with [[brief reactive psychosis]] in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; She wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined.

[[File:Joan Jonas Vertical Roll.jpg|thumb|Still from ''Vertical Roll'']]
'''''Vertical Roll''''' is a 1972 [[video art]] piece by American video and [[performance art|performance]] artist [[Joan Jonas]]. It is a sequel to Jonas' first video work ''Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy''. Jonas' interfacing with the material grammar of video was significant to the late 1960s and early 1970s experimentation with new video technology. Among others, [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Nam June Paik]] and [[Peter Campus]] also contributed to the emergent material discourse of video art.

==The video==
Shot in [[Ace Gallery]] Los Angeles, Vertical Roll features Jonas performing a series of actions under her [[alter-ego]] ''Organic Honey'', the [[belly dancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.utah.edu/~klm6/3905/vertical_roll.html "Joan Jonas: Vertical Roll"], The University of Utah, Accessed 04-26-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot during one of the rehearsals for Jonas' ''Organic Honey'' performance, and while it is mostly based off the structure of a vertical roll it does contain some images from ''Visual Telepathy''.&lt;ref name=five10&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finklepearl|first1=Tom|last2=Jonas|first2=Joan|title=Joan Jonas:five works|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=Queens Museum of Art|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Jonas the video offered a new means to approach perception and offer "multiple and simultaneous points of view".&lt;ref name=five10/&gt; Vertical Roll provided Jonas a means to explore the disjunction between performance and a recording of that performance. She places a heavy emphasis on time, and both physical and mental space in her explanation of the work.

===The Vertical Roll===
''Vertical Roll'' combines both video and the performance space. As an installation alongside the ''Organic Honey'' performance it makes use of both live action and recorded video.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Hanhardt, "From Screen to Gallery: Cinema, Video and Installation Art Practices" in "American Art" Vol 22, No. 2., (The University of Chicago Press, Summer 2008), Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; The performance, on and off camera, plays on the disjunction between the two modes of presentation. Jonas' intentional mediation of "the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies"&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; causes the image being displayed to repeatedly travel vertically from the bottom of the screen to the top resulting in the "[[synch roll|vertical roll]]" for which the piece is titled. The vertical roll, in and of itself, is one "of the primary technical features of video".&lt;ref name=Crimp130&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=130|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonas' manipulation of the vertical hold function on a CRT monitor to mimic the vertical movement of film through a projector, placing the piece in clear dialog with the cinematic tradition.&lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"&gt;Martin Kremer, "Get rid of the Knots" in ''Afterall: A Journal of Art, Context, and Enquiry'', Issue 9 (Spring/Summer 2004), The University of Chicago Press on behalf of Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, University of the Arts London, p. 10-19&lt;/ref&gt; This dialog is seen in Jonas' technical handling of the video in which video "shifts have to become registered either by camera movement... or by cutting".&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krauss|first1=Rosalind|title=Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism|journal=October|date=1976|issue=1|pages=60–61|doi=10.2307/778507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast as an “electronic erotic seductress,” the multiple costumes and roles performed by Jonas critically examine the ever-changing, but consistently unequal roles of women. The ''Organic Honey'' videos showcased Jonas' early exploration into "the narcissistic qualities of video"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Finklepearl, Joan Jonas, ''Joan Jonas: Five Works'' eds. Warren Niesluchowski, Valerie Smith (New York: Queens Museum of Art, 2003), p. 6, Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; and would later provide the foundation for proceeding video works. The camera [[gaze]]s at Jonas, [[Feminist film theory#the gaze and female spectatorship|implicating]] the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Jonas presents her collection of images through multiple perspectives that are dependent "in terms of the camera's distance and its orientation to horizontal ground".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; The de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the constant wiping away of the images on screen which renders the images recognizable but gives them the illusion of being invisible. The illusion created is perceptual. it is "one of a continuous dissolve through time and space".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; ''Vertical Roll'' introduces the paradigm of the body existing in a space between the video and the monitor. The monitor becomes a metaphorical stand-in for the reel and this metaphor is only further enhanced through the continuous action of the vertical roll which references the "physical reality of the tape deck".&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a "disjunctive self portrait" by the [[Electronic Arts Intermix]], the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Roll" Electronic Arts Intermix, 2013. http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===De-synchronization===
The disparity between the video monitor, the repeating percussive sound, and the on-screen image are examples of the use of de-synchronization as a conceptual tool for revealing the contingency of [[Sensory analysis#Perception|perceptual]] experience. This disparity relies on the instability of Jonas' images juxtaposed with their cementation as visible through the use of the video medium.&lt;ref name=Crimp9&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crimp|first1=Douglas|title=Sloan Jonas: Scripts and Descriptions|date=1982|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|page=9|chapter=De-Synchronization in Joan Jonas's Performances'}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the perceptual confusions created in Jonas' ''Vertical Roll'' can be seen in the sequence where "Jonas bangs a spoon against a mirror, creating the illusions of a relationship between the sounds and the image disturbance".&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; Jonas matches action and sound to the timing of the vertical roll &lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"&gt;Bruce Kurtz, [http://vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VidBeingInvented.pdf "Video is Being Invented"] in "Arts Magazine" (1973), p. 41,Accessed 27-04-2015&lt;/ref&gt; which creates the idea of simultaneous occurrences in the video.

Temporality is made a part of ''Vertical Roll'' through the disjunctive nature of the video, and this sense of time is "understood as propulsion towards an end."&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Time is visualized through a constant wiping away of the image. Through de-synchronization, the artist posed a challenge to the supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of experience from the senses, potentially uncovering pretenses or dispositions that inform the processing of sensory data.&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt; The images on screen seem to decompose in their constant scanning from the bottom to the top of the screen.&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt; Jonas further enhances the effects of de-synchronization through her movements which are "choreographed in relation to the action of the vertical roll."&lt;ref name=Crimp9/&gt;

Jonas explores the notion of the frame extensively in ''Vertical Roll'' as an expression of “standing one’s ground against external forces.” &lt;ref name="Martin Kremer 2004 p. 10-19"/&gt; By recording  a CRT playing back video, Jonas creates a frame within a frame, and then creating the image that the frame is collapsing in on itself every half second or so by adjusting the vertical roll on the monitor. While visually excluding the outside world nearly the entire piece, sounds accompanying the crashing frame dictate some kind of external operator attempting to beat along with the CRT’s image, expanding the scope of the piece beyond the video. In the concluding moments of her video Jonas breaks the frame entirely when she inserts her head in between the camera and the monitor, entering from the outer edge of the frame, destroying the symbolic wall the camera creates and adding another level of spatial fragmentation and self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Artists' Video: An International Guide|last = Zippay|first = Lori|publisher = Electronic Arts Intermix|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of Jonas' head is an act of agency independent of the vertical roll. It renders the vertical roll visible and reveals the space of the video to the viewer,&lt;ref name=Crimp130/&gt; shattering its perceptual illusion. The disjunction caused by the concluding moments of this video highlights the implications of video presented, or displayed, in the space of the monitor.&lt;ref name="Video is Being Invented"/&gt;

Jonas claims that Vertical Roll finds a likeness to [[The Garden of Forking Paths]] a work by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref name=five10/&gt;

'''''Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?''''' is the fifth [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures episodes|story]] of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.  It forms the seventh and eighth episodes of the show's first series.  The first episode was aired on the CBBC channel on 29 October 2007, and the second on 5 November.

==Plot==

===Part 1===
[[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah Jane]] receives a puzzle box from a Veron Soothsayer, with the instruction to give it to the person she most trusts. Sarah Jane gives [[Maria Jackson]] the puzzle box. A meteor is on collision course with Earth, and Sarah Jane has set up, but not yet activated via Mr Smith, a force field to deflect the meteor. The next morning Maria wakes to find that Sarah Jane and [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]] have gone missing, but no one besides Maria knows who Sarah Jane or Luke Smith are. A woman called [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Andrea Yates|Andrea Yates]] has apparently taken Sarah Jane's place.&lt;ref name="wk45"&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC Program Information, week 45 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk45/mon.shtml#mon_sja | publisher = BBC Press Office | accessdate = 10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigating, Maria finds a 1964 newspaper report, stating that a thirteen-year-old Sarah Jane Smith died after falling off a pier, where she was playing with her friend, Andrea Yates. As Maria watches, the names of the deceased and the survivor on the report switch before her eyes and, at one point, hears Sarah Jane's disembodied voice calling out to her. When Maria goes to Andrea to talk to her about the report, Andrea suddenly panics and unceremoniously shows Maria out before she rushes to her attic, where she takes out a second puzzle box. She now remembers a mysterious hooded figure, who appears and offers to make Maria disappear. After Andrea accepts, he dispatches a small alien, a Graske, who captures Maria just after Alan picks up the first puzzle box, which Maria dropped during her escape from the alien. When Alan's ex-wife comes round, he discovers she cannot remember their daughter. Meanwhile, Maria escapes from the Graske and finds herself on a beach promenade near two girls. They introduce themselves as Andrea Yates and Sarah Jane Smith.

===Part 2===

After failing to dissuade Andrea and Sarah Jane from going to the pier, Maria is recaptured by the Graske and taken to join the adult Sarah Jane on a white misty plain, [[limbo]]. The mysterious figure explains he has removed Sarah Jane from Earth's timeline so the meteor will destroy it and create the chaos on which he feeds; the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] will be his next target.

Alan accompanies Chrissie to Andrea's birthday party. Remembering Maria's suspicions, he questions Andrea, who takes him to the attic and sorrowfully reveals the truth. When Andrea fell off the pier and Sarah Jane was unable to save her, a voice offered to switch the girls' places and Andrea, terrified, accepted. The figure appeared and gave Andrea the puzzle box, then removed himself from her memory; Maria’s questions made Andrea remember the deal she made with the figure. Alan is now chased into the street by the Graske but he knocks it down, then uses its device to bring back Maria.

They return to the attic, where Sarah Jane appears in the mirror and explains to Andrea that witnessing her death gave her the resolve to fight pointless deaths herself. When the figure reappears (called “the Trickster” by Alan), Andrea explains she has changed her mind about the deal and throws her puzzle box at the mirror, smashing both. Back in 1964 Andrea falls to her death. Sarah Jane and Luke reappear in the attic and activate Mr Smith. The party guests, including Clyde and Chrissie, have learned from television news about the incoming meteor, and are relieved to see it suddenly diverted from its fall. The episode ends with Alan demanding an explanation of his daughter’s involvement with aliens and supercomputers.

=== Continuity ===
* The [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (0–9, A–G)#Graske|Graske]] also featured in the interactive episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', "[[Attack of the Graske]]". Sarah Jane states that there was Graske activity on Earth a couple of years ago, possibly referring to that episode.
* Sarah mentions previous times she saved the Earth and thwarted alien invasions, including the Bane ("[[Invasion of the Bane]]"), the [[Slitheen]] (''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]'') and the Gorgons (''[[Eye of the Gorgon]]''). She also mentions that she helped defeat the Patriarchs of the Tin Vagabond. The Church of the Tin Vagabond was previously mentioned in the 2006 ''Doctor Who'' episode, "[[The Satan Pit]]".
* [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q–Z)#The Trickster|The Trickster]] threatens the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] when in limbo. This is the second time that the Doctor has been explicitly named in the series, the first being in ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]''. The Trickster makes good on this threat in the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]", when a creature from "[his] brigade" assaults [[Donna Noble]].
* Sarah Jane's address is identified as 13 Bannerman Road, as it is throughout the later series; it had been 21 Bannerman Road in the preceding two serials,&lt;ref&gt;The Smiths' front door bears the number 21 in ''[[Eye of the Gorgon]]'', and Sarah Jane's business card shows her address as 21 Bannerman Road in ''[[Warriors of the Kudlak]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the sign on the brick wall next to the Smiths' driveway still says 21.

==Outside references==
*Clyde describes the meteor coming to Earth like something out of the film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''.
*When questioned about Maria, Andrea mentions [[Hail Mary|"Ave Maria"]] and [[Maria Callas]].
*As in many previous ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes, [[BBC News 24]] releases 'Breaking News' during the serial, although again without the [[BBC]] logo present.
*The fictional [[Triffid]]s are mentioned.
*The song "[[(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me]]" is heard at Andrea's party.
*[[The Kinks]] song "[[You Really Got Me]]" is heard on a radio when Maria arrives in the 1960s.
*When Maria is on the Internet on her laptop, she goes on [[bebo]].
*The title is a direct reference to the book and film ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (novel)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''
*The puzzle box featured in the episodes bears a strong mechanical resemblance to the puzzle box from the [[Hellraiser]] film series.

==Cast notes==
* Jane Asher previously portrayed the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]'s granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] in the 1994 [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] [[Doctor Who spoofs#"Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman?" (1994)|spoof]] ''[[Whatever Happened to ..?|Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman]]''.
*Paul Marc Davis previously appeared as the Futurekind Chieftain in the ''Doctor Who'' 2007 episode "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]", and later as the Cowled Leader in the 2008 ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Exit Wounds (Torchwood)|Exit Wounds]]" and Corakinus, the king of the Shadow Kin in ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]''.

==Reception==
The story received several positive reviews. Mark Wright, writing on ''[[The Stage]]'''s "TV Today" blog, stated that the series, while usually "wholly satisfying and entertaining", "achieves true greatness" with the first part of ''Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?''
