"'''A calorie is a calorie'''" is a tautology used to convey the speaker's conviction that the concept of the "calorie" is in fact a sufficient way to describe energy content of food.

The [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] phrase means that regardless of the form of [[food calorie]] a person consumes (whether a carbohydrate, protein or fat calorie) the energetic value of such a calorie, is identical to any other. One dietary calorie contains 4,184 joules of [[energy]]. With this knowledge, it is easy to assume that all calories have equal value.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://authoritynutrition.com/6-reasons-why-a-calorie-is-not-a-calorie/|title=A calorie is NOT a calorie|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Authority Nutrition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, good [[human nutrition]] measures foods for other values than just energy in calories.{{Cite web|url=Richard_D{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== History ==
In 1878, German nutritionist [[Max Rubner]] crafted what he called the "isodynamic law".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=What Really Makes Us Fat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/what-really-makes-us-fat.html|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law claims that the basis of nutrition is the [[Conservation of energy|exchange of energy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biochmeical Journal, Volume 16|year=1922|publisher=Biochemical Society|page=751|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxMkAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isodynamic+law}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to the study of obesity in the early 1900s by [[Carl von Noorden (pathologist)|Carl von Noorden]]. Von Noorden had two theories about what caused people to develop obesity. The first simply avowed Rubner's notion that "a calorie is a calorie". The second theorized that [[obesity]] development depends on how the body partitions calories for either use or storage.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;   Since 1925, a calorie has been defined in terms of the joule. The definition of a calorie changed in 1948, which became one calorie is equal to approximately 4,2 joules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrews|first=A.|date=2015|title=Calorie|url=http://ipacez.nd.edu.au/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/acbvet/calorie/0|journal=Black's Veterinary Dictionary|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related concept of "calorie in, calorie out" is contested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=The Scientist and the Stairmaster|url=http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/index3.html|accessdate=8 May 2013|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite having become a commonly held and frequently referenced belief in [[nutritionism]], the implications associated with "a calorie is a calorie" are still being debated.&lt;ref name=Health.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Sass|first=Cynthia|title=Why Calorie Counts are Wrong: 6 Diet Myths, Busted|url=http://news.health.com/2013/02/07/why-calorie-counts-are-wrong-6-diet-myths-busted/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=health.com|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gann|first=Carrie|title=For Calories, It's All About Quality Over Quantity, Harvard Study Says|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/calorie-calorie-harvard-study-compares-popular-weight-loss/story?id=16654506|work=ABC News|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVA&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesheim|first=Malden|title=Is a Calorie a Calorie?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/is-a-calorie-a-calorie.html|work=NOVA|publisher=PBS|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wisdom and [[Starvation response|effects of skipping meals]] in an attempt to limit caloric intake is also still largely debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeratsky |first=Katherine|title=Breakfast: How does it help weight control?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN01119|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breakfast is 'most important meal'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2824987.stm|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinagel |first=Monica|title=Is Skipping Breakfast Bad For You?|url=http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/is-skipping-breakfast-bad-for-you.aspx|publisher=Nutrition Diva|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calorie counting ==
Calorie amounts found on food labels are based on the [[Atwater system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Leonard|date=1944|title=The Atwater system of calculating the caloric value of diets|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/28/6/443.extract|journal=440 - 443|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of the system is disputed, despite no real proposed alternatives. For example, a 2012 study by a USDA scientist concluded that the measured energy content of a sample of almonds was 32% lower than the estimated Atwater value.&lt;ref name="Nuts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nesheim, Nestle|first=Malden, Marion|title=Is a Calorie a Calorie?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/is-a-calorie-a-calorie.html|accessdate=2013-05-08|newspaper=PBS NOVA|date=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is known that some calories are lost in waste, without ever having been chemically converted or stored. The driving mechanism behind caloric intake is absorption, which occurs largely in the [[Digestion#Small intestine|small intestine]] and distributes nutrients to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries by means of [[osmosis]], [[diffusion]] and [[active transport]]. Fat, in particular is emulsified by [[bile]] produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder where it is released to the small intestine via the [[bile duct]]. A relatively lesser amount of absorption, composed primarily of water, occurs in the [[Digestion#Large intestine|large intestine]].

== Research ==

=== Wake Forest University Research ===
In 2007, a group of [[Wake Forest University]] researchers published a report from a six-year [[longitudinal study]] in which they fed two groups of monkeys the same number of calories and dietary levels of fat, with the only difference being that one group was fed foods higher in [[trans fat]]. The high trans fat group gained 30% more [[belly fat]] compared to their lower trans fat counterparts.&lt;ref name=Monkeys&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=Kylie|author2=Kate L. Jones |author3=Janet Sawyer |author4=Kathryn Kelley |author5=J. Jeffrey Carr |author6=Janice D. Wagner |author7=Lawrence L. Rudel|title=Trans Fat Diet Induces Abdominal Obesity and Changes in Insulin Sensitivity in Monkeys|journal=Obesity|date=July 2007|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1675–1684|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.200|pmid=17636085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed do affect [[body weight]].&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;

The physical activities of the monkeys were not taken into account during this study.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The sample size was 38.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Harvard University Research ===
In 2011, a group of [[Harvard University]] researchers published the results of a study in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] that followed 120,877 highly educated men and women over a period of 12 to 20 years. The study focused on factors that influence [[weight gain]] including diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol intake and television watching. Participants began the study as healthy adults. Every two years, they would complete detailed questionnaires about their eating and other habits. The results found that an array of factors influenced the fluctuation of a person's weight. The average participant gained about one pound per year. Among the results of the study, it was found that the types of foods people ate had a larger effect on weight gain than physical activity.&lt;ref name=Nurse&gt;{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Jane E.|title=Still County Calories? Your Weight-Loss Plan May Be Outdated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers "Consumption of processed foods that are higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain." and "These results suggest that future policies and research efforts to prevent obesity should consider food structure and processing as potentially relevant dietary metrics."&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mozaffarian |first=Dariush|author2=Tao Hao |author3=Eric B. Rimm |author4=Walter C. Willett |author5=Frank B. Hu |title=Changes in Diet and Lifestyle and Long-Term Weight Gain in Women and Men|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1014296|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014296?query=TOC#t=articleTop|accessdate=7 May 2013|volume=364|issue=25|pages=2392–404|pmid=21696306|pmc=3151731|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead author of the study concluded in an interview that trying to count calories, in an effort to lose weight, would be futile unless one is examining the kinds of calories being consumed.&lt;ref name="Nurse"/&gt;

== Facts ==
One dietary Calorie contains 4184 joules of energy. The human body is a highly complex biochemical system that undergoes processes which regulate energy balance. The metabolic pathways for protein are less efficient than the metabolic pathways for carbohydrates and fat.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Protein contains four calories per gram, although a large part of the calories are lost as heat when metabolised by the body.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"/&gt;

It may be easy to consume 500 calories worth of ice cream or chocolate in one sitting, although it may be difficult to eat 500 calories of eggs or carrot in one sitting.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"/&gt;

=== Boston Children's Hospital Clinical Trial ===
In 2012, the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] published the results of a [[clinical trial]] performed by a group of researchers that investigated whether dietary composition affected weight loss.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebbeling |first=Cara|author2=anis F. Swain |author3=Henry A. Feldman |author4=William W. Wong |author5=David L. Hachey |author6=Erica Garcia-Lago |author7=David S. Ludwig |title=Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=307|issue=23|pages=2627–2634|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.6607|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154#COMMENT|accessdate=25 April 2013|pmid=22735432|pmc=3564212|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study tracked 21 individuals. The individuals first lost at least 12.5% of their body weight, and were then placed on one of three different dietary regimens:

# A diet high in protein and fat, but with fewer carbohydrates
# A diet low in fat, emphasizing whole grains, fruit and vegetables
# A diet with a low [[glycemic index]], focusing on the type of carbohydrates consumed

The results showed that the first group burned the most calories, but also displayed increased markers of [[Oxidative stress|stress]] and [[inflammation]] in the body, which can lead to [[cardiovascular disease]], among [[Diseases of affluence|other health problems]]. The second group burned fewer calories than the other two groups, and also displayed certain metabolic indicators that typically precede weight gain. The third group burned a reasonable number of calories, but notably did not display increased markers of disease-causing stress. The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed does affect the number of calories burned by an individual. This conclusion is in direct contrast to what the commonly held belief implies.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">The '''agent systems reference model''' (ASRM) is a layered, abstract description for [[multiagent systems]].  As such, the [[reference model]]
* provides a taxonomy of terms, concepts and definitions to compare agent systems;
* identifies functional elements that are common in agent systems;
* captures data flow and dependencies among the functional elements in agent systems; and
* specifies assumptions and requirements regarding the dependencies among these elements.

The ASRM differentiates itself from [[technical standard]]s, such as [[Knowledge Interchange Format]], [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]], and those of the [[FIPA|Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]] in that it defines the required ''existence'' of components of a multiagent system; standards prescribe how they are ''designed''.

==Technical approach==

The ASRM was technically constructed through [[Reverse engineering|forensic software analysis]] of existing agent-based systems.  Such fielded systems include [[Java Agent DEvelopment framework|JaDE]], [[Cougaar]], [[Extendable mobile agent architecture|EMAA]], [[NOMADS]], [[Retsina (agent framework)|Retsina]], [[A-Globe]], among others.  In so doing, through empirical evidence, the ASRM motivates its functional breakdown of agent-based systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15380">'''Alternatives assessment''' or '''alternatives analysis''' is a problem-solving approach used in [[environmental design]], [[environmental technology|technology]], and [[environmental policy|policy]]. It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] action and avoid [[Analysis paralysis|paralysis by analysis]]; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to [[risk assessment]], the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy.&lt;ref name="obrien_2000"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-15051-4| last = O'Brien| first = Mary| title = Making better environmental decisions: An alternative to risk assessment| location = Cambridge| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of ''technology options analysis'' as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation.&lt;ref name="ashford_1994"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Resources for the Future| isbn = 0-915707-74-8| pages = 275–314| editor = Adam M.

Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to [[green chemistry]], [[sustainable design]], supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy.&lt;ref name="geiser_2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-51206-0| last = Geiser| first = Ken| title = Chemicals without harm: Policies for a sustainable world| location = Cambridge, Mass.| series = Urban and industrial environments| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| editor = Roy M. Harrison| editor2 = Ronald E. Hester| title = Chemical alternatives assessments| location = Cambridge| series = Issues in Environmental Science and Technology| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability.&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| last1 = Rossi| first1 = Mark| last2 = Tickner| first2 = Joel| last3 = Geiser| first3 = Ken| title = Alternatives assessment framework of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| location = Lowell, MA| url=http://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/FinalAltsAssess06_000.pdf| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment ''frameworks'' exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of [[Hazard (risk)|hazard]], exposure, [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle]] impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision-making strategy.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1409581| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 124| issue = 3| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Molly M.| last2 = Malloy| first2 = Timothy F.| last3 = Tickner| first3 = Joel A.| last4 = Edwards| first4 = Sally| title = Alternatives assessment frameworks: Research needs for the informed substitution of hazardous chemicals| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2016-03-01| pmid=26339778| pmc=4786344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major framework, the [https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/ Lowell Center for Sustainable Production] Alternatives Assessment Framework,&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk" /&gt; conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016" /&gt;

=== Chemical alternatives assessment ===

Chemical alternatives assessment (or ''substitution of hazardous chemicals'') is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances. Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design.&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es1015789| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 44| issue = 24| pages = 9244–9249| last1 = Lavoie| first1 = Emma T.| last2 = Heine| first2 = Lauren G.| last3 = Holder| first3 = Helen| last4 = Rossi| first4 = Mark S.| last5 = Lee| first5 = Robert E.| last6 = Connor| first6 = Emily A.| last7 = Vrabel| first7 = Melanie A.| last8 = DiFiore| first8 = David M.| last9 = Davies| first9 = Clive L.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: Enabling substitution to safer chemicals| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2010-12-15| pmid=21062050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tickner_2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es503328m| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 49| issue = 2| pages = 742–749| last1 = Tickner| first1 = Joel A.| last2 = Schifano| first2 = Jessica N.| last3 = Blake| first3 = Ann| last4 = Rudisill| first4 = Catherine| last5 = Mulvihill| first5 = Martin J.| title = Advancing safer alternatives through functional substitution| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a [[carcinogen]]ic chemical with a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] one), 
and to minimize the [[unintended consequences]] of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent "[[Hazard substitution#Regrettable substitutions|regrettable substitutions]]", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.&lt;ref name="howard_2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.034| issn = 0045-6535| last = Howard| first = Gregory J.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: The case of flame retardants| journal = Chemosphere| date = 2014| volume=116| pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd_toolbox"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| title = OECD substitution and alternatives assessment toolbox| url = http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include [[chemical hazard]] assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], such as those defined in the
[[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]] or the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]].

=== Examples ===

* The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has conducted alternatives assessments for the substitution of hazardous substances like lead and formaldehyde.&lt;ref name="turi_five"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Toxics Use Reduction Institute| title = Five Chemicals Alternatives Assessment Study| accessdate = 2016-07-31| date = 2006| url = http://www.turi.org/TURI_Publications/TURI_Methods_Policy_Reports/Five_Chemicals_Alternatives_Assessment_Study._2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of alternatives assessment ==

Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment.

=== In the United States ===

Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group.&lt;ref name="nrc_2014"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The National Academies Press| isbn = 978-0-309-31013-0| author = National Research Council (US)| title = A framework to guide selection of chemical alternatives| location = Washington, D.C| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] ran a program called ''Design for the Environment'' (now called [https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice Safer Choice]), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010" /&gt; and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products.&lt;ref name="usepa_dfe"&gt;{{Cite web| author = US Environmental Protection Agency| title = Design for the Environment alternatives assessments| url = https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/design-environment-alternatives-assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The [[Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]] has provided public technical assistance for "toxics use reduction planning", which includes alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="eliason_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.05.011| issn = 0959-6526| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 517–526| last1 = Eliason| first1 = Pamela| last2 = Morose| first2 = Gregory| title = Safer alternatives assessment: The Massachusetts process as a model for state governments| journal = Journal of Cleaner Production| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products.&lt;ref name="ca_dtsc_aa"&gt;{{Cite web| author = California Department of Toxic Substances Control| title = Alternatives analysis| work = Safer Consumer Products (SCP)| url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/AA.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="ic2_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse| title = IC2 Alternatives assessment guide, version 1.0| url=http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the [http://bizngo.org/ Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials] have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="bizngo_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials (BizNGO)| title = BizNGO chemical alternatives assessment protocol| url=http://www.bizngo.org/alternatives-assessment/chemical-alternatives-assessment-protocol| date = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

The Sweden-based non-governmental organization [[ChemSec]] has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.  The [http://www.subsport.eu/ Substitution support portal (SUBSPORT)] is an EU-based collaboratively-developed resource for chemical substitution.&lt;ref name="lissner_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2190/NS.21.3.l| issn = 1541-3772| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 477–497| last1 = Lissner| first1 = Lothar| last2 = Romano| first2 = Dolores| title = Substitution for hazardous chemicals on an international level—The approach of the European project "SUBSPORT"| journal = NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy| date = 2011-01-01| pmid=22001043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes alternatives assessment case studies.

'''Biomarkers''' are chemicals, metabolites, susceptibility characteristics, or changes in the body that relate to the exposure of an organism to a chemical. They have the ability to identify if an exposure has occurred, the route of exposure, the pathway of exposure, and the resulting effects of the exposure. The use of biomarkers in exposure studies is also referred to as [[biomonitoring (chemistry)|biomonitoring]]. When dealing with exposure assessment, there are three types of biomarkers that can be useful, biomarkers of susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure, and biomarkers of effect. Biomarkers of exposure are the most widely used because they can provide information on the route, pathway, and sometimes, even the source of exposure.

==Biomarkers of susceptibility==
Biomarkers of susceptibility are indicators of the natural characteristics of an organism that make it more susceptible to the effects of an exposure to a chemical.  They can help define what sensitivities are more susceptible as well as critical times when exposures can be most detrimental.  For example, the exhalation strength of an asthmatic will indicate how susceptible that person would be to the respiratory effects of exposure to brevetoxin, the toxic compound produced during a red tide.

==Biomarkers of exposure==
Biomarkers of exposure are the actual chemicals, or chemical metabolites, that can be measured in the body or after excretion from the body to determine different characteristics of an organism’s exposure.  For example, a person or fish’s blood can be tested to see the levels of lead and therefore determine the exposure.

==Biomarkers of effect==
Biomarkers of effect are the quantifiable changes that an individual endures, which indicates an exposure to a compound and may indicate a resulting health effect.  For example, after exposure to [[DDT]], an [[organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] known to cause problems in the reproductive system, a woman may experience miscarriages, which can be linked to her previous exposure.

Biomarkers of exposure are the most widely used because they can provide information on the route, pathway, and sometimes, even the source of exposure.  These indicators also allow researchers to work forward in time to determine an exposure, and prevent it from causing further damage.  This is unlike biomarkers of effect, in which a scientist may work backwards to determine if and what kind of exposure took place, but may be too late to change anything.  However, biomarkers of effect are useful for future studies on the chemical(s) of interest and the results may aid in stricter laws or guidelines regarding the chemical(s).

Biomarkers must be evaluated in terms of their ability to predict and quantify exposure and dose.  There are certain properties that are desirable when linking a biomarker with an exposure.  These include high specificity (one exposure to one biomarker), linear relationship across time, strong correlation with a health effect, inexpensive study, and consistency (the same exposure will produce the same concentration of the biomarker every time).  Without these ideal characteristics, the use of biomarkers as a strong predictor of exposure has limitations.

Many different classes of compounds can be measured in different tissues and parts of the body.  From breath to hair to saliva, almost every tissue in the body has been tested as a biomarker of exposure and almost every major environmental pollutant can be identified by biomarkers, including volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and metals like arsenic or lead.  It all depends on the chemical structures and reactivity of the compound with the makeup of its storage space.  The following table identifies major environmental pollutants and their biomarker tissue or organ&lt;ref&gt;Ott, W. R., Steinemann, A. C., &amp; Wallace, L. A. (2007). Biomarkers of exposure. In W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4425">'''Bioresource engineering''' is similar to [[biological engineering]], except that it is based on biological and/or agricultural feedstocks. Bioresource engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as [[biomass]], biological waste treatment, bioenergy, [[biotransformations]], bioresource systems analysis, [[bioremediation]] and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies such as combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc.

Bioresource engineering also contains biochemical conversion technologies such as aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, and composting.  Products include fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products, and management products e.g. modelling, systems analysis, decisions, and support systems. 
Bioresource engineering is a discipline that is usually very similar to environmental engineering.

The impact of [[urbanization]] and increasing demand for food, water and land presents bioresource engineers with the task of bridging the gap between the biological world and traditional engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smithers |first=JC |title=WHAT IS BIORESOURCES ENGINEERING?"

'''Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate''' (or '''tiomolibdate'''  [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], trade name '''Decuprate'''), is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[tetrathiomolybdate (disambiguation)|tetrathiomolybdate]] (TTM, MoS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[choline]] currently under investigation as a therapy against [[Wilson's disease]], a rare and potentially fatal disease in which the body cannot regulate [[copper]]. Wilson's disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[Heredity|genetic]] disorder that is manifested by serious [[hepatic]], [[neurologic]] or [[psychiatric symptoms]]. The disease is fatal if left undiagnosed and untreated. It is estimated that approximately 1 individual in every 30,000 worldwide have Wilson's disease, corresponding to approximately 15,000{{Verify source|date=July 2016}} individuals in the European Union and approximately 11,000{{Verify source|date=July 2016}} in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17276780|year=2007|author1=Ala|first1=A|title=Wilson's disease|journal=The Lancet|volume=369|issue=9559|pages=397–408|last2=Walker|first2=A.

Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate is a de-coppering therapy in [[clinical development]] against Wilson's disease under the code name WTX101 by [[Wilson Therapeutics]] AB. Wilson Therapeutics was founded by [[HealthCap]] in 2012.

== Mechanism of action ==

Tetrathiomolybdate has a unique [[mechanism of action]] through which it selectively forms highly stable complexes with copper and proteins. These complexes are then believed to be primarily excreted via the [[bile]], restoring the normal excretion route of copper that is impaired in patients with Wilson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10728780|year=2000|author1=Komatsu|first1=Y|title=Excretion of copper complexed with thiomolybdate into the bile and blood in LEC rats|journal=Chemico-biological interactions|volume=124|issue=3|pages=217–31|last2=Sadakata|first2=I|last3=Ogra|first3=Y|last4=Suzuki|first4=K.

T.|doi=10.1016/S0946-672X(11)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding and [[excretion]] mechanism of WTX101 is stable; whereas many de-coppering agents form unstable complexes that are excreted via urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23563391|year=2013|author1=Říha|first1=M|title=Novel method for rapid copper chelation assessment confirmed low affinity of D-penicillamine for copper in comparison with trientine and 8-hydroxyquinolines|journal=Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry|volume=123|pages=80–7|last2=Karlíčková|first2=J|last3=Filipský|first3=T|last4=MacÁková|first4=K|last5=Hrdina|first5=R|last6=Mladěnka|first6=P|doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data suggest that bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate can rapidly lower and control toxic free copper levels and improve clinical symptoms in Wilson's disease patients. The data also suggest that it is generally well-tolerated with the potential for a reduced risk of neurological worsening after initiation of therapy compared to existing therapies.&lt;ref name="Brewer09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer03" /&gt;

As of November 2014, a Phase 2, multi-centre, open-label study is recruiting newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients 18 and older to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate administration over a 24-week period.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02273596|Efficacy and Safety Study of WTX101 in Adult Wilson Disease Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsonsdisease.org/wilson-disease-research/wilsondisease-clinicaltrials.php |title=Wilson Disease Clinical Trials.

== Dosing ==

Previous clinical studies with bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate in oncology patients have shown that it can lower and maintain copper levels using a once or twice daily oral dosing.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowndes" /&gt; This is an important finding, since untreated Wilson's disease may lead to death within several years of the onset of symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15742108|year=2005|author1=Członkowska|first1=A|title=Wilson's disease-cause of mortality in 164 patients during 1992-2003 observation period|journal=Journal of Neurology|volume=252|issue=6|pages=698–703|last2=Tarnacka|first2=B|last3=Litwin|first3=T|last4=Gajda|first4=J|last5=Rodo|first5=M|doi=10.1007/s00415-005-0720-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medication use should continue throughout the patient's lifespan. Patient [[compliance (medicine)|compliance]] is crucial for clinical improvement, and it is a particular challenge for Wilson's disease patients taking de-coppering treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20625962|year=2010|author1=Masełbas|first1=W|title=Persistence with treatment in patients with Wilson disease|journal=Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska|volume=44|issue=3|pages=260–3|last2=Chabik|first2=G|last3=Członkowska|first3=A|doi=10.1016/s0028-3843(14)60040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Technical Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living''' (CETpD) is an applied research and technology transfer centre created for the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia|Universitat Politèncica de Catalunya]] and the ''Fundació Hospital Comarcal Sant Antoni Abat'' on behalf of the ''Consorci de Servei a les Persones'' de Vilanova i la Geltrú, with the aim of covering the demand for research and development in the field of [[Gerontechnology]], [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]], Assistive [[Robotics]] and [[usability|User Experience Technologies]].

The CETpD carried out important applied research work and innovation on socially relevant developments, especially on technologies and systems designed to enhance independent living of elderly and disabled people.

== Areas ==

=== Ambient Intelligence ===
[[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] (AmI) implies an environment of distributed computing systems, unobstrusive and often invisible, with user friendly interfaces capable of learning and adapting to the particular needs of the users.
CETpD AmI projects are included in the [[assistive technology|assistance]] field mainly for housing and health application. We are looking for technological solutions that have the potential to include everyone, that are affordable and build trust and confidence directed to improve the quality of life of any person specially elders and disabled.

=== Assistive Robotics ===
The priority lines of work are three:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop new architectures of control and forms of signal processing which the robots allow to capture knowledge and being cognitive through the [[human-machine interaction]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To research in the more suitable forms of [[interaction]], so they are motivating and satisfying for the [[user (computing)|user]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop in an effective way [[robotic]] systems that are capable of supplying with personalised individual [[assistive technology|assistance]] to people with dependence (permanent, rehabilitation or convalescence). Therefore, the research implies areas like HRI, control and systems of [[machine learning|computational learning]] in complex, changing and uncertain environments, integrating processes of [[perception]], representation and [[interaction]] with people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Usability ===
The purpose of the user experience field, [[usability]], is to provide relevant information about users expectations, capabilities and preferences, in order to ensure that products and services would meet end users -and other stakeholders- functional and affective needs. All the CETpD projects incorporates user's experience feedback in the process of contextual product and services development.

=== Balance, Gaits and Falls ===
Gait alterations, balance alterations and falls are major causes of [[disability]] in the elderly population. Such pathologies seriously impair elders' quality of life; furthermore, their consequences have high economic and social impact. Therefore, clinical and epedimiological studies on these pathologies are conducted at the CETpD in order to gain insight into their causes and to find novel therapeutics.

=== Gerontechnology ===
A major objective in geriatrics is to maintain elderly persons' independence to carry out their daily life activities and to interact with their environment. In this regard, [[technology]] may be an essential tool to facilitate elderly persons' [[autonomy]]. At the CETpD, they develop [[technology]] aimed to their environment, as well as remote diagnosis devices designed for early detection of health alterations in frail persons or persons living alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">'''Casa Viva''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Wheaton, Illinois]] and [[San Jose, Costa Rica]]. Casa Viva seeks to place children who have been separated from their families into a safe, caring family. Casa Viva is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for “Living Families” or “Living Homes.” The model of international child care that Casa Viva has created:
*Doesn’t rely on ongoing American funding
*Is nationally based
*Uses the social network of [[Christian]] churches to identify and train families
Casa Viva primarily cares for [[social orphan]]s, and also cares for true [[orphans]].

==Casa Viva’s History==
In 1998 Philip and Jill Aspegren moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] to build an orphanage and train nationals to care for the children there with [[Kids Alive]]. But there had to be a better way: a less expensive, less institutional, quicker way to care for children internationally. They began to dream of a childcare model that does not require new buildings and that places children in families rather than in homes.

Moving to [[Costa Rica]] in 2005 they began to network with local churches, recruiting families belonging to those churches to care for children. Children who have been separated from their biological families are placed in families on a short term basis while their family is identified and counseled. Children are also placed in Casa Viva homes long term when it is impossible for the child to be reunited with their biological family. Children placed in a Casa Viva home have the advantage of growing up in a home that is surrounded by [[extended family]], [[local church]], and the support of the Casa Viva center.

==Casa Viva Today==
There are currently two Casa Viva Communities in [[Costa Rica]] - one in Eastern San Jose and a second in Grecia. In partnership with the Viva Network and Toybox it has identified [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]] as the next sites of multiplication.

===Developing Family Based Child Care International===
====Alternative to Orphanages====
Orphanages, whether private or government run, are institutions that are expensive to run and the good ones often become inundated with children sent there by the authorities. This reduces the quality of care and leaves the institution and its staff overworked and under equipped. While the physical needs of the child are met, often psychological needs of a child, the privacy of a child, and integration into their home culture are found to be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf Save The Children: A Last Resort] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907101844/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Casa Viva to begin creating a program, similar to England and the United States' [[foster care]] model, but with two primary differences:
*Church based
*Little financial incentive
In some cases, the financial benefit of already-established government-based fostering has become a primary motivator for families to be host foster families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster07.htm Lifting the Veil on Foster Care]&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Viva does help families cover the cost of caring for the child but relies heavily on Biblical motivation and mandates to care for the orphan in need.

====Children Raised in Families====
It has been shown that children raised in orphanages do not develop as well physically, cognitively or emotionally as children raised in family based settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_4_38/ai_n15338080 The House, The Street, Global Society: Latin American families and childhood in the twenty-first century]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the chain of trust.]]
In computer security, a '''chain of trust''' is established by validating each component of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] from the end entity up to the root certificate.  It is intended to ensure that only trusted software and hardware can be used while still retaining flexibility.

==Introduction==
A chain of trust is designed to allow multiple users to create and use software on the system, which would be more difficult if all the keys were stored directly in hardware. It starts with hardware that will only boot from software that is [[Digital signature|digitally signed]].  The signing authority will only sign boot programs that enforce security, such as only running programs that are themselves signed, or only allowing signed code to have access to certain features of the machine. This process may continue for several layers.

This process results in a chain of trust. The final software can be trusted to have certain properties, because if it had been illegally modified its signature would be invalid, and the previous software would not have executed it. The previous software can be trusted, because it, in turn, would not have been loaded if its signature had been invalid. The trustworthiness of each layer is guaranteed by the one before, back to the [[trust anchor]].

It would be possible to have the hardware check the suitability (signature) for every single piece of software. However, this would not produce the flexibility that a "chain" provides. In a chain, any given link can be replaced with a different version to provide different properties, without having to go all the way back to the trust anchor. This use of multiple layers is an application of a general technique to improve scalability, and is analogous to the use of multiple certificates in a [[Root certificate|certificate chain]].

==Computer security==
In computer security, digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root [[certificate authority]] (CA).

The certificate hierarchy is a structure of certificates that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy, so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate that signed it.

The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and [[intermediate certificate authority|intermediate certificates]] (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy. This process is best described in the page ''[[Intermediate certificate authority]]''. See also [[X.509#Certificate chains and cross-certification|X.509 certificate chains]] for a description of these concepts in a widely used standard for digital certificates.

The '''chronology of the Bible''' is an elaborate system of lifespans, "generations," and other means by which the passage of events is measured, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and extending through other significant events. A widespread scholarly understanding is that the Bible marks out a world cycle ([[Great Year]]) of 4,000 years, beginning with Creation and ending, presumably, around 164 [[Common Era|BCE]], with the year [[Anno Mundi|AM]] 2666 for [[the Exodus]] representing 26 2/3 of 100 years or two-thirds of the total.&lt;ref name="Johnson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall D.

By adding the remaining 375 years we arrive—in our modern calculations—at 538 - 375 = 163 BCE, the date of the rededication of the temple by Judas Maccabee. Of course, this calculation implies that the framers of the chronology were aware of the accurate figure. So possibly the endpoint is the year of desecration (167), or even a date a little in the future, the date of the expected eschaton ... If so, the present Masoretic chronology dates from the second century BCE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blenkinsopp2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Blenkinsopp|title=Opening the Sealed Book: Interpretations of the Book of Isaiah in Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ePy3U7GkvQC&amp;pg=PA87|date=7 November 2006|publisher=Wm.

If, as has been suggested, a figure of 4000 was held in mind, the present biblical chronology might be predicated upon the rededication of the Temple (about 164 BCE) after its profanation by Antiochus, which would establish a connection with Daniel, as well as with the books of Enoch and Jubilees. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=234}} It was theological in intent, not historical in the modern sense,{{sfn|Christensen|1990|p=148}} and functions as an implied prophecy whose key lies in the identification of the final event.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|pp=73–74}}

The count begins with creation and Year 1. The passage of time from the Creation to [[the Exodus]] is measured by adding the ages of the [[Patriarch]]s at the birth of their firstborn sons, later through express statements, and later still by the synchronised reigns of the [[kings of Israel and Judah]].{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The Exodus takes place in the year [[Anno Mundi|''anno mundi'']] 2666, or AM 2666, exactly two thirds of the way through the four thousand years, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is commenced 480 years, or 12 generations of 40 years each, after that, and 430 years pass between the building of the Temple and its destruction.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=96–97}} The 50 years between the destruction of the Temple and the "[[Cyrus's edict|Decree of Cyrus]]" and end of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]], added to the 430 years for which the Temple stood, produces another symmetrical period of 480 years,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} and the 374 years between the re-dedication of the Temple by the [[Maccabees]] and the Edict of Cyrus completes the 4,000 years.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}

As recently as the 18th century, scholars of the stature of [[Isaac Newton]] believed that the date of Creation was knowable from the Bible.{{sfn|Barr|1987|p=3}} Today, the Genesis account of Creation has long since vanished from serious [[cosmology]], the Patriarchs and Exodus are no longer included in most serious histories of ancient Israel,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}} and it is almost universally accepted that [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]] have little historical value.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Mazar|2007|pp=62, 74}} Even the monarchy is questioned, and although scholars continue to advance proposals for reconciling the chronology of the [[Books of Kings]], there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=81, 168}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

== Pre-Masoretic chronologies ==
During the centuries that [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Biblical texts and canons developed]], theological chronologies emerged at different composition stages, though scholars have advanced various theories to identify these stages and their schematizations of time. These chronologies include:
* A "Progenitor" chronology that placed [[Abraham]]'s birth at AM 1600 and the foundation of the Temple at AM 2800. Alfred Jepsen proposed this chronology on the basis of melding time periods in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan]] and [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic recensions]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=3ff.}}
* Distinct chronologies can be inferred from the [[Priestly source]] (of the Pentateuch), along with priestly authors of later Biblical books,&lt;ref&gt;On the "Priestly chronology", see especially Hughes, e.g., 233f.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deuteronomistic history]], which purports to chronicle the reigns of the kings of Judah and Israel (with some significant historical corroboration, see below and [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]). 
* The Nehemiah chronology, devised to show 3,500 years from creation to [[Nehemiah|Nehemiah's]] mission. Northcote says that this chronology was "probably composed by [[Levites]] in Jerusalem not long after Nehemiah's mission, perhaps sometime late in the fifth century BCE (i.e. nearing 400 BCE)."{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}} Bousset (1900) apparently sees this schematization, too, but calls it Proto-[[Masoretic Text|MT]].{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=8}}
* A proto-Masoretic chronology, shaped by [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilees]], with an overall literary showing of 3,480 years from creation to the completion of the [[Second Temple]], per B.W. Bousset (1900), and which had the [[first Temple]] at 3,000 years.
* The Saros chronology that reflected 3,600 years leading up to the first Temple and 4,080 years from creation to the completion of the Second Temple. This scheme served as "the basis for the later [[Septuagint|LXX]] chronology and pre-SP [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] chronologies".{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=12}}

== Masoretic Text ==

{{hatnote|The following table is derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past'';{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}} notes within the table as cited.}}

It should be noted that some data in this table are questionable. For example, Genesis 11:10 states that Shem was 100 years old when he gave birth to his son two years after the flood. The statement (Gn 5:32) that Noah was 500 years old when his sons were born, means that they were born starting then. Some commentators state that Shem was the youngest of the three, which could mean that he was born two years later in order to make his age 100 two years after the flood. If one starts from two years after the flood (no matter what the age of Shem was) and adds the ages of his descendants, Abraham was born in 1948 AM. Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old in 2048. According to some commentators the Exodus is dated as 400 years after the birth of Isaac (from Genesis 15:13), making it 2448. According to others the 430 year time mentioned in Exodus 12:40 is dated from the descent of Jacob to Aegypt, making it 2668.

The temple was built 480 years after the Exodus, in the fourth year of King Solomon's rein, according to I Kings 6:1. This places the start of King Solomon's reign as 2924 and the building of the temple as 2928.

The Masoretic Text is the basis of modern Jewish and Christian bibles. While difficulties with Biblical texts make it impossible to reach sure conclusions, perhaps the most widely held hypothesis is that it embodies an overall scheme of 4,000 years (a "great year") taking the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE as its end-point.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}} Two motives may have led to this: first, there was a common idea at the time of the Maccabees that human history followed the plan of a divine "week" of seven "days" each lasting a thousand years;{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=246}} and second, a 4,000 year history—even longer in the Septuagint version—would establish the antiquity of the Jews against their pagan neighbours.{{sfn|Barr|2001|pp=98–99}}

== Other Second Temple chronologies: Septuagint, Samaritan, Jubilees==
[[File:Tissot Solomon Dedicates the Temple at Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Solomon Dedicates the Temple ([[James Tissot]])]]

The canonical text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is called the [[Masoretic Text]], a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early the 7th and 10th centuries CE. There are, however, two other major texts, the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. The Septuagint is a [[Koine Greek]] translation of the original [[biblical Hebrew]] holy books. It is estimated that the first five books of the Septuagint, known as the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, were translated in the mid-3rd century [[BCE]] and the remaining texts were translated in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=April 7, 2018|date=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly agrees with the Masoretic Text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the [[Samaritan]] community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries BCE—just when is disputed—and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic Text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic Text as superior to the other two—the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a13.htm 1 Samuel 13:1]&lt;/ref&gt; More relevantly, all three texts have a clear purpose, which is not to record history so much as to bring the narrative to a point which represents the culmination of history.

In the Samaritan Pentateuch, 'the genealogies and narratives were shaped to ensure a chronology of 3000 years from creation to the Israelite settlement of Canaan. Northcote reports this as the "Proto-SP chronology," as designated by John Skinner (1910), and he speculates that this chronology may have been extended to put the rebuilding of the Second Temple at an even AM 3900, after three 1,300-year phases. In the Septuagint version of the Pentateuch the Israelite chronology extends 4,777 years from creation to the finishing of the Second Temple, as witnessed in the [[Codex Alexandrinus]] manuscript. This calculation only emerges by supplementing Septuagint with the MT's chronology of kings. There were at least 3 variations of Septuagint chronology; [[Eusebius]] used one variation, now favored by Hughes and others. Northcote asserts that the Septuagint calendrical pattern was meant to demonstrate that there were 5,000 years from creation to a contemporaneous [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], circa 300 BCE.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|pp=14ff}}

The 2nd century BCE [[Book of Jubilees]] begins with the Creation and measures time in years, "weeks" of years (groups of seven years), and jubilees (sevens of sevens), so that the interval from Creation to the settlement of Canaan, for example, is exactly fifty jubilees (2450 years).{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p=245}}

==Seder Olam==

More significant, and still in common use among Jews, was the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ("Great Order of the World"), a work tracing the history of the world and the Jews from Creation to the 2nd century CE.{{sfn|Milikowski|2011|p = 656}}{{sfn|Solomon|2006|p = 61}} It allows 410 years for the duration of the First Temple, 70 years from its destruction to the Second Temple, and 420 years for the duration of the Second Temple, making a total of 900 years for the two temples.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 253}} This schematic approach to numbers accounts for its most remarkable feature, the fact that it shortens the entire Persian Empire from over two centuries to just 52 years, mirroring the 52 years it gives to the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Hughes|1990|p = 257}}

==Christian use and development of biblical chronology==

The early Church Father [[Eusebius]] (c. 260–340), attempting to place Christ in the chronology, put his birth in AM 5199, and this became the accepted date for the Western Church.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}} As the year AM 6000 (800 CE) approached there was increasing fear that the end of the world was nigh, until the [[Venerable Bede]] made his own calculations and found that Christ's birth took place in AM 3592, allowing several more centuries to the end of time.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=259–260}}

[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) switched the point of focus from Christ's birth to the Apostolic Council of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 15, which he placed in the year AM 4000, believing this marked the moment when the Mosaic Law was abolished and the new age of grace began.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=260–261}} This was widely accepted among European Protestants, but in the English-speaking world, Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1581–1656) calculated a date of 4004 BCE for creation; he was not the first to reach this result, but his chronology was so detailed that his dates were incorporated into the margins of English Bibles for the next two hundred years.{{sfn|Hughes|1990|pp=261–262}} This popular 4,000 year theological timespan, which ends with the birth of Jesus, differs from the 4,000 timespan later proposed for the Masoretic text alone, which ends with the Temple rededication in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}

==The Israelite kings==
{{For|detailed reconstructions of the chronology of the Hebrew kings|Kings of Judah}}

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|pp=95–96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]], linking the Hebrew kings by accession and length of reign ("king X of Judah came to the throne in the ''n''th year of king Y of Israel and ruled ''n'' years"), can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}}

Possibly the most widely followed attempt to reconcile the contradictions has been that proposed by [[Edwin R. Thiele]] in his ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} The weaknesses in Thiele's work have led subsequent scholars to continue to propose chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}

'''Comic timing''' is the use of rhythm, tempo, and pausing to enhance [[comedy]] and [[humour]]. The pacing of the delivery of a [[joke]] can have a strong impact on its comedic effect, even altering its meaning; the same can also be true of more physical comedy such as [[slapstick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Capture Your Flag|title=Matt Ruby on How to Improve Comic Timing|date=2011-10-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ljIlqGNp0|accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''beat''' is a pause taken for the purposes of comic timing, often to allow the audience time to recognize the joke and react, or to heighten the suspense before delivery of the expected [[punch line]]. Pauses, sometimes called "dramatic pauses" in this context, can be used to discern subtext or even unconscious content&amp;mdash;that is, what the speaker is really thinking about. A pause can also be used to heighten a switch in direction. As a speaker talks, the audience naturally "fills in the blanks", finishing the expected end of the thought. The pause allows this to happen before the comedian delivers a different outcome, surprising the listener and (hopefully) evoking laughter.

[[Jack Benny]] and [[Victor Borge]] are two comedians known for using the extended beat, allowing the pause itself to become a source of humour beyond the original joke. [[George Carlin]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] are two other stand-up comedians considered{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} to have superior timing.

== Some examples ==
{{Synthesis|section|date=March 2014}}

=== George Carlin ===

[[George Carlin|Carlin]]'s most famous routine was his "[[Seven Words You Can't Say On Television]]", in which much of the humour is derived from a sudden, rapid-fire delivery of the seven words. The remainder of the routine was a mock-scholarly analysis of why these words are not as bad as the world would have us believe. Here, comic timing is used again as Carlin moved from the rapid list to a more reasoned dissection of the words.

=== Rowan Atkinson ===

[[Rowan Atkinson|Atkinson]] is another example of timing in this regard. His "No One Called Jones" routine involves his reading a class roll of students at what we can assume is an exclusive English boarding school. In one version of this routine, each name is a [[double entendre]]. In this sort of routine, it is very important to use beats, as simply racing through the list would spoil the effect of many of the jokes.

=== Victor Borge ===

Commonly recognized as a master of comic timing,{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=|https://books.google.com.au/books?id=YA3cCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63&amp;lpg=PT63&amp;dq=victor+borge+master+of+comic+timing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hq_yT8bvJI&amp;sig=s3cySJT7UMole11tvtYJmLsN0O8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwizt_Omv4zdAhWKMN4KHcprBEYQ6AEwDHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=victor%20borge%20master%20of%20comic%20timing&amp;f=false=}} Danish-American comedian [[Victor Borge]] provides even more examples of this art. Much of his routine involved references to particular pieces of [[european classical music|classical music]], [[opera]] and [[composer]]s. Having learned English as a second language, Borge was known for frequently playing around with its conventions. A prime example is his question to his audience, "Is there anyone who would like to hear the famous ''Polonaise'' in A Flat by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]?" After hearing the inevitable calls of "Yes, yes", Borge would respond, "Very well, is there anyone here who can play it?" Another famous line is his explanation for the third pedal on a grand piano&amp;mdash;"The pedal in the middle is there to separate the other two pedals...(''beat'')...which could be a problem for those of you who have three feet."

Borge, therefore, builds his audience up to the joke, but only delivers the actual punchline when he is fully aware that they are silent and prepared to hear it. His famous "[[Inflationary Language]]" routine demonstrates the other side of this statement. In this routine, Borge adds one to every "number in the language", (making "wonderful" into "two-derful" and so on) and his "Phonetic Punctuation" routine, wherein he assigns a sound to every punctuation mark. These routines then consist of Borge reading a story under one of these systems. The comic timing is seen by the way that he reads alternately slowly and rapidly, in keeping with the action of the story.

=== Sacha Baron Cohen ===
In [[Sacha Baron Cohen|Cohen]]'s mockumentary ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', the character Borat is coached on the importance of comic timing. He is to state "That suit is black (pause) NOT!" However, he does it with both no pause, with too long a pause, and [[Use-mention distinction|even the word "pause."]]

==Farce==
The [[farce]] is another example of comic timing. Here, the humour is derived both from rapid speech and rapid movement&amp;mdash;people running into and out of rooms at breakneck speed and managing to cause havoc in the process as commonly used in the series ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.

==Pregnant pause==
A pregnant pause (as in the [[wiktionary:pregnant|classical definition]], "many possibilities") is a technique of comic timing used to accentuate a comedy element, which uses comic pauses at the end of a phrase to build up [[suspense]]. It's often used at the end of a comically awkward statement or in the silence after a seemingly non-comic phrase to build up a comeback. Refined by [[Jack Benny]] who introduced specific body language and a phrase in his pregnant pauses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Well! Jack's Back : HBO tribute remembers the late comedian |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-04/news/tv-632_1_jack-benny-show |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pregnant pause has become a staple of [[stand-up comedy]].

'''Dalibor Vesely''' (19 June 1934 – 31 March 2015&lt;ref name="AJObituary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/obituary-dalibor-vesely-1934-2015/8680795.article|title=Obituary: Dalibor Vesely (1934 – 2015)|work=[[Architects'_Journal]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-born [[architectural historian]] and [[Architectural theory|theorist]] who was influential through his teaching and writing in promoting the role of [[hermeneutics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as part of the discourse of architecture and of architectural design.

Vesely was one of the most outstanding architectural teachers of the late twentieth century. As well as inspiring generations of students, he taught some of the current leading architects and architectural historians, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Eric Parry]], [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. He began teaching at the [[University of Essex]], before moving to  the [[Architectural Association]] in London and in 1978 to the [[University of Cambridge Department of Architecture]], where he also started an M.Phil. programme in History and Philosophy of Architecture with [[Peter Carl]]. Together with Peter Carl, his teaching and theoretical approach became associated and dominated the Cambridge Architecture School in the 1980s and early 1990s. After retiring from his full-time post in Cambridge, Vesely continued to teach there, remaining Director of Studies at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and he also taught Architectural History and Philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and was an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the [[Manchester School of Architecture]]. In 2005 he was recipient of the CICA Bruno Zevi Book Award granted by the [[International Committee of Architectural Critics]] for his book "Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation". In 2006 the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) honoured Dalibor Vesely with the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Architectural Education and in 2015 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA in recognition of both his lifetime contributions to architectural theory and to teaching.  

== Biography ==
Vesely was Born in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]],in 1934. He studied engineering, architecture, art history and philosophy in [[Prague]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]] and [[Heidelberg]] and obtained his PhD from [[Charles University in Prague]]. This was supervised by  [[Josef Havlicek]], [[Karel Honzik]], and [[Jaroslav Fragner]]. He studied with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], with whom he kept a correspondence until Gadamer's death. He stated it was the philosopher of phenomenology [[Jan Patočka]] who, in his own words, “contributed more than anyone else to [his] overall intellectual orientation and to the articulation of some of the critical topics”  it was under the influence of Gadamer and  Patočka that he developed the lifelong interest in the poetics and hermeneutics of architecture that defined his teaching and research .
Vesely was in England with his brother in 1968 when the Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. He stayed in London, first teaching at the Architectural Association, taking charge of the 'Unit 1' studio and then moving to the [[University of Essex]] where he and [[Joseph Rykwert]] established a Masters Degree in architectural history. He was invited to Cambridge by [[Colin St John Wilson]] in 1978. There he, Rykwert and Peter Carl initiated MPhil and PhD courses in the history and philosophy of architecture, thereby bringing the emerging studio culture which had been cultivated at the AA which came to define the school in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Architecture and hermeneutics ==
Vesely's work may be understood primarily as a contribution to cultural [[hermeneutics]], and his exploration of the historical background of modern science in the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries is particularly rich in detail and insight onto the changing nature of [[representations (arts)|representation]]. Vesely polemises on concepts such as [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[anamorphosis]], which are traditionally understood to have taken departure from [[Renaissance]] culture. Vesely contributes to the current debate with the depth of the problem of representation; a question which has divided [[Western philosophy]] with regard to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] possibility of representation and understanding of natural phenomena. The 'birth' of modern science and its increasing challenge on traditional views has also marked the divide within the possibilities of representation. In the context of the seventeenth century, this was especially clear as a polemics surrounding the nature of scientific work and philosophical understanding.

According to Vesely, the inevitable partiality of such views is at the very core of the problem that affects the cultural understanding of representation. Its contingent nature was not always understood as a divide originating all kinds of dualisms. Before modern science, representation was naturally contingent and the universal aspirations of science ([[metaphysics]]) were bound to the nature of the epistemological ground (''arché''). Vesely's work traces back the [[ontological]] foundations of the problem to the Greek context, helping to clarify its original meaning. In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely presents the notion of ''ground'' as having a provisional nature, that can only be seized as a continuity of reference through different levels of representation, ranging from the more explicit, visible world down to a ''latent world'' of potential articulation. Precisely this continuity is what may allow us to address the modern, fragmented notion of representation as a task of rehabilitation, which would trace the fragment back to its original whole.

== Architecture and representation ==
Vesely's written work was mostly in articles in journals and many of the arguments developed over the years in lectures and seminars. There is thus no comprehensive overview of his thought or his range of interests. However ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), provides a summary of his thinking and this work remains the main source for understanding his approach. Many of his other ideas which were expressed in lectures and seminars remain unpublished. 

===Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation===
In ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation'' (2004), Vesely sets the argument from the experience of architecture, as it constantly works through different modes of representation, including "built reality". In it, Vesely defines the present cultural situation as divided and ambiguous, especially when it comes to architecture (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–12, 36, 44 ss). Twentieth-century architecture, he argues, places its trust in the epistemological model of modern science and technology that is today largely reflected in instrumental concepts of city and suburban landscape. Today, he states, the attempt to rehabilitate the primary tradition of architecture faces the problem of bridging the gap between different modes of representation and concepts of [[knowledge]] that in some cases precede modern science, i.e., precede the historical notion of scientific knowledge as it takes course from the seventeenth- and sixteenth centuries.

Vesely's research delved into these historical settings that are understood to be the birthplace of modern science, in the general hope of exposing the origin of our modern notion of [[knowledge]] and how it came about to emancipate from traditional representations of the world. Vesely's research was accordingly a working out the historical notion of representation, as it constituted a central issue in this historical affair; and how the construction of a modern notion of knowledge had much to do with a changing nature in the concept of representation (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–19). The concept as it is generally understood today largely surpasses the history of epistemology. According to Vesely, this is because representation is generally understood on the basis of a certain "continuity between a particular mode of representation and what is represented" (p.&amp;nbsp;14), a notion which has been current throughout the whole of European architectural history.

=== The modern situation===
When looking at the modern situation, Vesely finds that the problem is generally structured on the basis of an ontological difference that is intrinsic to representation itself. This is precisely the difference that allows modes of representation to emancipate from that which is represented, and from particular, given circumstances (pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5). The discussion of ''ontological difference'' therefore constitutes an ''epistemological difference'' affecting the conditions and possibilities of knowledge. And speculative thought, which we so associate with modern science, is built on this difference. Charles Taylor (1995) points out how the question for modern science is to fit a particular mode of representation to another, extrinsic representation: what we commonly call the "outer reality". The difference between the two constantly jeopardizes their epistemological value; and affects not only the way in which representation relates to ''what it means to represent'', but also between different modes of representing it.

In response, Vesely's work explores how architecture constantly works between different modes of representation, through the difference between project and what is built, for instance, when it translates a whole city into a diagram, a plan or a map. The simple act of reading a map involves more than just the imagination to relate the map with the buildings and the surrounding space; it involves the reciprocity between different levels of representation, that may intake discrepancy and lack of information. According to Vesely, this kind of discrepancy might be useful to understand the nature of the question; and may in fact become a means to understand what impairs the communication between different levels of representation, and conversely, what happens when such communication takes place.

Vesely also takes up the example of an experiment that, paradoxically perhaps, was carried out in the hey-day of logical [[empiricism]]. The experiment was carried out by Schilder, and involved a temporary inversion of the visual field (pp.&amp;nbsp;46ss), leaving other perceptual fields untouched. Schilder's experiment addressed the discontinuity between the visual and other fields of [[perception]], and exposed the situated [[human body]] as a basic structure of spatial reference (pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49). Vesely investigates how the subjects of the experiment found that their bodies were the first instance they could rely on when trying to situate in a visual world that was not only upside down, but also turned from left to right; and when trying to perform simple gestures like picking up a book, or reading. Although the experience was difficult to endure, the inverted vision could be partially reconciled with the original body structure (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

According to Vesely, the ability to reconcile the acquired inverted vision with the situational structure of the human body, points out to a deeper problem when dealing with situation, which is related to our ability to become situated on provisional grounds, even when lacking a fundamental 'ground' of spatial or temporal reference. The example from inverted vision also means to show that such a basis is far from being immediate; it is constituted in the process of a search within the actual space and comes about in the reciprocity between different levels and forms of representation such as visual, tactile, and so forth. Vesely elaborates on situation and the phenomenon of being situated as an example of how we contextualize spatial knowledge and on which basis; and on how a particular point of reference allows us to situate spatial [[knowledge]]. In the course of the argument, Vesely demonstrates that what constitutes the fabric of situation is a continuity of reference and experience through different forms of articulating spatiality down to an implicit structure that itself is neither visual nor tactile, and is only potentially articulated in the objective realm (pp.&amp;nbsp;48, 82–87, 378ss).

=== Situation and perception ===
Vesely's argument on the epistemological process of being situated develops in terms of an analogy to the formation of the visual field. And takes the organic ability of sight only as a point of departure to the phenomenon of [[Visual perception|vision]], i.e. what one is able to recognize and know out of visual [[perception]]. Accordingly, the natural process of seeing is shown to be a result from learning. Vesely presents the example of inborn conditions of blindness treated through surgery, where sight itself only emerges after a painful stage of learning, and without which, the recently acquired sense of sight would be unable to detach or recognize individual objects out of a 'visual field' (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51). Vesely describes how the integration of the newly acquired sense relies on the fact that the world of the blind is already structured, not only in terms of temporal sequences, but spatially; and that the reconciliation of the new ability of sight takes place on an already structured ground of existing objects and spatiality. [[Perception]] such as visual or tactile is reconciled upon an implicitly structured ground.

Vesely shows how the task of bridging different plateaux of representation can only be fulfilled by covering the distance to a common 'ground' (pp.&amp;nbsp;61–63). 'Ground' is like a point of departure from which it would become possible to uncover the basic structure of spatiality; but it is hardly the case that such an epistemological ground can provide us with an absolute source of spatial reference. The notion of epistemological ground is not established a priori, as a given point of reference. It comes about in the process of searching, taking place as a continuum of references between different levels of spatial understanding. In which case, what constitutes the structural source of situation is this ''stream of references'' (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

Vesely's notion of ground consists of a primary source of reference that in many ways coincides with the traditional Greek understanding of ''arché''. ''Arché'' is not an absolute source of reference, but only a primary one that works as a point of departure towards our notion of "earth" and our understanding of "world" (pp.&amp;nbsp;50–52). This is an ''insecure ground'' that in a sense, speaks more of its own [[topography]], than of clearly defined rules and references. Although this is an unfamiliar ground for modern science, Vesely accurately describes how much of the understanding of what it means to be situated derives from the knowledge of daily situations on Earth, where horizon and gravity play a common role. Accordingly, architecture's task of raising and 'building' situations does not address the mere existence of conditions such as floor or gravity, but concerns the fundamental condition of 'ground' allowing the phenomenon of situation to take place.

=== Situation and knowledge ===
On the epistemological level, this means that for Vesely, the nature of 'ground' allows an understanding of ‘spatial structure’; like a ''hermeneutical key'' granting access to phenomena of spatiality. Contemporary architecture has been particularly keen on challenging the average views on ''ground'' viz. gravity. Although most architecture cannot escape the 'predicament' of gravity, there are numerous examples of play with gravity and the 'visual weight' of architectural mass against gravity, starting from the early twentieth-century [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. Such architectural play shows an impulse towards the emancipation from gravity as a natural source of situation, and looks forward to expose a more fundamental ground of reference and its problematic nature. Architecture is thus setting a clear challenge on everyday experience as they are structured characteristically in terms of up and down, and according to a horizontal ground. The experiment of the 'inverted vision' seems to show exactly that: the touch of ground helps to define the vertical and the relative distances of objects, orientation, and to recognize the [[physiognomy]] of the space. Outside these conditions it seems more or less obvious that the 'grounds' for situation escape our grasp. At the same time, architects are conscious that it is precisely the implicit nature of ground as a structure of references that makes the task of its architectural exploration so difficult.

Moreover, according to Vesely, the notion of 'ground' can never provide us with an absolute knowledge of the whole, but only with a mediated understanding of spatial structure. This means that the task of uncovering the hidden nature of ground becomes, a fortiori, one of looking for a provisional ground that is beyond gravity as a natural source of spatial reference. The first long-term programme dealing with the consequences of the absence of gravity was developed already in 1973 by the [[NASA]] [[Skylab]]. Vesely reports how one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the astronauts is the constant loss of orientation that becomes a general difficulty in recognizing previously known situations. Without gravity, an otherwise familiar compartment would be unrecognizable if not seen from a particular angle. The Sky Lab experience seems to illustrate quite well how the phenomenon of spatial structure and situation comes to be known through a sequence of approximations. Without the right orientation, simple recognition such as finding objects in their right places would become an almost impossible task. Once found the right orientation towards objects, however, the entire spatial frame of the compartment was recognized and so would all objects in their right places and relative positions. In a situation without light or gravity, one of the Sky Lab astronauts also described how a single touch on one of the walls of the space compartment would be sufficient to enact the knowledge of the relative position of the body with respect to all objects (pp.&amp;nbsp;52–54). This seems to be particularly relevant to show how a particular point of visual or tactile reference can provide with orientation; a physiognomic recognition of the space; and be related to the spatial disposition of the whole. These are instances that, according to Vesely, constitute a continuity of spatial reference and an epistemological, provisional ground. As it arises in the continuity of understanding the potential structure of the space, the notion of ground seems to be of a projective nature (p.&amp;nbsp;103).

=== The continuity of reference ===
Vesely seems to confer a projective ability on spatiality that is thus knowable from its own potential to generate a situation. According to Vesely, the continuity of reference to ground exists within a permanent tension with the actual space, a continuity which under certain conditions may be disrupted and even destroyed (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56). The fact that there are discrepancies between different levels of representation should perhaps be no surprise as it is the case of the above-mentioned examples of reading a map, or orienting oneself in a space under zero gravity. That there is discrepancy between the given representation of a space and the actual space is in fact a common datum of everyday experience. The question is not to be solved, although it may constitute one important point of departure to understand the phenomenon of representation. This is particularly the case of extreme conditions where the phenomenon of 'continuity' is no longer recognizable. In the cases of [[aphasia]] and [[apraxia]], which rank among others of what is generally known as mental blindness, there is a blatant discontinuity between the possibilities of notional understanding and the actual performance of a purposive act or standard articulation of speech. The work and research that has been carried out on mental blindness tends to show that the ability to articulate both speech and purposive actions and gestures is nonetheless affected by the surrounding environment, and is not based upon mental impairment alone. On the contrary, it has become increasingly clear that such conditions do not take place solely as a result of mental functions; neither can they be enacted by the situational structure, as both contribute to the failure and success of treatment (p.&amp;nbsp;57).
	
Vesely brings the argument about these conditions back to the experiments regarding orientation, such as the inverted vision experiment and orientation under zero gravity conditions, and correlates it with the problems experienced with mental blindness. This is because of the fundamental knowledge of spatiality that is at stake that enables a possible representation to be actually effected. As regards spatiality, Vesely presupposes an existing continuity between the possible and the actual spatial configuration, as a mediated structure (p.&amp;nbsp;58). This understanding of representation seems to reverberate [[Husserl]]'s phenomenological treatment of representation, as moving from the horizon of vague, informal representation (''Vorstellung''), through a number of possibilities (''Vergegenwärtigungen''), until it finally reaches actuality (''Repräsentation''). The fact that [[Husserl]] only used the word ''Repräsentation'' to deal with explicit forms of representation, may serve us as an example of how a whole representational process was being kept in the background. Husserl's process of representation shows that our knowledge of spatiality intakes different levels of articulation, which are not always as clearly defined as we would wish. This means that the ground and point of departure of explicit references is not a point of departure towards a growing, cumulative knowledge of situation, but is rather a 'coming back' into a prereflective world of experience. In this sense, representation takes place as a spectrum ranging out of explicit forms of articulation into an implicit background, a concept that seems to be confirmed by later [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of perception. It seems obvious that, because of the nature of this prereflective ground, verbal or visual articulation of it cannot take place in an explicit sense. On the contrary, the phenomenological gaze at this background takes place indirectly (p.&amp;nbsp;69) as a preunderstanding of the world. If this is so, then not only our epistemological ground is constituted as an identity of interpretation of different levels of [[perception]], but also the concept of representation as such is constituted as a movement out of a prereflective background. This is precisely the background against which it becomes possible for an articulated structure to take place and be identified as such (pp.&amp;nbsp;75–77). This also means that the difference between different levels of articulation, namely between a preunderstanding background and a given object is precisely what allows us to see the object and situate it within our world of experience. If we accept Vesely's argument, then the difference that formerly stood as an epistemological barrier now becomes a necessary condition for representation to take place.

=== The latent world of architecture ===
Vesely addresses the preunderstanding of world as a ''latent world'' (p.&amp;nbsp;83), that is potentially articulated and structured, and whose relationship to its visible manifestation is not immediate. The reciprocity between this prearticulated level and its visible articulation dwells within the very ontological difference that has been discussed previously. Such reciprocity is a schematic constituent of phenomena of continuity and metaphoricity, that have been constantly described throughout the primary tradition of Christian humanism in the nature of [[being]] and [[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]]. Vesely thus enters the core of the question of representation in terms of its coming into the level of visibility. In the sequence of Vesely's argument, the subject of visibility becomes then, of itself, problematic in nature as it intakes a background of potential articulation.

According to Vesely, "the horizon of visibility displays a synthesis of the prereflective experience and of the achievements of reflection insofar as they preserve ontological continuity with the visible" (p.&amp;nbsp;85). On the other hand, the rise onto the explicit level of visibility primarily seems to express the problem of representation in terms of what is kept from the prereflective world. This could perhaps be seen as a consequence of the traditional concept of inner representation as relating to an external reality. Vesely challenges this concept of representation, and widens it as a spectrum that ranges from the explicitness of our world down to implicit levels of articulation. Consequently, the term reality is restricted mostly to certain types of representation (e.g. [[virtual reality]]) that view reality as something extrinsic (pp.&amp;nbsp;308–315).
	
Vesely's concept of representation, however, takes place in terms of a communication between a wide range of levels; whereby the question that concerns representation also concerns the [[truth]] of representation, a question that has been amply developed by modern [[hermeneutics]]. In this domain, the visible world conveys a kind of knowledge of the prereflective levels of articulation that also jeopardizes the epistemological status of the visible. As we have seen, contrary to empiricist belief, the visible world by itself does not constitute an epistemological ground (pp.&amp;nbsp;84–86). Instead, our epistemological ground is constituted by features such as orientation, [[physiognomy]], and the relative position of things with regard to one another; and it is from these features that a provisional ground comes to be constituted as regards spatiality. This ground is not a still point of reference. On the contrary, by ground is here meant a source and stream of references. This means that the explicit horizon of the visible, tangible world is the most explicit form of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] we have, but such a narrow horizon we can only take as a point of departure if we want to understand the rest of our world that is largely beyond visibility. This also means that the visible holds a very important part as a symbolic representation of our world, enabling us to see and imagine beyond the visible.

Finally, this means that we construe our knowledge of 'world' largely on the basis of invisible, implicit references which are only symbolically re-enacted by the visible realm. The level of visual representation may perhaps be compared to the level of more explicit verbal articulation as regards the implicit, preverbal domain of knowledge. Just as visual representation, verbal articulation has the power to emancipate from the given world, and the freedom to convey any meaning. This is a power bestowed upon representation, allowing it to withdraw from its original symbolic domain, thus establishing a tension between the instrumental nature of representation and its larger symbolic field.

'''Dendroclimatology''' is the science of determining past [[climate]]s from [[tree]]s (primarily properties of the annual [[tree rings]]). Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum [[latewood]] density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous.  By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates.

==Advantages==
Tree rings are especially useful as climate [[proxy (climate)|proxies]] in that they can be well-dated via [[dendrochronology]], i.e. matching of the rings from sample to sample.  This allows extension backwards in time using deceased tree samples, even using samples from buildings or from archeological digs.  Another advantage of tree rings is that they are clearly demarked in annual increments, as opposed to other proxy methods such as [[borehole]]s.  Furthermore, tree rings respond to multiple climatic effects (temperature, moisture, cloudiness), so that various aspects of climate (not just temperature) can be studied.  However, this can be a double-edged sword.

==Limitations==
Along with the advantages of dendroclimatology are some limitations:  [[confounding variable|confounding factors]], geographic coverage, annular resolution, and collection difficulties.  The field has developed various methods to partially adjust for these challenges. 

===Confounding factors===
There are multiple climate and non-climate factors as well as [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] effects that impact tree ring width.  Methods to isolate single factors (of interest) include botanical studies to calibrate growth influences and sampling of "limiting stands" (those expected to respond mostly to the variable of interest).

====Climate factors====
Climate factors that affect trees include temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and wind.  To differentiate among these factors, scientists collect information from "limiting stands."  An example of a limiting stand is the upper elevation treeline: here, trees are expected to be more affected by temperature variation (which is "limited") than precipitation variation (which is in excess).  Conversely, lower elevation treelines are expected to be more affected by precipitation changes than temperature variation.  This is not a perfect work-around as multiple factors still impact trees even at the "limiting stand," but it helps.  In theory, collection of samples from nearby limiting stands of different types (e.g. upper and lower treelines on the same mountain) should allow mathematical solution for multiple climate factors.  

====Non-climate factors====
Non-climate factors include soil, tree age, fire, tree-to-tree competition, genetic differences, logging or other human disturbance, herbivore impact (particularly sheep grazing), pest outbreaks, disease, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), the best solution is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise.  Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods:  either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization).  Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites undisturbed by modern man.

====Non-linear effects====
In general, climatologists assume a linear dependence of ring width on the variable of interest (e.g. moisture).  However, if the variable changes enough, response may level off or even turn opposite.  The home gardener knows that one can underwater or overwater a house plant.  In addition, it is possible that interaction effects may occur (for example "temperature times precipitation" may affect growth as well as temperature and precipitation on their own.  Here, also, the "limiting stand" helps somewhat to isolate the variable of interest.  For instance, at the upper treeline, where the tree is "cold limited", it's unlikely that nonlinear effects of high temperature ("inverted quadratic") will have numerically significant impact on ring width over the course of a growing season.

====Botanical inferences to correct for confounding factors====
Botanical studies can help to estimate the impact of confounding variables and in some cases guide corrections for them.  These experiments may be either ones where growth variables are all controlled (e.g. in a [[greenhouse]]{{cn|date=November 2012}}), partially controlled (e.g. FACE [Free Airborne Concentration Enhancement] experiments—add ref), or where conditions in nature are monitored.  In any case, the important thing is that multiple growth factors are carefully recorded to determine what impacts growth.  (Insert Fennoscandanavia paper reference).  With this information, ring width response can be more accurately understood and inferences from historic (unmonitored) tree rings become more certain.  In concept, this is like the limiting stand principle, but it is more quantitative—like a calibration.

====Divergence problem====
{{Main|Divergence problem}}
The divergence problem is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the [[thermometer]]s (instrumental temperatures) on one side, and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood density or width of tree rings on the other side, at many treeline sites in northern forests.

While the rendering and analysis of data from thermometer records largely suggest a substantial warming trend, tree rings from these particular sites do not display a corresponding change in their maximum latewood density or, in some cases, their width. This does not apply to all such studies.&lt;ref name=Darrigo&gt;{{cite journal | last = D'Arrigo  | first = Rosanne
| last2=Wilson | first2=Rob | last3=Liepert | first3=Beate | last4=Cherubini | first4=Paolo | title = On the ‘Divergence Problem’ in Northern Forests: A review of the tree-ring evidence and possible causes | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 60 | pages = 289–305 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~liepert/pdf/DArrigo_etal.pdf | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2007.03.004 | format =PDF |bibcode = 2008GPC....60..289D }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where this applies, a temperature trend extracted from tree rings alone would not show any substantial warming.  The temperature graphs calculated from instrumental temperatures and from these tree ring proxies  thus "diverge" from one another since the 1950s, which is the origin of the term. This divergence raises obvious questions of whether other, unrecognized divergences have occurred in the past, prior to the era of thermometers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2006 |isbn=0-309-10225-1 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence suggesting that the divergence is caused by human activities, and so confined to the recent past, but use of affected proxies can lead to overestimation of past temperatures, understating the current warming trend. There is continuing research into explanations and ways to reconcile this the discrepancy between analysis of tree ring data and thermometer based data.&lt;ref name=Darrigo /&gt;

===Geographic coverage===
Trees do not cover the Earth. [[Polar climate|Polar]] and marine climates cannot be estimated from tree rings. In perhumid tropical regions, [[Australia]] and [[southern Africa]], trees generally grow all year round and don't show clear annual rings. In some forest areas, the tree growth is too much influenced by multiple factors (no "limiting stand") to allow clear climate reconstruction{{Examples|date=September 2011}}. The coverage difficulty is dealt with by acknowledging it and by using other proxies (e.g. ice cores, corals) in difficult areas.  In some cases it can be shown that the parameter of interest (temperature, precipitation, etc.) varies similarly from area to area, for example by looking at patterns in the instrumental record.  Then one is justified in extending the dendroclimatology inferences to areas where no suitable tree ring samples are obtainable.

===Annular resolution===
Tree rings show the impact on growth over an entire growing season.  Climate changes deep in the dormant season (winter) will not be recorded.  In addition, different times of the growing season may be more important than others (i.e. May versus September) for ring width.  However, in general the ring width is used to infer the overall climate change during the corresponding year (an approximation).  Another problem is "memory" or [[autocorrelation]].  A stressed tree may take a year or two to recover from a hard season.  This problem can be dealt with by more complex modeling (a "lag" term in the regression) or by reducing the skill estimates of chronologies.

===Collection difficulties===
Tree rings must be obtained from nature, frequently from remote regions.  This means that special efforts are needed to map sites properly.  In addition, samples must be collected in difficult (often sloping terrain) conditions.  Generally, tree rings are collected using a hand-held borer device, that requires skill to get a good sample.  The best samples come from felling a tree and sectioning it.  However, this requires more danger and does damage to the forest.  It may not be allowed in certain areas, particularly with the oldest trees in undisturbed sites (which are the most interesting scientifically).  As with all experimentalists, dendroclimatologists must, at times, decide to make the best of imperfect data, rather than resample.  This tradeoff is made more difficult, because sample collection (in the field) and analysis (in the lab) may be separated significantly in time and space.  These collection challenges mean that data gathering is not as simple or cheap as conventional laboratory science.

==Other measurements==
Initial work focused on measuring the [[tree ring]] width—this is simple to measure and can be related to climate parameters.  But the annual growth of the tree leaves other traces.  In particular ''maximum latewood density'' (MXD) is another metric used for estimating environmental variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian H. |last=Luckman |title=Tree Rings as Temperature Proxies |format=PDF |work=2008 Gussow-Nuna Geoscience Conference |publisher=cspg.org |url=http://www.cspg.org/documents/Conventions/Archives/Gussow/2008Gussow/015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, harder to measure.  Other properties (e.g. isotope or chemical trace analysis) have also been tried most notably by L. M. Libby in her 1974 paper "Temperature Dependence of Isotope Ratios in Tree Rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libby|Pandolfi|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, multiple measurements on the same ring will allow differentiation of confounding factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature).  However, most studies are still based on ring widths at limiting stands.

Measuring [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] concentrations in tree rings has proven to be useful in recreating past [[sunspot]] activity, with data now extending back over 11,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">''' Educational anthropology''', or the '''anthropology of education''', is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is widely associated with the pioneering work of [[Margaret Mead]] and later, [[George Spindler]], [[Solon Kimball]], and [[Dell Hymes]].  It gained traction as a field of study during the 1970s, particularly due to professors at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].  As the name would suggest, the focus of educational anthropology is on education, although an anthropological approach to education tends to focus on the cultural aspects of education, including informal as well as formal education. As education involves understandings of who we are, it is not surprising that the single most recognized dictum of educational anthropology is that the field is centrally concerned with cultural transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Comitas, L. and Dolgin, J. 1979. 'On Anthropology and Education: Retrospect and Prospect'. Anthropology and Education Quarterly. 9(1): 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural transmission]] involves the transfer of a sense of identity between generations, sometimes known as [[enculturation]]&lt;ref&gt;Page, J.S. Education and Acculturation on Malaita: An Ethnography of Intraethnic and Interethnic Affinities'.

[[Empathy]] has been studied in the context of [[online communities]] as it pertains to enablers of interpersonal communication, [[Internet anonymity|anonymity]], as well as barriers to online relationships, such as ambiguity, [[cyberbullying]] and [[Internet troll]]ing.
It has been found that on online health support communities members tend to exhibit higher levels of empathic concern.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reading other minds: Effects of literature on empathy|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/ssol/2013/00000003/00000001/art00006|journal = Scientific Study of Literature|date = 2013-01-01|access-date = 2015-04-20|pages = 28–47|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1075/ssol.3.1.06dji|first = Maja|last = Djikic|first2 = Keith|last2 = Oatley|first3 = Mihnea C.|last3 = Moldoveanu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathic Exchanges in Online Cancer Support Groups: Distinguishing Message Expression and Reception Effects|journal = Health Communication|date = February 28, 2011|issn = 1041-0236|pmid = 21318917|pages = 185–197|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10410236.2010.544283|first = Jeong Yeob|last = Han|first2 = Dhavan V.|last2 = Shah|first3 = Eunkyung|last3 = Kim|first4 = Kang|last4 = Namkoong|first5 = Sun-Young|last5 = Lee|first6 = Tae Joon|last6 = Moon|first7 = Rich|last7 = Cleland|first8 = Q.

== Comparison/contrast with empathy in offline environments ==
A number of studies have explored the importance of empathy in offline settings. For example, one study found that mindfulness and acceptance-based behavioral approaches may have potential for increasing empathy in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The case for mindfulness-based approaches in the cultivation of empathy: Does nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness increase capacity for perspective-taking and empathic concern?|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2007.00034.x|pmid = 17935532|access-date = |volume=33 |issue = 4|pages=501–16 | last1 = Block-Lerner | first1 = J | last2 = Adair | first2 = C | last3 = Plumb | first3 = JC | last4 = Rhatigan | first4 = DL | last5 = Orsillo | first5 = SM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work has explored the link between fiction and empathy, suggesting that the experience-taking quality of fiction may increase empathy among readers.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/libby/lab/Publications_files/Kaufman%26Libby2012.pdf|title = Changing beliefs and behavior through experience-taking|last = Kaufman; Libby|first = Geoff; LK|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0027525|pmid = 22448888|access-date =|volume=103|issue = 1|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that individuals tend to more readily feel empathy for those that they view as similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | access-date=2015-04-20 | url=http://spr.sagepub.com/content/20/3/267 | title=Empathy as an Interpersonal Phenomenon | date=June 1, 2003 | last=Håkansson | first=Jakob | last2=Montgomery | first2=Henry | journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=267–284 | issn=0265-4075 | doi=10.1177/0265407503020003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In online contexts, several researchers have pointed out that there are some key differences in how users interact online that may affect levels of empathy. For example, communication in online forum communities interact asynchronously, and are generally text-based rather than verbal communications.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Internet and Health Communication: Experiences and Expectations|url = https://books.google.com/?id=plZ2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+Empathy+Online&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+empathy+online|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = 2000-11-17|access-date = 2015-04-20|isbn = 9781452264424|first = Ronald E.|last = Rice|first2 = James E.|last2 = Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishment of trust in online communities may also operate differently in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patterns of Empathy in Online Communication|publisher = ACM|date = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59593-593-9|pages = 919–928|series = CHI '07|doi = 10.1145/1240624.1240763|first = Ulrike|last = Pfeil|first2 = Panayiotis|last2 = Zaphiris|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, communications related interactions with others online might facilitate empathy while video or online gaming might negatively affect empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, L. Mark, Spradlin, A., Bunce, J. P., &amp; Rosen, L. D. (2015). Virtual empathy: Positive and negative effects of going online upon empathy in young adults, Computers in Human Behavior, 52, 39-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enablers ==
* '''Anonymity. '''The anonymous nature of many online communities can allow individuals to feel more comfortable disclosing more personal information, which in turn can increase feelings of trust, connectedness and empathy.&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;
* '''Shared interests. '''Because empathy tends to be strongest among those that share common experiences, the presence of niche online communities can set the stage for higher levels of empathy among members.''' '''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Barriers ==
* '''[[Cyberbullying]]''' is any bullying that takes place using electronic media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cyberbullying|url = http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/|website = Stopbullying.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-20| publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|date = 2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' '''Studies have suggested that individuals who are bystanders, that is, witnessing someone bullying someone else, are less likely to intervene in online contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cyberbullying among Adolescent Bystanders: Role of the Communication Medium, Form of Violence, and Empathy | doi=10.1002/casp.2137|volume=23|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|pages=37–51|year = 2013 |last1 = Barlińska |first1 = Julia | last2=Szuster| first2=Anna| last3=Winiewski| first3=Mikołaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Internet trolling]]''' is "the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive, or disruptive manner in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose." Although empirical research on trolling is limited, studies have suggested that internet trolling may be a space occupied by already-sadistic individuals who can easily disrupt conversations and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Trolls just want to have fun|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000324|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016|volume=67|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|pages=97–102|year = 2014|last1 = Buckels|first1 = Erin E.|last2 = Trapnell|first2 = Paul D.|last3 = Paulhus|first3 = Delroy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;              
* '''Ambiguity.''' Because asynchronous, text-mediated online conversations lack the richness of interaction and cues that face-to-face interaction provides, online communication tends to be much more ambiguous. This ambiguity may decrease members' abilities to find similarities in one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Getting to know you: Face-to-face versus online interactions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321000213X|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.017|volume=27|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|pages=153–159|year = 2011|last1 = Okdie|first1 = Bradley M.|last2 = Guadagno|first2 = Rosanna E.|last3 = Bernieri|first3 = Frank J.|last4 = Geers|first4 = Andrew L.|last5 = McLarney-Vesotski|first5 = Amber R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both online and offline interactions, increased perceived similarity is associated with increased empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = (Preece J.)

'''Erhard Blankenburg''' (October 30, 1938 – March 28, 2018) was a German sociologist, specializing in the [[sociology of law]].
[[File:Erhard Blankenburg.jpg|thumb|Erhard Blankenburg (2013)]]

== Education and Career ==
Blankenburg studied philosophy, sociology and German literature at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the Free University Berlin. He received an MA from the University of Oregon (1965) and a PhD (D.Phil.) from the University of Basel (1966). After working as an assistant to the sociologist [[Heinrich Popitz]] at the University of Freiburg (1966-1968), he received there his [[habilitation]] (1974). From 1975 to 1980, Blankenburg worked at the renowned [[Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung|Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin]]. In 1980 he became professor of sociology of law at the [[Free University Amsterdam]]

In the 1970s, he was, along with [[Wolfgang Kaupen]], [[Rüdiger Lautmann]] and [[Volkmar Gessner]], instrumental in reviving sociology of law in Germany. There, he was among the founders of the "Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie", still the leading journal in the German socio-legal community. He also played a role in establishing the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]]. In 1991, together with [[Bill Felstiner]], he organized the first joint meeting of the [[Law and Society Association]] and the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]], the two leading organizations of socio-legal scholars in Amsterdam. His research covered a broad range of socio-legal topics, with an interest in describing and comparing legal cultures at the centre.

In 2005, Blankenburg received, at the annual conference of the Research Committee on Sociology of Law in Paris, the [[Adam Podgórecki]] Prize "for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research".
"Blankenburg has given us an important body of work. It is work that is (and should be) extremely influential in the field; and no respectable sociologist of law  can afford to ignore it. For this he deserves out thanks and our congratulation" (Friedman 1998, 386).

In [[textual criticism]], an '''exemplar''' is the text used to produce another text. In the study of the history of a text an especially important exemplar is that which precedes any split in the tradition of that text, that is, before significant textual variations occur in different versions--such an exemplar is called an [[Archetype (disambiguation)|archetype]].

'''Geriatric sexology''' is the systematic study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in the elderly. It encompasses all aspects of sexuality, including attempting to characterise "normal sexuality" and its variants, including [[paraphilia]]s and disorders of or relating to [[sex]] and the [[sex organ]]s. The field covers [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of sexuality and its disorders.

'''Gibraltar 2''', also known as '''Devil's Tower Child''', represented five skull fragments of a female [[Neanderthal]] child discovered in the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. The discovery of the [[fossils]] at the [[Devil's Tower (Gibraltar)|Devil's Tower]] [[Mousterian]] [[rock shelter]] was made by [[archaeologist]] [[Dorothy Garrod]] in 1926. It represented the second [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of a Neanderthal skull in Gibraltar, after [[Gibraltar 1]], the second Neanderthal skull ever found (after [[Engis 2]]). In the early twenty-first century,{{when|date=July 2017}} Gibraltar 2 underwent reconstruction.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The fossil, an adult female skull, is referred to as [[Gibraltar 1]] or the Gibraltar Skull ''(pictured at left)''. Neanderthals were unknown at the time that the fossil was found. Lieutenant Flint, secretary of the Gibraltar Scientific Society, presented his discovery to the organisation on 3 March 1848.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt; Eight years later, in 1856, fossils were discovered in a cave of the [[Neander Valley]] near [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]].

However, it wasn't until the early twentieth century{{when|date=July 2017}} that it was realized{{by whom|date=July 2017}} that Gibraltar 1 was the skull of a Neanderthal.

==Discovery of Gibraltar 2==
[[File:Dorothy Garrod.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Archaeologist]] [[Dorothy Garrod]] discovered Gibraltar 2 in 1926.]]
{{History of Gibraltar}}
Additional evidence of Neanderthal occupation in Gibraltar was found at the Devil's Tower Mousterian rock shelter, also at the north face of the Rock of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=geology/&gt;&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt; Devil's Tower was a seventeenth century [[watchtower]] which was located at the eastern end of Devil's Tower Road.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt; The archaeological site was initially discovered by Abbé [[Henri Breuil|Henri Édouard Prosper Breuil]] (1877 &amp;ndash; 1961), who had recommended investigation. Breuil, a French [[paleontologist]] and archaeologist, is renowned for his expertise on prehistoric cave art.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The excavations at the Devil's Tower cave started in November 1925 and continued until December 1926 in three phases. In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child was discovered by archaeologist [[Dorothy Garrod]].&lt;ref name=hominid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mousterian&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dorothy A.E.

She was the first female professor at both the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. In addition, in 1939, Garrod was elected to the Disney Chair.&lt;ref name=biographies&gt;{{cite web|title=Biographies – Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod, 1892–1968|url=http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about-newnham/college-history/biographies/content/dorothy-garrod|work=newn.cam.ac.uk|publisher=[[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Garrod found five skull fragments which were described by the archaeologist and others in ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' in 1928. The five fragments were [[maxilla]]ry, [[parietal bone|parietal]], [[temporal bone|temporal]], [[cranium|cranial]], and [[mandible|mandibular]].&lt;ref name=mousterian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nespos/&gt;&lt;ref name=zurich&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer-Assisted Paleoanthropology|url=http://www.aim.uzh.ch/morpho/wiki//CAP/N3|work=aim.uzh.ch|publisher=University of Zurich|accessdate=12 October 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mousterian [[flake tools|flake stone tools]] were found near the child's remains.

In a study described in 1993 in the ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', the striation pattern of the [[tooth enamel|dental enamel]] of the Devil's Tower Child fossil was compared to that of modern [[hunter-gatherers]] and [[medieval]] individuals from [[Spain]]. It was found that the Devil's Tower Child had a more [[abrasive]] diet than medieval individuals. Gibraltar 2 had a high number of striations. Further, the ratio of horizontal to vertical striations suggested that Gibraltar 2 may have been primarily [[carnivorous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author2=Pérez-Pérez, A |title=The diet of the Neanderthal Child Gibraltar 2 (Devil's Tower) through the study of the vestibular striation pattern |journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]] |date=January 1993 |volume=24 |issue=1 |author=Fox, C.

By 2008, the face of the Devil's Tower Child had been reconstructed ''(pictured below)'' at the [[University of Zurich]] by means of computer-assisted [[paleoanthropology]] (CAP). This involved using [[computed tomography]] (CT) to perform volume data acquisition of the five skull fragments unearthed by Garrod in 1926. The five cranial fragments were then transformed with the software FoRM-IT into virtual 3D images. With the five virtual images then suspended in anatomical space according to scientific criteria, the missing fragments were replaced with [[mirror images]] of the excavated fragments. By means of [[laser]] [[stereolithography]], the virtual reconstruction of the face and skull of the Devil's Tower Child was converted to a physical model. The soft tissues were then approximated using 3D Thin Plate Splining (TPS) with data from a modern child. [[Plasticine]] modelling clay was accordingly applied on the physical model to simulate soft tissue. The final model of Gibraltar 2 was then cast; finishing touches included paint and human hair ''(link to final image below)''.&lt;ref name=zurich/&gt;

==Earlier claims of Gibraltar as a refugium==
At the end of the 20th century, it was believed that the Neanderthals disappeared ''c.'' 35,000 years ago. In 2006, radiocarbon dating of charcoal from [[Gorham's Cave]], Gibraltar, suggested that Neanderthals survived in southern Spain and Gibraltar at least to 28,000 BP, well after the arrival of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' in Europe ''c.'' 45,000 years ago. More recently, new decontaminated radiocarbon dating (from the same Oxford laboratory that published the late date in 2006) suggests Neanderthals had vacated Gibraltar by 42,000 BP, earlier than elsewhere in Europe.

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

The '''HH-suite''' is an open-source software package for sensitive [[protein]] sequence searching. It contains programs that can search for similar protein sequences in protein sequence databases. Sequence searches are a standard tool in modern biology with which the function of unknown proteins can be inferred from the functions of proteins with similar sequences. 

==Sequence searches in biology==

Proteins are central players in all of life's processes. To understand how life in cells is organised, we have to understand what each of the proteins involved in these molecular processes does. This is particularly important in order to understand the origin of diseases. But for a large fraction of the approximately 20 000 human proteins the structures and functions remain unknown. Many proteins have been investigated in model organisms such as many bacteria, baker's yeast, fruit flies, zebra fish or mice, for which experiments can be often done more easily than with human cells. To predict the function, structure, or other properties of a protein for which only its sequence of amino acids is known, the protein sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases. If a protein with sufficiently similar sequence is found, the two proteins are likely to be evolutionarily related ([[Homology (biology)#Sequence homology|"homologous"]]). In that case, they are likely to share similar structures and functions. Therefore, if a protein with a sufficiently similar sequence and with known functions and/or structure can be found by the sequence search, the unknown protein's functions, structure, and domain composition can be predicted.  Such predictions greatly facilitate the determination of the function or structure by targeted validation experiments.

==Description==

The HH-suite  [[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]]  contains HHsearch
&lt;ref name="pmid15531603"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Söding J | title = Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison | journal = Bioinformatics | year =  2005 | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 951–960 | pmid = 15531603 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and HHblits 
&lt;ref name="pmid22198341"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Remmert M, Biegert A, Hauser A, Söding J | title = HHblits: Lightning-fast iterative protein sequence searching by HMM-HMM alignment. | journal = Nat. Methods | year =  2011 | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–175 | pmid = 22198341 | doi = 10.1038/NMETH.1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
among other programs and utilities. HHsearch is among the most popular methods for the detection of remotely related sequences and for protein structure prediction, having been cited over 2000 times in Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=hhsearch+soeding Number of citations to HHsearch on Google Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; The HHsearch and HHblits programs owe their power to the fact that both the query and the database sequences are represented by [[multiple sequence alignment]]s (MSAs). In these MSAs, the query or database sequence is written in a table together with homologous (related) sequences in such a way that each column contains homologous amino acid residues, that is, residues that have descended from the same residue in the ancestral sequence. The frequencies of amino acids in the columns of such an MSA can be interpreted as probabilities to observe an amino acid in a further homologous sequence at that position. To facilitate automatic scoring of potential sequences for their relatedness to the sequences in the MSA, the MSAs are succinctly described by profile [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs). These are extensions of [[position-specific scoring matrix|''position-specific scoring matrices'']] (PSSMs). The core algorithms for '''H'''MM-'''H'''MM alignment give HH-suite its name.

[[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]] takes as input a [[multiple sequence alignment]] or a profile [[hidden Markov Model]] (HMM) and searches a database of profile HMMs for homologous (related) proteins. 
[[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]] is often used for [[homology modeling]], that is, to build a model of the structure of a query protein for which only the sequence is known: For that purpose, a database of proteins with known structures such as the [[Protein Data Bank|protein data bank]] is searched for "template" proteins similar to the query protein. If such a template protein is found, the structure of the protein of interest can be predicted based on a pairwise [[multiple sequence alignment|sequence alignment]] of the query with the template protein sequence. In the [[CASP| CASP9]] protein structure prediction competition in 2010, a fully automated version of HHpred based on HHsearch and HHblits was ranked best out of 81 servers in template-based structure prediction [http://predictioncenter.org/casp9/groups_analysis.cgi?type=server&amp;tbm=on&amp;tbmfm=on&amp;submit=Filter CASP9 TBM/FM].

[[File:HHblits-Schematic.png|thumb|Iterative sequence search scheme of HHblits]]
HHblits was added to the HH-suite in 2011. It can build high-quality [[multiple sequence alignment]]s (MSAs) starting from a single query sequence or MSA. From the query, a profile HMM can be calculated. By using MSAs instead of single sequences, the sensitivity of sequence searches and the quality of the resulting sequence alignments can be improved dramatically. MSAs are also the starting point for a multitude of downstream computational methods, such as methods to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins, to predict their molecular functions or cellular pathways, to predict the positions in their sequence or structure that contribute to enzymatic activity or ligand-binding, to predict evolutionarily conserved residues, disease-causing versus neutral mutations, the proteins' cellular localization and many more. This explains the importance to produce MSAs of the highest quality.

HHblits works similarly to [[PSI-BLAST]], the most popular iterative sequence search method. HHblits generates a profile HMM from the query sequence and iteratively searches through a large database of profile HMMs, such as HH-suite's uniprot20 database. The uniprot20 database contains all public, high-quality protein sequences that are collected in the [[UniProt]] database. These sequences are clustered and aligned into multiple sequence alignments, from which the profile HMMs in uniprot20 are generated. Significantly similar sequences from the previous search are added to the query profile HMM for the next search iteration. Compared to [[PSI-BLAST]] and [[HMMER]], HHblits is faster, up to twice as sensitive and produces more accurate alignments.&lt;ref name="pmid22198341"/&gt; HHblits uses the same HMM-HMM alignment algorithms as HHsearch, but it employs a fast prefilter that reduces the number of database HMMs for which to perform the slow HMM-HMM comparison from tens of millions to a few thousands.

The HH-suite comes with a number of useful databases of profile HMMs that can be searched using HHblits and HHsearch, among them a clustered version of the [[UniProt| UniProt database]], HMMs for the [[Protein Data Bank|protein data bank]] of protein structures, for the [[Pfam| Pfam database]] of protein family alignments, the [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|SCOP database]] of structural protein domains, and many more.

The HH-suite runs on most Linux and Unix distributions, including RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X. A [[Debian]] package is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/hhsuite Debian hhsuite package]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of programs in HH-suite ==

In addition to HHsearch and HHblits, the HH-suite contains programs and perl scripts for format conversion, filtering of MSAs, generation of profile HMMs, the addition of secondary structure predictions to MSAs, the extraction of alignments from program output, and the generation of customized databases.

'''Human height''' or '''stature''' is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a [[human body]], standing erect. It is measured using a [[stadiometer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadiometers and Height Measurement Devices|url=https://www.stadiometer.com/|website=stadiometer.com|publisher=stadiometer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in centimetres when using the [[metric system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the BMI-for-Age Growth Charts |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |website=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Center for Disease Control]] |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130012800/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |archivedate=30 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Price, Beth|title=MathsWorld Year 8 VELS Edition|date=2009|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]]|location=Australia|page=626|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2veDRPjMggC&amp;printsec=frontcover|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or feet and inches when using the [[imperial system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lapham, Robert  |author2=Agar, Heather |title=Drug Calculations for Nurses|date=2009|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=USA|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1_vAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Pamela J.|title=Lippincott's Textbook for Nursing Assistants: A Humanistic Approach to Caregiving|date=2008|publisher=[[Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=USA|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=biM2u4JfxZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular genetic profile in men called [[Haplogroup I-M170|Y haplotype I-M170]] is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with height. Ecological data shows that as the frequency of this genetic profile increases in the population, the average male height in a country also increases.

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to [[gigantism]] or [[dwarfism]], which are medical conditions caused by specific [[gene]]s or [[endocrine]] abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, William F. (2001) ''Review of Medical Physiology'', Lange Medical, pp. 392–397, {{ISBN|0071605673}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions. Some research indicates that a greater height correlates with greater success in dating and earning in men, although other research indicates that this does not apply to non-white men.&lt;ref&gt;https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-problem-with-being-tall-male-and-black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of growth and height==
[[Image:Human height growth per month, United States.png|thumb|right|300px|The median (50th percentile) growth curves for male and females 0–20 years in the United States.]]
The study of height is known as [[auxology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermanussen, Michael (ed) (2013) ''Auxology – Studying Human Growth and Development'', Schweizerbart, {{ISBN|9783510652785}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the [[health]] of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential in regard to differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness ([[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]]) of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolton-Smith | first1 = C. | title = Accuracy of the estimated prevalence of obesity from self reported height and weight in an adult Scottish population | doi = 10.1136/jech.54.2.143 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–148 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1731630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper [[Health care|medical care]] and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed.&lt;ref name=kolmos2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Komlos | first1 = J. | last2 = Baur | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2003.12.006 | title = From the tallest to (one of) the fattest: The enigmatic fate of the American population in the 20th century | journal = Economics &amp; Human Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 57–74 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15463993| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average (male) height in a nation is correlated with [[protein quality]]. Nations that consume more protein in the form of meat, [[dairy]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and [[fish]] tend to be taller, while those that attain more protein from [[cereals]] tend to be shorter.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Malnutrition including chronic undernutrition and acute malnutrition is known to have caused [[stunted growth]] in various populations.&lt;ref name="onis20122"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = De Onis | first1 = M. | last2 = Blössner | first2 = M. | last3 = Borghi | first3 = E. | doi = 10.1017/S1368980011001315 | title = Prevalence and trends of stunting among pre-school children, 1990–2020 | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–148 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21752311| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen in North Korea, parts of Africa, certain historical Europe, and other populations.&lt;ref name="grantham2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grantham-Mcgregor | first1 = S. | last2 = Cheung | first2 = Y.

Height measurements are by nature subject to statistical sampling errors even for a single individual.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} In a clinical situation, height measurements are seldom taken more often than once per office visit, which may mean sampling taking place a week to several months apart. The smooth 50th percentile male and female growth curves illustrated above are aggregate values from thousands of individuals sampled at ages from birth to age 20. In reality, a single individual's growth curve shows large upward and downward spikes, partly due to actual differences in growth velocity, and partly due to small measurement errors.

For example, a typical measurement error of plus or minus 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm may completely nullify 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm of actual growth resulting in either a "negative" 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (due to overestimation in the previous visit combined with underestimation in the latter), up to a 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (the first visit underestimating and the second visit overestimating) in the same elapsed time period between measurements. Note there is a discontinuity in the growth curves at age 2, which reflects the difference in recumbent length (with the child on his or her back), used in measuring infants and toddlers and standing height typically measured from age 2 onwards.

[[Image:Galton-height-regress.jpg|thumb|300px|Sir [[Francis Galton]]'s (1889) data showing the relationship between offspring height (928 individuals) as a function of mean parent height (205 sets of parents). The [[correlation]] was 0.57.]]
Height, like other [[phenotypic]] traits, is determined by a combination of [[genetics]] and [[environmental factor]]s. A child's height based on parental heights is subject to [[regression toward the mean]], therefore extremely tall or short parents will likely have correspondingly taller or shorter offspring, but their offspring will also likely be closer to average height than the parents themselves. Genetic potential and a number of hormones, minus illness, is a basic determinant for height. Other factors include the genetic response to external factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and life circumstances.

Humans grow fastest (other than in the womb) as [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s, rapidly declining from a maximum at birth to roughly age 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate, and then during the [[pubertal]] growth spurt, a rapid rise to a second maximum (at around 11–12 years for female, and 13–14 years for male), followed by a steady decline to zero. On average, female growth speed trails off to zero at about 15 or 16 years, whereas the male curve continues for approximately 3 more years, going to zero at about 18–19. These are also critical periods where stressors such as malnutrition (or even severe [[child neglect]]) have the greatest effect.

Moreover, the health of a mother throughout her life, especially during her critical period and [[pregnancy]], has a role. A healthier child and adult develops a body that is better able to provide optimal prenatal conditions.&lt;ref name="grantham2007" /&gt; The pregnant mother's health is important for herself but also for the fetus as [[gestation]] is itself a critical period for an [[embryo]]/[[fetus]], though some problems affecting height during this period are resolved by catch-up growth assuming childhood conditions are good. Thus, there is a cumulative generation effect such that nutrition and health over generations influences the height of descendants to varying degrees.

The age of the mother also has some influence on her child's height. Studies in modern times have observed a gradual increase in height with maternal age, though these early studies suggest that trend is due to various socio-economic situations that select certain demographics as being more likely to have a first birth early in the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n1/fig_tab/1601508t1.html#figure-title Table 1.

=== Nature versus nurture ===
The precise relationship between [[nature versus nurture|genetics and environment]] is complex and uncertain. Differences in human height is 60–80% [[Heritability|heritable]], according to several [[twin study|twin studies]]&lt;ref name=weedon&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/|title=How much of human height is genetic and how much is due to nutrition? |author=Lai, Chao-Qiang |journal=Scientific American|date=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been considered [[polygenic]] since the [[Mendelian-biometrician debate]] a hundred years ago.

The effect of environment on height is illustrated by studies performed by anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] and coworkers of Guatemala Mayan children living in the United States. In the early 1970s, when Bogin first visited [[Guatemala]], he observed that [[Mayan Indian]] men averaged only {{convert|157.5|cm|ftin|frac=2}} in height and the women averaged {{convert|142.2|cm|ftin|frac=2}}. Bogin took another series of measurements after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], during which up to a million Guatemalans fled to the United States. He discovered that Maya refugees, who ranged from six to twelve years old, were significantly taller than their Guatemalan counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 40–44 | last = Bogin | first = Barry | title = The tall and the short of it | journal = Discover | accessdate = 26 April 2013 | year = 1998 | url = http://courses.washington.edu/bioa101/articles/article38.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the American Maya were {{convert|10.24|cm|in|abbr=on}} taller than the Guatemalan Maya of the same age, largely due to better nutrition and [[health care]].&lt;ref name="bogin2003" /&gt; Bogin also noted that American Maya children had relatively longer legs, averaging {{convert|7.02|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than the Guatemalan Maya (a significantly lower sitting height ratio).&lt;ref name=bogin2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Rios | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5 | title = Rapid morphological change in living humans: Implications for modern human origins | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 136 | pages = 71–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  14527631| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krawitz, Jan |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_heightgap_04.html |title=P.O.V. – Big Enough |publisher=PBS |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of growth==
{{See also|Adolescence#Growth spurt}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Endocrine growth regulation.svg|thumb|The main pathways in the endocrine regulation of growth]]

Growth in stature, determined by its various factors, results from the lengthening of bones via cellular divisions chiefly regulated by [[somatotropin]] (human [[growth hormone]] (hGH)) secreted by the anterior [[pituitary]] gland. Somatotropin also stimulates the release of another growth inducing hormone [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) mainly by the liver. Both hormones operate on most tissues of the body, have many other functions, and continue to be secreted throughout life; with peak levels coinciding with peak growth velocity, and gradually subsiding with age after [[adolescence]]. The bulk of secretion occurs in bursts (especially for adolescents) with the largest during sleep.

The majority of linear growth occurs as growth of cartilage at the [[epiphysis]] (ends) of the [[long bone]]s which gradually [[Endochondral ossification|ossify]] to form hard bone. The legs compose approximately half of adult human height, and leg length is a somewhat [[sexually dimorphic]] trait, with men having proportionately longer legs. Some of this growth occurs after the growth spurt of the long bones has ceased or slowed. The majority of growth during growth spurts is of the long bones. Additionally, the variation in height between populations and across time is largely due to changes in leg length. The remainder of height consists of the cranium. Height is sexually dimorphic and statistically it is more or less [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], but with [[heavy tail]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 
It has been shown that a [[log-normal distribution]] fits the data equally well, besides guaranteeing a non-negative lower [[confidence limit]], which could otherwise attain a non-physical negative height value for arbitrarily large confidence levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Limpert |first1=E |last2=Stahel |first2=W |last3=Abbt |first3=M |title=Lognormal distributions across the sciences: keys and clues |journal=BioScience |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=341–352 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0341:LNDATS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most intra-population variance of height is genetic. [[Short stature]] and tall stature are usually not a health concern. If the degree of deviation from normal is significant, hereditary short stature is known as familial short stature and tall stature is known as familial tall stature. Confirmation that exceptional height is normal for a respective person can be ascertained from comparing stature of family members and analyzing growth trends for abrupt changes, among others. There are, however, various diseases and disorders that cause growth abnormalities.

Most notably, extreme height may be pathological, such as [[gigantism]] resulting from childhood hyperpituitarism, and [[dwarfism]] which has various causes. Rarely, no cause can be found for extreme height; very short persons may be termed as having [[idiopathic short stature]]. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003 approved hGH treatment for those 2.25 standard deviations below the population mean (approximately the lowest 1.2% of the population). An even rarer occurrence, or at least less used term and recognized "problem", is idiopathic tall stature.

If not enough [[growth hormone]] is produced and/or secreted by the pituitary gland, then a patient with growth hormone deficiency can undergo treatment. This treatment involves the injection of pure growth hormone into thick tissue to promote growth.

==Role of an individual's height==

===Height and health===

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain studies have shown that height is a factor in overall health while some suggest tallness is associated with better cardiovascular health and shortness with longevity.&lt;ref name="Samaras"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Samaras TT, Elrick H |title=Height, body size, and longevity: is smaller better for the humanbody? |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=206–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12016250 |pmc=1071721 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.176.3.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer risk has also been found to grow with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/07/21/height-cancer-risk.html | work=CBC News | title=Cancer risk may grow with height | date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, modern westernized interpretations of the relationship between height and health fail to account for the observed height variations worldwide.&lt;ref name=cavalli&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., &amp; Cavalli-Sforza, F., 1995, ''The Great Human Diasporas'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavalli-Sforza and Cavalli-Sforza note that variations in height worldwide can be partly attributed to evolutionary pressures resulting from differing environments. These evolutionary pressures result in height related health implications.  While tallness is an adaptive benefit in colder climates such as found in Europe, shortness helps dissipate body heat in warmer climatic regions.&lt;ref name=cavalli /&gt;  Consequently, the relationships between health and height cannot be easily generalized since tallness and shortness can both provide health benefits in different environmental settings.

At the extreme end, being excessively tall can cause various medical problems, including cardiovascular problems, because of the increased load on the heart to supply the body with blood, and problems resulting from the increased time it takes the brain to communicate with the extremities. For example, [[Robert Pershing Wadlow|Robert Wadlow]], the tallest man known to verifiable history, developed trouble walking as his height increased throughout his life. In many of the pictures of the later portion of his life, Wadlow can be seen gripping something for support. Late in his life, although he died at age 22, he had to wear braces on his legs and walk with a cane; and he died after developing an infection in his legs because he was unable to feel the irritation and cutting caused by his leg braces.

Sources are in disagreement about the overall relationship between height and longevity. Samaras and Elrick, in the Western Journal of Medicine, demonstrate an inverse correlation between height and longevity in several mammals including humans.&lt;ref name="Samaras"/&gt;

Women whose height is under {{convert|150|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} may have a small [[human pelvis|pelvis]], resulting in such complications during [[childbirth]] as [[shoulder dystocia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch258/ch258b.html|work=Merck Manual Home Edition|publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Sweden in 2005 has shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between height and suicide among Swedish men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Magnusson PK, Gunnell D, Tynelius P, Davey Smith G, Rasmussen F |title=Strong inverse association between height and suicide in a large cohort of Swedish men: evidence of early life origins of suicidal behavior? |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=7 |pages=1373–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15994722 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large body of human and animal evidence indicates that shorter, smaller bodies age slower, and have fewer chronic diseases and greater longevity. For example, a study found eight areas of support for the "smaller lives longer" thesis. These areas of evidence include studies involving longevity, life expectancy, centenarians, male vs. female longevity differences, mortality advantages of shorter people, survival findings, smaller body size due to calorie restriction, and within species body size differences. They all support the conclusion that smaller individuals live longer in healthy environments and with good nutrition. However, the difference in longevity is modest. Several human studies have found a loss of 0.5 year/centimeter of increased height (1.2 yr/inch). But these findings do not mean that all tall people die young. Many live to advanced ages and some become centenarians.&lt;ref&gt;Samaras TT 2014, Evidence from eight different types of studies showing smaller body size is related to greater longevity JSRR 3(16):2150-2160. 2014: article no. JSRR.2014.16.003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height and occupational success===
{{see also|Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States}}
There is a large body of research in psychology, economics, and [[human biology]] that has assessed the relationship between several seemingly innocuous physical features (e.g., body height) and occupational success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Body height and occupational success for actors and actresses |first=Stieger |last=Stefan |first2=Burger |last2=Christoph |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=107 |pages=25–38 |year=2010 |doi=10.2466/pr0.107.1.25-38 |pmid=20923046 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between height and success was explored decades ago.&lt;ref name="W.

In most occupational fields, body height is not relevant to how well people are able to perform; nonetheless several studies found that success was positively correlated with body height, although there may be other factors such as gender or socioeonomic status that are correlated with height which may account for the difference in success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W.

Further, growing evidence suggests that height may be a proxy for confidence, which is likewise strongly correlated with occupational success.&lt;ref&gt;Nickless, Rachel (28 November 2012) [http://www.afr.com/p/national/work_space/lifelong_confidence_rewarded_in_gSNmV78QAuqjmT8Ksy3QSJ Lifelong confidence rewarded in bigger pay packets].

The only exceptions of this rather uniform height distribution were people in the Anglo-Saxon settlement regions who were taller than the average and people from Southeast Asia with below-average heights.

The tallest living man is [[Sultan Kösen]] of [[Turkey]], at {{Height|cm=251}}. The tallest man in modern history was [[Robert Pershing Wadlow]] (1918–1940), from [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], who was {{Height|cm=272}} at the time of his death. The tallest woman in medical history was [[Zeng Jinlian]] of [[Hunan]], China, who stood {{Height|cm=248}} when she died at the age of 17. The shortest adult human on record was [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] of [[Nepal]] at {{Height|cm=54.6}}.

Adult height between populations often differs significantly. For example, the average height of women from the Czech Republic is greater than that of men from Malawi. This may be caused by genetic differences, childhood lifestyle differences (nutrition, sleep patterns, physical labor), or both.

Depending on sex, genetic and environmental factors, shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be universal in the extremely aged. This decrease in height is due to such factors as decreased height of inter-vertebral discs because of [[desiccation]], [[atrophy]] of soft tissues and postural changes secondary to degenerative disease.

According to a study in France, executives and professionals are {{Height|cm=2.6}} taller, and university students are {{Height|cm=2.55}} taller&lt;ref&gt;Although the mean height of university students are slightly shorter than the national mean height aged 20-29 in this study.&lt;/ref&gt; than the national average.&lt;ref name="insee.fr"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/es361d.pdf |title=La taille des hommes: son incidence sur la vie en couple et la carrière professionnelle |doi=10.3406/estat.2003.7355|author=Herpin, Nicolas |journal=Économie et Statistique|year= 2003|volume=361|issue =1| pages =71–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this case shows, data taken from a particular social group may not represent a total population in some countries.
* A relatively small sample of the population may have been measured, which makes it uncertain whether this sample accurately represents the entire population.
* The height of persons can vary over the course of a day, due to factors such as a height increase from exercise done directly before measurement (normally inversely correlated), or a height increase since lying down for a significant period of time (normally inversely correlated). For example, one study revealed a mean decrease of {{convert|1.54|cm|in}} in the heights of 100 children from getting out of bed in the morning to between 4 and 5 p.m. that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1545095 | pmid=568918 | volume=53 | title=Variations in height throughout the day | journal=Arch Dis Child | pages=762 | last1 = Buckler | first1 = JM | doi=10.1136/adc.53.9.762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors may not have been controlled in some of the studies.

In the Netherlands, about 35% of men have the genetic profile Y [[haplogroup I-M170]], but in Herzegovina, the frequency is over 70%. Extrapolating the genetic trend line suggests that the average Herzegovinian man could possibly be as tall as 190&amp;nbsp;cm (nearly 6′ 3″). Many Herzegovinians do not achieve this potential due to poverty (citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm taller if both of their parents went to university, which is considered as a wealth indicator) and to nutritional choices: [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|religious prohibition on pork]] may be largely to blame for the shorter average stature of Muslim Herzegovinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acsh.org/news/2017/04/12/move-over-dutch-men-herzegovinians-may-be-tallest-world-11122 "Move Over, Dutch Men.

==In formal nomenclature==
When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], stipulates that "species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations", but ranks higher than the [[genus]] may be assigned ''incertae sedis''.&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason for use==

===Poor description===
This excerpt from a 2007 [[Academic publishing|scientific paper]] about [[crustacean]]s of the [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]] and the [[Japan Trench]] describes typical circumstances through which this category is applied in discussing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Graham J. Bird |year=2007  |journal=[[Zootaxa]] |volume=1599 |pages=121–149 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01599p149.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] excerpt |editor1=K. Larsen |editor2=M. Shimomura |title=Family ''Incertae Cedis''  in Tanaidacea (Crustacea: Peracarida) from Japan III. The deep trenches; the Kurile-Kamchatka Trench and Japan Trench}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the removal of many [[genus|genera]] from new and existing [[family (biology)|families]] into a state of incertae sedis. Their reduced status was attributed largely to poor or inadequate descriptions but it was accepted that some of the vagueness in the analysis was due to insufficient character states. It is also evident that a proportion of the characters used in the analysis, or their given states for particular taxa, were inappropriate or invalid. Additional complexity, and factors that have misled earlier authorities, are intrusion by extensive [[homoplasies]], apparent character state reversals and [[convergent evolution]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Not included in an analysis===
If a formal [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis is conducted that does not include a certain taxon, the authors might choose to label the taxon ''incertae sedis'' instead of guessing its placement. This is particularly common when [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenies]] are generated, since tissue for many rare organisms is hard to obtain. It is also a common scenario when [[fossil]] taxa are included, since many fossils are defined based on partial information. For example, if the phylogeny was constructed using soft tissue and [[vertebra]]e as principal characters and the taxon in question is only known from a single tooth, it would be necessary to label it ''incertae sedis''.&lt;ref name=Matthews1973/&gt;

=== Controversy ===
If conflicting results exist or if there is not a consensus among researchers as to how a taxon relates to other organisms, it may be listed as ''incertae sedis'' until the conflict is resolved.&lt;ref name=Matthews1973/&gt;

== In zoological nomenclature ==
In botany, a name is not validly published if it is not accepted by the author in the same publication.&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Article 36.1&lt;/sup&gt; In zoology, a name proposed conditionally may be [[available name|available]] under certain conditions.&lt;ref name=ICZN/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Articles 11 and 15&lt;/sup&gt; For uncertainties at lower levels, the system of open nomenclature suggests that question marks be used to denote a questionable assignment.&lt;ref name=Matthews1973/&gt; For example, if a new species was given the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''album'' by Anton and attributed with uncertainty to ''Agenus'', it could be denoted "''Agenus? album'' Anton (?Anton)"; the "(?Anton)" indicates the author that assigned the question mark.&lt;ref name=Matthews1973/&gt; So if Anton described ''Agenus album'', and Bruno called the assignment into doubt, this could be denoted "''Agenus? album'' (Anton) (?Bruno)", with the parentheses around Anton because the original assignment (to ''Agenus'') was modified (to ''Agenus?'') by Bruno.&lt;ref name=Matthews1973/&gt;

The word "[[Value (ethics)|value]]" is both a verb and a noun, each with multiple meanings. But its root meaning always involves social judgments of qualities such as [[good]]ness, worth, [[truth]], [[justice]], [[beauty]]. The word names either the rational criterion applied when judging, or results of judging, the presence of such qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Theory of Valuation|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-3}}&lt;ref name="Tile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tiles|first1=Mary|last2=Oberdiek|first2=Hans|title=Living in a Technological Culture|publisher=Routledge|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–44}} 

Humans attribute qualities to objects, beliefs, and behaviors as they identify means that "work" to carry on [[social interaction|social life]], and ends that are "right" for social life itself.  Qualities that "work" are judged by the '''instrumental criterion''', and are said to possess instrumental value.  Qualities that are "right" in themselves are judged by the '''intrinsic criterion''', and are said to possess intrinsic value.  The value of a smart phone or a scientific theory is instrumental.  The value of the [[Ten Commandments]] or the [[US Constitution]] is intrinsic.

==Overview==
The noun value sometimes names the instrumental or intrinsic criterion being applied.  More often, it names things judged to possess instrumental or intrinsic value.  Modern scholars have refined these ancient common-sense meanings of value.  [[sociology|Sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] applied the labels instrumental and intrinsic value to two patterns of social action.  Here are his original definitions, followed by current labels for the two criteria from the ''Oxford Handbook of Value Theory''.

{{quotation
|Social action, like all action, may be [judged] ...:
     1) ''instrumentally rational'' (''zweckrational''), that is, determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as "conditions" or "means" for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends'

     2) ''value-rational'' (''wertrational''), that is, determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, [[aesthetic]], religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success;...,&lt;ref name="Max 22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–5}}}}

{{quotation
|... the distinction between what is good "in itself" and what is good "as a means."}}

{{quotation
|The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is ''valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right'', as ''an end'', or ''as such''.  By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else's sake.}}

{{quotation
|Among nonfinal values, instrumental value--intuitively, the value attaching a means to what is finally valuable--stands out as a [[bona fide]] example of what is not valuable for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirose|first1=Iwao|last2=Olson|first2=Jonas|title=The Oxford Handbook of Value Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14, 29, 34}}}}

The assumption that humans apply two distinct criteria of judgment creates problems.  People ask, "How can we know which objects have which qualities?"  Things that "work" may appear obvious, but can stop working or have bad consequences.  Things that are "right" are not-at-all obvious and are often controversial.  This article samples usages of instrumental and intrinsic value and some disputes they generate.  Evidence is drawn from the work of four scholars.

Philosopher [[John Dewey]] and economist [[John Fagg Foster]] denied legitimacy to intrinsic value.  They treated it as contaminated application of instrumental value, and showed how instrumental value alone can judge ends and means that both work and are right.  Philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]] argued that instrumental value had itself become contaminated by inhuman industrial power unregulated by intrinsic supernatural value.  Philosopher [[Anjan Chakravartty]] argued that modern [[scientific realism]] confirms the truth of intrinsic value and the fallacy of relativistic instrumental value.

To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun "value" names a criterion of judgment but not an object judged valuable.  The noun "valuation" names an object judged valuable.  The plural noun "values" identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied.

==John Dewey==
[[John Dewey]] judged the human belief in intrinsic value to be a futile and failed search for a community [[moral compass]]. He saw no need for intrinsic value because instrumental value enables human groups to coordinate beliefs and behaviors that both work and are right.  Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions that are satisfied or not.  Continuous reasoning adjusts patterns to keep them working on the right track as conditions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=John Dewey|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=152–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value contaminates instrumental value by isolating judgments of what is right from judgments of what works. For him, "restoring integration and cooperation between man's [[beliefs]] about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life."&lt;ref name="Dew 29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Quest for Certainty|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255}}  "A culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Freedom and Culture|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1963|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria.  And he agreed with Weber's observation that intrinsic value is problematic because it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors.  Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically "for its own sake" can  have operationally efficient consequences.

{{quotation
|... the more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more "irrational" in this [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is.  For the more unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake, ... the less he is influenced by considerations of the consequences of his action.&lt;ref name="Max 22"/&gt;{{rp|26, 399–400}}}}

But Dewey rejected the common belief--shared by Weber--that supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently "right."  He argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in daily life, where conditions are always changing.

{{quotation
|Man who lives in a world of hazards ... has sought to attain [security] in two ways.  One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers which environ him and determine his destiny.  It expressed itself in supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult  ....  The other course is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of nature to account;...&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

{{quotation
|... for over two thousand years, the ... most influential and authoritatively orthodox tradition ... has been devoted to the problem of a purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness.  ....  The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts in it, arise from a division of authority.  Scientific [instrumental] inquiry seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something quite different.  ....  As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a disclosure of [intrinsic] reality ... prior to and independent of knowing, and that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|43–4}}}}

Finding no evidence of "antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness...," Dewey argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in the continuity of human [[experience]], which always has [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s, and is always mutable.

{{quotation
|Dewey's ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal of identifying a method for improving our value judgments.  Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.  ....  This pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any ''a priori'' fixed reference point outside of conduct, such as in God's commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or "nature," considered as giving humans a fixed ''telos'' [intrinsic end].;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth|title=Dewey's Moral Philosophy|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://lplato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-moral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|114, 172–3; 197}}}}

Philosophers label a "fixed reference point outside of conduct' a "natural kind," and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced.  Natural kinds are "mind-independent" and "theory-independent" valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Tobin|first2=Emma|title=Natural Kinds|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/natural-kinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey granted the existence of "reality" apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as natural kinds possessing intrinsic qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|122, 196}}  Instead, he saw reality as functional continuity--ways of acting--not structural continuity of intrinsic interacting entities.  Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind-independent reality.  Reports or maps of any sort are never equivalent to that which is mapped.  They are fragmentary perceptions of unceasing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Tom|title=Dewey's New Logic|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1994|pages=54=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it.  They discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences successfully.  Once an end is reached - a [[problem solving|problem solved]] - reasoning turns to what comes next in new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations and actions which ignore conditions that determine consequences cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems.  They are [[irrational]].

{{quotation
|Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued.  The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.    ....  So viewed, value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;}}

In brief, Dewey rejected the traditional belief that judging things good-in-themselves, apart from existing means-end relations, can be rational.  The sole rational criterion is instrumental value.  Each successful valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental solutions of problems.   Cumulative instrumental success provides a legitimate moral compass.  Competent instrumental valuations treat the "function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations...";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: the Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|date=1938|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==J. Fagg Foster==
[[John Fagg Foster]] refined John Dewey's rejection of intrinsic value and description of instrumental value.  He clarified differences between Dewey's instrumental criterion and the widely endorsed but faulty utilitarian alternative that turns utility into an intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Edythe|title=John Fagg Foster|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=256–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since [[Aristotle]], scholars have reasoned that individual wants are intrinsic traits of human nature, the satisfaction of which is a legitimate end.  This belief is embodied in the criterion of utility, which holds that individuals--and groups of individuals in societies--legitimately try to maximize the sum of their want satisfactions.;&lt;ref name="Tool"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=Value Theory and Economic Progress: The Institutional Economics of J. Fagg Foster|publisher=Kluwer Academic|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|date=2007|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utilitarians]] hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified.  They are intrinsically worthy mental valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally.  This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts--"what is"--can serve as instrumental means for achieving wants, but cannot authorize ends--"what ought to be."  This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the is-ought problem: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves, while efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  In modern North American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the [[Libertarian]] assertion that every individual's intrinsic right to satisfy  wants makes it illegitimate for anyone--but especially governments--to tell people what they ought to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|title=Anarchy, State and Utopia|publisher=Basic Books|date=1974|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster found this "is-ought" problem a useful place to attack the irrational separation of means from ends.  He started his analysis by arguing that want-satisfaction--"what ought to be"--cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because wants are themselves consequences of transient conditions.

{{quotation
|[T]he things people want are a function of their social experience, and that is carried on through structural institutions that specify their activities and attitudes.  Thus the pattern of people's wants takes visible form partly as a result of the pattern of the institutional structure through which they participate in the economic process.  As we have seen, to say that an economic problem exists is to say that part of the particular patterns of human relationships has ceased or failed to provide the effective participation of its members.  In so saying, we are necessarily in the position of asserting that the instrumental efficiency of the economic process is the criterion of judgment in terms of which, and only in terms of which, we may resolve economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|title=The Relation Between the Theory of Value and Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1981|pages=904–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Since wants are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally.  Wants arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  Foster supported with homely examples his thesis that problematic situations--"what is"--contain the means for judging rationally factual ends: "what ought to be."

Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient than crawling--an instrumental valuation of a desirable end.  They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal.  When they master this new way of acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Confronting Foster's Wildest Claim: Only the Instrumental Theory of Value Can Be applied"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=2008|pages=537–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the global problem of unemployment.  Since the industrial revolution began, large groups of people have been deprived of traditional means of participation in two social functions--productive activity and income security--and of the dignity maintained by that participation.  Conditions that exclude participation--"what is"--must be replaced by new patterns of inclusion--"what ought to be."

At the end of World War II, the United States faced the threat of massive unemployment caused by demobilization.  Labor markets--the traditional utilitarian solution to unemployment--appeared unlikely to avoid that threat.  The instrumental solution was to prescribe a new pattern of correlated behavior to maintain participation: the [[G.I. Bill]], which generously subsidized education and livelihood for veterans and fostered a massive burst of innovation and economic expansion.  The instrumental moral compass of participation worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Planning Education for Economic Progress: Distinguishing Occupational Demands from Technological Possibilities"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1986|pages=1053–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|title=Diminished Democracy|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic value as either rule or reality was ignored.

Foster labeled successful applications of instrumental value "instrumental efficiency."  But he realized that efficiency by itself can contaminate reasoning by turning a dynamic process--"what ought to be"--into a static valuation--"what is."  Turning a conditionally-successful tool-use into a static self-justifying pattern of behavior is self-defeating.

To guard against this contamination of instrumental value, Foster revised his definition of its content to embrace both means and ends. INSTRUMENTAL VALUE: The criterion of judgment that seeks instrumentally-efficient means that "work" to achieve developmentally-continuous ends.  This definition stresses the condition that a successful operation must not lead down a dead-end street.  The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability--a synonym for instrumental value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|year=1981|title=Syllabus for Problems of Modern Society: The Theory of Institutional Adjustment|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|pages=929–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's and Foster's arguments that instrumental value is the proper criterion for judging both means and ends continue to be ignored rather than refuted.  Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing intrinsic value--"what ought to be"--independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action.  Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of popular arguments for the reality of intrinsic value as moral compass and as constraint on relativistic instrumental value.

==Jacques Ellul==
[[Jacques Ellul]] made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that Dewey and Foster found to be the core of human rationality.  And he specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey's and Foster's thesis: evolving instrumental technology.

His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title ''La technique.''  It addressed the problem Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones.  Both men agreed that conditionally efficient valuations--"what is"--become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves--"what ought to be."  But while Dewey argued that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concluded that technology had become intrinsically destructive.  The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations:

{{quotation
|Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the supernatural.  The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere.  But man cannot live without the [intrinsic] sacred.  He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to technique itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Society|publisher=Knopf|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}}}

''La technique'' was published in English in 1964 with the title ''The Technological Society'', and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences.  The translator of ''Technological Society'' summarized Ellul's thesis:

{{quotation
|''Technological Society'' is a description of the way in which an autonomous [instrumental] technology is in process of taking over the traditional values [intrinsic valuations] of every society without exception, subverting and suppressing those values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all non-technological difference and variety is mere appearance.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|v-vi, x}}}}

Ellul opened ''The Technological Society'' by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion.  It has become autonomous and absolute.

{{quotation
|The term ''technique'', as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end.  In our technological society, technique is the ''totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency'' (for a given stage of development) in ''every'' field of human activity.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|xxxvi}}}}

He accused instrumental judgment of destroying intrinsic meanings of human life.  "Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature.  Life in such an environment has no meaning.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}  Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations "disenchantment;" Ellul came to label it "terrorism."&lt;ref name="Ell 90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Bluff|publisher=William B. Erdmans|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|384, 19}}  He dated its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry.

{{quotation
|When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|73}}}}

{{quotation
|Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at all.  ....  [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all other questions that they have to ask and handle.  But technique cannot deal with such things.  ....  Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning and values [valuations].  ....  Technique is not at all concerned about the meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic valuations].&lt;ref name="Ell 90"/&gt;{{rp|147–8}}}}

Ellul's core accusation was that instrumental efficiency had become absolute--a good-in-itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  It wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics:

{{quotation
|a) It is artificial; b) it is autonomous with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state; c) It is ... self-determinative independently of all human intervention; d) It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to ends; e) It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends; f) All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22}}}}

Tiles and Oberdiek found Ellul's characterization of instrumental efficiency inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22–31}}  They criticized him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value.  They countered by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons.  Those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology with conscience and responsibility, with no need for intrinsic rules.  Tiles's and Oberdiek's conclusion coincided with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self-correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass.

{{quotation
|For although we have defended general principles of the moral responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules.  It would be foolish because concrete cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility can be fully captured by a code.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|193}}}}

{{quotation
|In fact, as we have seen in many instances, technology simply allows us to go on doing stupid things in clever ways.  The questions that technology cannot solve, although it will always frame and condition the answers, are "What should we be trying to do? What kind of lives should we, as human beings, be seeking to live?  And can this kind of life be pursued without exploiting others?   But until we can at least propose [instrumental] answers to those questions we cannot really begin to do sensible things in the clever ways that technology might permit.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

==Anjan Chakravartty&lt;!--'Semi-realism' and 'Semirealism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|Selective realism}}
[[Anjan Chakravartty]] came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value.  He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled "[[scientific realism]]," with which he identifies.  In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed.  He linked the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including [[logical positivism]] and [[instrumentalism]]

Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti-realist valuations of theories.  Anti-realists believe "that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports."  They assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality "in itself."  By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can "correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Chak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakravartty|first=Anjan|title=A Metaphysics for Scientific Realism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi, 10}}  Well-confirmed theories--"what ought to be" as the end of reasoning--are more than tools.  They are mappings of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory--"what is" as natural but metaphysical real kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|xiii, 33, 149}}

Chakravartty treated value-in-general as ungrounded opinion,&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|25}} but admitted that realists value how well theories "work"--the instrumental criterion.  He qualified that criterion's scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is inductive, heuristic, accidental.  Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses "detection properties" of natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|231}}  This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value.

He committed modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth.  Competent realists affirm that natural kinds 1) exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 2) meaningful and 3) mappable intrinsic properties.

{{quotation
|Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind-independent world or reality.  A realist semantics implies that the theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and should be construed literally ...  Finally, the epistemological commitment is to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world.  That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are (approximately) true.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|9}}}}

He labeled these intrinsic valuations semirealist, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds.  He found these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist descriptions discredited by advancing instrumental valuations.

Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul.  But Chakravartty defended natural intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science--belief in unobservable continuities.  He advanced the thesis of '''semirealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success.  Their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality.

{{quotation
|Scientific theories describe causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars such as objects, events, and processes.  Semirealism maintains that under certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things underlying them.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism.  Their [intrinsic] relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject matters of a tenable scientific realism.  They regularly cohere to form interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated by the sciences and described by scientific theories.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|119}}}}

Chakravartty argued that these semirealist valuations authorize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds, as scientists search for natural kinds.  The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality.

{{quotation
|The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive generalizations and prediction.  So the story goes, one's recognition of natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an excellent explanation for their success.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|The moral here is that however realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of those properties.  That is the bedrock of realism.  Property instances lend themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|81}}}}

In sum, Chakravartty argued that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations.  Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of  intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value.

{{quotation
|Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of a specific object or process.  ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction.  The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|191}}}}

Realist intrinsic value, such as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Weber and Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world.  Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3885">[[Image:La justice de Trajan.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Justice of Trajan'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1840.]] 
The '''Justice of Trajan''' is a legendary episode in the life of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], based upon [[Dio Cassius]]' account (Epitome of Book LXVIII, chapter 10): "He did not, however, as might have been expected of a warlike man, pay any less attention to the civil administration nor did he dispense justice any the less; on the contrary, he conducted trials, now in the Forum of Augustus, now in the Portico of Livia, as it was called, and often elsewhere on a tribunal."

According to the story, Trajan, busy with preparations for the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], was petitioned for justice by the mother of a murdered man. He asked her to wait until he returned, but she pointed out that he might not return at all. He made time to settle her case despite all the other calls on his time. The legend, though indirectly, was popularized by [[Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', alluded to in the Paradise, and recounted in Purgatory, X, 73-94:

{{cquote|The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:&lt;br&gt;
"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart&lt;br&gt;
My son is murder'd." He replying seem'd;&lt;br&gt;
"Wait now till I return." And she, as one&lt;br&gt;
Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou&lt;br&gt;
Dost not return?"—"Where I am, who then is,&lt;br&gt;
May right thee."—"What to thee is other's good,&lt;br&gt;
If thou neglect thy own?"—"Now comfort thee,"&lt;br&gt;
At length he answers. "It beseemeth well&lt;br&gt;
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:&lt;br&gt;
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.}}

The origin of the legend and its vicissitudes since antiquity have been the subject of several studies, including the detailed "Leggende" by G. Boni, published in 1906. The episode was reflected in several works of art and in the verse ''The Justice'' by Belarusian poet [[Simeon of Polotsk]] (1629—1680). Among artists that depicted the legend are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hans Sebald Beham]], [[Noël Coypel]] and [[Noël Hallé]]. A French painter [[Raoul Dufy]] was inspired by Delacroix's painting of the justice.

Historically, ''the justice of Trajan'' may also refer either to what was described by [[Pliny the Younger]] (''Epistulae'', VI, 31, a court trial in [[Centumcellae]]) or depicted on [[Trajan's Column]], where Trajan judges the captured barbarian chiefs, or to a lost painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. (The city of Brussels commissioned Van der Weyden to paint four large panel paintings for the [[Brussels Town Hall]] illustrating the 'Justice of Trajan' and the '[[Justice of Herkenbald]]'; they were destroyed when the [[Bombardment of Brussels|French bombarded the city in 1695]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dirk de Vos, 1999, ''Rogier van der Weyden'', pp. 345-355&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="987">'''Kari''', in [[shakuhachi]] music, is both a property of a note and a technique.  To play a note kari means to play it with raised [[pitch (music)|pitch]], relative to playing the note [[Meri (note)|meri]].  In addition to sharpening the pitch, playing a note kari also modifies the tone color or [[timbre]] of a note.

The usual technique to play a note kari is to raise the chin, increasing the angle and distance between the [[embouchure]] and [[utaguchi]] (blowing edge).

{{technical|date=June 2012}}
In [[petroleum engineering]], the '''Leverett ''J''-function''' is a dimensionless function of [[water saturation]] describing the [[capillary pressure]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=M.C. Leverett|title=Capillary behaviour in porous solids|journal=Transactions of the AIME|issue=142|pages=159–172|year=1941}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;J(S_w) = \frac{p_c(S_w) \sqrt{k/\phi}}{\gamma \cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the water saturation measured as a fraction, &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[capillary pressure]] (in [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]), &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] (measured in [[Square metre|m²]]), &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[porosity]] (0-1), &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] (in N/m) and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[contact angle]].  The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds.

The Leverett ''J''-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii.

This function is also widely used in modeling two-phase flow of [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell|proton-exchange membrane fuel cells]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. LaManna, J. V. Bothe Jr., F. Y. Zhang, and M. M. Mench, ''[[J. Power Sources]]'' '''271''', 180 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A large degree of hydration is needed for good proton conductivity while large liquid water saturation in pores of catalyst layer or diffusion media will impede gas transport in the cathode.

| Its significance for the biblical version of Israel's past, particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a "king of Israel" and a "[[Davidic line|house of David]]". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. Although the meaning of this phrase has  been disputed by the  minority of scholars,{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}} today it is generally accepted as a reference to [[Davidic dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L.

"The Tel Dan inscription generated a good deal of debate and a flurry of articles when it first appeared, but it is now widely regarded (a) as genuine and (b) as referring to the Davidic dynasty and the Aramaic kingdom of Damascus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, after much further discussion in academic journals, it is accepted by most archaeologists that the inscription is not only genuine but that the reference is indeed to the House of David, thus representing the first allusion found anywhere outside the Bible to the biblical David.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mykytiuk, Lawrence J.

* [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] is seen to possess strong similarities to [[Psalm 104]], which may be based on it.
* [[Admonitions of Ipuwer|Ipuwer Papyrus]] (probably 18th century BCE) – poem describing Egypt as afflicted by natural disasters and in a state of chaos. The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most histories of ancient Israel no longer consider it relevant to the story of Israel's emergence.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5-6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Nevertheless, Ipuwer is often put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "the river is blood" and its frequent references to servants running away. This ignores the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and the likelihood that the "river is blood" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}}

However, Israelite and Judaean History, Old Testament Library. Edited by John H. Hayes and J. Maxwell Miller. London: SCM Press, 1977 says, "Recently, Na'aman [Nadav Na'aman. "Sennacherib's 'Letter to God' on His Campaign to Judah," BASOR CCXIV (1974) 25–39] has shown conclusively that the fragment presumably mentioning Azriau king of Yaudi actually belongs to the time of Sennacherib and refers not to Azariah but to Hezekiah. In Tiglath-Pileser's annals there are two references to an Azariah (in line 123 as Az-ri-a-[u] and in line 131 as Az-r-ja-a-í) but neither of these make any reference to his country. Thus the Azriau of Tiglath-pileser's annals and Azariah of the Bible should be regarded as two different individuals. Azriau's country cannot, at the present, be determined." Na'aman separates the country (Yaudi) from the name Azriau (p. 36). Also p. 28 on line 5 where the original transcription was "[I]zri-ja-u mat Ja-u-di" he reads "ina birit misrija u mat Jaudi". However, Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament (OROT), p. 18, is less dogmatic. He says "Hence we cannot certainly assert that this Azriau (without a named territory!) is Azariah of Judah; the matter remains open and undecided for the present and probably unlikely." See Also CAH, 3:35–36."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5D5GNju1-ggC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''In Search of "Ancient Israel": A Study in Biblical Origins''] Philip R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3840">In [[engineering]], a '''longeron''' is a load-bearing component of a framework.  The term is commonly used in connection with [[aircraft fuselage]]s and [[automobile]] [[chassis]].  Longerons are used in conjunction with '''stringers''' to form structural frameworks.&lt;ref name=longeron&gt;{{cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Longerons|title=Longeron|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stearman stringer small.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a Boeing/Stearman PT-17 showing small channel section stringers.]]

== Aircraft ==

In aircraft fuselage, stringers are attached to [[former]]s (also called frames)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=V|first=Vignesh|title=Reconnaisance aircraft design project|url=https://www.academia.edu/35242413/Reconnaisance_aircraft_design_project|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and run in the longitudinal direction of the aircraft. They are primarily responsible for transferring the aerodynamic loads acting on the skin onto the frames and formers.  In the wings or horizontal stabilizer, longerons run spanwise (from wing root to wing tip) and attach between the [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]]. The primary function here also is to transfer the bending loads acting on the wings onto the ribs and spar.

Sometimes the terms "longeron" and "stringer" are used interchangeably. Historically, though, there is a subtle difference between the two terms. If the longitudinal members in a fuselage are few in number and run all along the fuselage length (usually 4 to 8), then they are called "longerons". The longeron system also requires that the fuselage frames be closely spaced (about every {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}}). If the longitudinal members are numerous (usually 50 to 100) and are placed just between two formers/frames, then they are called "stringers". In the stringer system the longitudinal members are smaller and the frames are spaced farther apart (about {{convert|15|to|20|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Generally, longerons are of larger cross-section when compared to stringers. On large modern aircraft the stringer system is more common because it is more weight-efficient, despite being more complex to construct and analyze. Some aircraft use a combination of both stringers and longerons.&lt;ref&gt;Bruhn, E.F., page C11.29, "Analysis and Design of Flight Vehicle Structures", 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Longerons often carry larger loads than stringers and also help to transfer skin loads to internal structure. Longerons nearly always attach to frames or [[rib (aircraft)|ribs]]. Stringers often are not attached to anything but the [[stressed skin|skin]], where they carry a portion of the fuselage bending moment through axial loading.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Y. Niu (1988). ''Airframe Structural Design''. Conmilit Press LTD. pp. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not uncommon to have a mixture of longerons and stringers in the same major structural component.

== Space launch vehicles ==

Stringers are also used in the construction of some [[launch vehicle]] [[propellant]] tanks.  For example, the [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Falcon 9]]&lt;!-- the sxFpug20151021 source is specific to the newer (late 2015 and after) version of the Falcon 9 vehicle; I would imagine, but don't have a source, that earlier F9s did the same and used stringers as well. --&gt; launch vehicle uses stringers in the [[RP-1|Kerosene (RP-1)]] tanks, but not in the [[Liquid Oxygen]] tanks, on both the first and second stages.&lt;ref name=sxf9pug20151021&gt;
{{cite web |title=Falcon 9 Launch Vehicle Payload User's Guide, Rev 2 |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/falcon_9_users_guide_rev_2.0.pdf |accessdate=29 January 2016 |date=21 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michigan Molecular Institute''' (MMI) ceased operations in 2015 after nearly 45 years of outstanding service in pursuit of applied research in polymer science and technology. 

== History ==
MMI officially opened its doors under the name Midland Macromolecular Institute in the fall of 1972, although the facility had been in operation for the previous year. The building had broken ground in the spring of 1970, and it, like many of Midland's buildings from that era, was designed by local architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The institute hosted a three-day dedication beginning September 28, 1972 with opening ceremonies that featured more than 400 scientists from throughout the world, chamber music from the Cleveland Quartet, several presentations and public tours.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The featured speakers for the ceremonies were Dr. [[Herman Francis Mark]], considered by many to be the father of macromolecular sciences, and Dr. [[Paul J. Flory]], who two years later would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Two other speakers were prof. dr. Donald Lyman and prof. dr. [[Edgar Andrews]]. Other luminaries on hand included Dr. [[Melvin Calvin]], the 1961 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry; Dr. [[Charles Overberger]], then the vice-president for research at the University of Michigan; and [[Herbert D. "Ted" Doan]], president of the Michigan Foundation for Advanced Research, which was MMI's primary financial backer in its early days. 

MMI's first director was Dr. H.G. Elias, who came to Midland from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich. Beyond funding from MFAR, early financial supporters of MMI were the Herbert H. &amp; Grace A. Dow Foundation, The Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation and the Charles J. Strosacker Foundation. In the institute's early days, Elias said MMI would be run much like a university department, although its founders expected MMI would advance macromolecular science knowledge in a way that universities could not.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; One similarity: MMI opened its doors as a not-for-profit organization, which it remains today.

MMI's first 15 years of research of advanced composite materials and polymer technology contributed to Michigan's ability to entice plastics- and composite-related industries to build in the state, and its affiliation with Central Michigan University and Michigan Technological University allowed it to offer master's and doctorate degrees in related research fields.&lt;ref&gt;"Our View", The Midland Daily News, 1990-06-03. Retrieved 2009-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, MMI began to shift its focus toward creating technology that could be licensed for commercialization. 

Over the years, six men have led the institute as President and/or CEO, including Elias (1972–83); Dr. Robert E. Hefner (1985-85 and 1990–92); Dr. John Hoffman (1985–1990); Dr. James D. Allen (1992–1994); Dr. Robert M. Nowak (1994–2009); and Dr. James H. Plonka (2009–2015).

|}MMI's emphasis from the beginning on the education portion of its mission led to a steady stream of outside experts through the institute, including the visiting professor program, established in 1973 and renamed in 1981 as a living memorial to the late Dr. Turner Alfrey, Jr. Each year, a leading scientist is invited to teach a short course, visit sponsoring organizations and deliver additional research seminars, benefitting many people by providing a point of connection between local scientists and engineers with the world leaders of the polymer science field.&lt;ref&gt;"Carnegie Mellon professor to lecture at MMI in May", The Midland Daily News, 2004-04-18. Retrieved 2010-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TAVP speakers from around the world have been invited to present the latest, most up-to-date information in their particular polymer expertise areas.  Typically, these courses were delivered in an intensive, one-week, daily lecture format. Visiting professors also spent additional time at MMI, participating in one-on-one and research group discussions at the Institute, and in collaborations and discussions with other nearby industrial and academic researchers.  They also prepared and delivered a set of on-site seminars for many of the sponsoring organizations that parallel and supplement the formal course lectures.  Financial co-sponsors of the Turner Alfrey Visiting Professor program included [[The Dow Chemical Company]], [[Dow Corning Corporation]], [[Michigan State University]], [[Central Michigan University]], [[Saginaw Valley State University]], the Mid-Michigan Section of the [[Society of Plastics Engineers]], and the Midland Section of the [[American Chemical Society]].

The list of Turner Alfrey Visiting Professors includes several [[Nobel Prize]] winners.

[[File:Audio n-1.png|thumb|250px|Example of a mix-minus (notated as ''n-1'') from a studio to a satellite linked remote unit.]]
Relative to [[audio engineering]], a '''mix-minus''' or '''clean feed''' is a particular setup of a [[mixing console]] or [[matrix mixer]], such that each output of the mixer contains everything ''except'' the associated input.  Mix-minus, which is technically accomplished via a wiring and patching configuration, is often used to prevent [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] or [[Audio feedback|feedback]] in [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or [[sound reinforcement]] systems.

==Examples of mix-minus configurations==
The most common situation in which a mix-minus is used is when a [[telephone hybrid]] is connected to a console, usually at a [[radio station]].  The person on the [[telephone]] hears all relevant feeds, usually an identical mix to that of the master bus, including the [[DJ]]'s mic feed, except that the caller does not hear his own voice. Because the feed being returned to the telephone has an identical mix, minus only one input, it is most efficient to employ a mix-minus as opposed to creating and mixing for a new independent output bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomagonline.com/products/0002/what-is-mixminus/29788|title=What is mix-minus?|publisher=Radio magazine|first=Chriss|last=Scherer|date=2008-12-09|accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mix-minus is also often used together with [[Interruptible_fold_back|IFB]] systems in [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) for [[television news]] reporters and interview subjects speaking to a host from a remote [[outside broadcast]] (OB) location.  Because of the delay that is introduced in most means of transmission (including [[Communications satellite|satellite]] feeds and [[audio over IP]] connections), the remote subject's voice has to be removed from his [[earpiece]].  Otherwise, the subject would hear himself with a slight (but very distracting) delay. 

Another common example is in the field of sound reinforcement.  Consider a room with sound stations for multiple users, each station containing a microphone and a loudspeaker.  Such a room might be used in a government house of parliament.  The microphone in station #1 would feed the loudspeakers in every other station except station #1.  In other words, station #1 receives a mix of all microphones minus the station #1 microphone.  This enables all participants to hear each other clearly but minimizes problems with [[audio feedback|acoustic feedback]].

Mix-minus is also used with [[VoIP]] communication when recording for [[podcast|podcasts]]:  mix-minus removes the caller's voice from the VoIP call, but allows them to hear all other channels available at the mixing console (mixer).

Some broadcast mixing desks, notably those designed in house by the [[BBC]], maintain a separate mix bus for ''clean feeds''. This approach is technically different, and arguably more flexible than most implementations of mix-minus, but the end result is the same.

Sign Language communication is a system of communication using visual gestures and signs, as used by deaf people. A unique property of [[Sign Language]] is that it is not easy to put on paper due to a lack of formal acceptance, &lt;ref name="written-forms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language#Written_forms|title=Written Sign Language forms on Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is impossible to be mediated over the phone or in a plain email. Because of its three-dimensional nature, it can only be transferred in the form of timed two or three dimensional snapshots, also known as a video. The video itself has to be large and fast enough to capture sign language movements sufficiently.

In the late 1990s, it became possible for deaf people to use electronic communication tools as another channel for [[Sign Language]]. Initially, there weren't many choices prior to the advent of more interfaces (e.g. APIs like {{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dom-navigator-getusermedias|title=getUserMedia}}). With these, however, deaf people can perform electronic sign language exchanges independently without the need for a third person in the middle, i.e. a [[Video relay service]].

The '''northern hardwood forest''' is a general type of [[North America]]n forest ecosystem found over much of southeastern and south central [[Canada]], Ontario and Quebec, extending south into the [[United States]] in northern [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]], and west along the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Minnesota]] and western [[Ontario]]. Some ecologists consider it a [[transitional forest]] because it contains species common to both the [[oak-hickory forest]] community to the south and the [[Boreal forest]] community to the north. The trees and shrub species of the Northern Hardwood Forest are known for their brilliant fall colors, making the regions that contain this forest type popular [[fall foliage]] tourist destinations. 

[[Sugar maple]], [[yellow birch]], [[American beech]], and [[Fraxinus americana|White Ash]] are the common key indicator tree and shrub species in the Northern Hardwood Forest. Other species include [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]] and [[eastern white pine]]. Herb and heath species include [[wintergreen]], [[wild sarsaparilla]], and [[wood sorrel]]. Birds and animals common to the Northern Hardwood Forest include the [[black-capped chickadee]], [[white-throated sparrow]], [[cedar waxwing]], [[porcupine]], [[snowshoe hare]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[American Red Squirrel]]. 

Most of the Northern Hardwood Forest is not [[virgin forest]], it is regrowth following centuries of commercial timber harvesting and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes. This is particularly true of New England, New York, and Eastern Canada, where the land was cleared to make room for farms in the 17th and 18th centuries and subsequently abandoned in the 19th century when farming interests migrated to the midwestern United States and central Canada. 

The Northern Hardwood Forest is indigenous to several well-known parks and national forests, including the [[Boundary Waters]] region of Minnesota, New York's [[Adirondack Park]], the [[White Mountain National Forest]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountain National Forest]] in Vermont, [[Baxter State Park]] and [[Acadia National Park]] in Maine, and [[Fundy National Park]] in [[New Brunswick]]. The [[Berkshires]] region of western [[Massachusetts]] is very typical of a Northern Hardwood Forest ecosystem.  Northern hardwood stands are also found in the higher elevations of the southern [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], typically between {{convert|4500|ft|m}} and {{convert|5500|ft|m}}, where climatic conditions resemble those in northern states and southern Canada.

'''Object literacy''' is a relatively new term that has grown out of Object Based Learning (OBL), which has long been a fundamental part of museum and library work. The increasing availability of digital images and texts makes objects more accessible than ever. Now that the objects and texts are more available, there is an increasing interest in the physicality of the object or text, and a growing understanding of the need to understand objects and texts  in the fullest, most comprehensive context.

== Definitions of Object Literacy ==
* "Object literacy is a special skill gained through the process of discovery and discussion about original objects. It is a skill which, like others, must be learned. Museums have original objects, artifacts, or works of art. Therefore, museums are logical places in which to teach people to become object literate." - Sally Leahy (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Sally Leahy, “Object Literacy,” The Docent Educator 4.3 (Spring 1995): 17. http://www.museum-ed.org/object-literacy/ - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy is also seen as "a subset of [[visual literacy]], leading to a new brand of museum literacy." - Carin Jacobs (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Carin Jacobs, "Beyond the field trip: museum literacy and higher education", ''Museum Management and Curatorship'', Vol. 24, No. 1, March 2009, 5�27 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09647770902731585 - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy recognises "the current trend for printed material and text as a visual medium” in which people “study ways in which the physical aspects of rare books [and other objects] contribute to the understanding the text”.&lt;ref&gt;Tabitha Tuckett and Elizabeth Lawes, "Object literacy at University College London Library Services", ''Art Libraries Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 2 (Information Literacy in UK and US Art Libraries), April 2017 , pp. 99-106.   https://doi.org/10.1017/alj.2017.13 - Retrieved 25 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]].&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = For the purposes of this book we decided to take a conservative approach, and to focus on the relationship between pitch and musical melodies.  Following the earlier ASA definition, we define pitch as 'that attribute of sensation whose variation is associated with musical melodies.' Although some might find this too restrictive, an advantage of this definition is that it provides a clear procedure for testing whether or not a stimulus evokes a pitch, and a clear limitation on the range of stimuli that we need to consider in our discussions.

Pitch can be determined only in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from [[noise]].&lt;ref&gt;Harold S.

"Melody: In the most general case, a coherent succession of pitches.  Here pitch means a stretch of sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to be heard as not noise; succession means that several pitches occur; and coherent means that the succession of pitches is accepted as belonging together" (p. 499).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pitch is a major [[auditory system|auditory]] attribute of [[musical tone]]s, along with [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], and [[timbre]].&lt;ref&gt;

Pitch may be quantified as a [[frequency]], but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustical]] attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.&lt;ref name=hartmann&gt;{{Cite book| title = Signals, Sound, and Sensation | last= Hartmann |first= William Morris| publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56396-283-7 | pages = 145, 284, 287 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=William+M.+Hartmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of pitch==

===Pitch and frequency===
Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns [[musical tone]]s to relative positions on a [[musical scale]] based primarily on their perception of the [[frequency]] of vibration.&lt;ref name=plack&gt;
{{Cite book
 | title = Pitch: Neural Coding and Perception

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's ''subjective perception'' of a sound wave, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.

The [[oscillations]] of sound waves can often be characterized in terms of ''frequency''. ''Pitches'' are usually &lt;u&gt;associated with&lt;/u&gt;, and thus &lt;u&gt;quantified as&lt;/u&gt;, ''frequencies'' (in cycles per second, or hertz), by comparing the sounds being assessed against sounds with [[pure tone]]s (ones with [[Period (physics)|periodic]], [[sinusoidal]] waveforms). Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a ''pitch'' by this method.&lt;ref&gt;

According to the [[American National Standards Institute]], pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or [[amplitude]], of the wave. That is, "high" pitch means very rapid oscillation, and "low" pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the [[idiom]] relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"/&gt; At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or reduced.&lt;ref name="pratt1930"&gt;Carroll C. Pratt, "[http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/pratt30.htm The Spatial Character of High and Low Tones]", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' 13 (1930): 278–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the pitch of complex sounds such as [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[musical note]]s corresponds very nearly to the repetition rate of periodic or nearly-periodic sounds, or to the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the time interval between repeating similar events in the sound waveform.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=lyon/&gt;

The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer.&lt;ref name=hartmann/&gt; When the actual [[fundamental frequency]] can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of [[overtones]], also known as upper partials, [[harmonic]] or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the [[combination tone]] at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. In a situation like this, the percept at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz is commonly referred to as the [[missing fundamental]], which is often the [[greatest common divisor]] of the frequencies present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=David A.|author2=Dale Purves|title=Pitch Is Determined by Naturally Occurring Periodic Sounds|journal=Hearing Research|date=May 2004|volume=194|issue=1–2|pages=31–46|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2004.01.019|pmid=15276674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitch depends to a lesser degree on the [[sound pressure]] level (loudness, volume) of the tone, especially at frequencies below 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The pitch of lower tones gets lower as sound pressure increases. For instance, a tone of 200&amp;nbsp;Hz that is very loud seems one semitone lower in pitch than if it is just barely audible. Above 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the pitch gets higher as the sound gets louder.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; These results were obtained in the pioneering works by S.Stevens &lt;ref name=stevens1935&gt;Stevens S. S. The relation of pitch to intensity//J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 1935. Vol. 6. P. 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and W.Snow &lt;ref name=snow&gt; Snow W. B. (1936) Change of Pitch with Loudness at Low Frequencies. J. Acoust. Soc. Am/ 8:14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;. Later investigations, i.e. by A.Cohen, had shown that in most cases the apparent pitch shifts were not significantly different from pitch‐matching errors. When averaged, the remaining shifts followed the directions of Stevens' curves but were small (2% or less by frequency, i.e. not more than a semitone)&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, A. (1961). Further investigation of the effects of intensity upon the pitch of pure tones. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 33, 1363-1376. https://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.1908441&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of pitch perception===

[[Scientific theory|Theories]] of pitch perception try to explain how the physical sound and specific physiology of the auditory system work together to yield the experience of pitch. In general, pitch perception theories can be divided into [[Place theory (hearing)|place coding]] and [[Temporal theory (hearing)|temporal coding]]. Place theory holds that the perception of pitch is determined by the place of maximum excitation on the [[basilar membrane]].

A place code, taking advantage of the [[tonotopy]] in the auditory system, must be in effect for the perception of high frequencies, since neurons have an upper limit on how fast they can phase-lock their [[action potential]]s.&lt;ref name=plack /&gt; However, a purely place-based theory cannot account for the accuracy of pitch perception in the low and middle frequency ranges.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the [[Circle map|phase-locking]] and [[Arnold tongue#Mode locking|mode-locking]] of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus.

===Just-noticeable difference===

The ''[[just-noticeable difference|just-noticeable difference (jnd)]]'' (the [[Sensory threshold|threshold]] at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone's frequency content.  Below 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd is about 3&amp;nbsp;Hz for sine waves, and 1&amp;nbsp;Hz for complex tones; above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the jnd for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 [[Cent (music)|cents]]).&lt;ref&gt;

The '''jnd''' is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

===Aural illusions===

The relative perception of pitch can be fooled, resulting in ''[[aural illusion]]s''. There are several of these, such as the [[tritone paradox]], but most notably the [[Shepard scale]], where a continuous or discrete sequence of specially formed tones can be made to sound as if the sequence continues ascending or descending forever.

==Definite and indefinite pitch== &lt;!--[[Definite pitch]], "Indefinite pitch", and "Indeterminate pitch" all redirect to this section heading--&gt;

Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch. The [[unpitched percussion instrument]] (a class of [[percussion instrument]]) does not produce particular pitches. A sound or note of '''definite pitch''' is one where a listener can possibly (or relatively easily) discern the pitch. Sounds with definite pitch have [[harmonic]] [[frequency spectrum|frequency spectra]] or close to harmonic spectra.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously. A listener hears numerous frequencies at once. The vibration with the lowest frequency is called the ''[[fundamental frequency]]''; the other frequencies are ''[[overtones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | quote = "The one with the slowest vibration rate—the one lowest in pitch—is referred to as the fundamental frequency, and the others are collectively called overtones."}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Harmonics]]'' are an important class of overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples, they are collectively called the [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]], referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum.

A sound or note of '''indefinite pitch''' is one that a listener finds impossible or relatively difficult to identify as to pitch. Sounds with indefinite pitch do not have harmonic spectra or have altered harmonic spectra—a characteristic known as [[inharmonicity]].

It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another. For instance, a [[snare drum]] sounds higher pitched than a [[bass drum]] though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch.
A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This phenomenon is called ''[[repetition pitch]]'', because the addition of a true repetition of the original sound to itself is the basic prerequisite.

==Pitch standards and Standard pitch==

{{Main|Concert pitch}}

A pitch standard (also [[Concert pitch]]) is the conventional pitch reference a group of [[musical instrument]]s are tuned to for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over musical history.

{{listen|filename=Sine wave 440.ogg|title=440&amp;nbsp;Hz}}

Standard pitch is a more widely accepted convention. The '''A''' above [[middle C]] is usually set at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (often written as "A = [[A440 (pitch standard)|440&amp;nbsp;Hz]]" or sometimes "A440"), although other frequencies, such as 442&amp;nbsp;Hz, are also often used as variants. Another standard pitch, the so-called ''Baroque pitch'', has been set in the 20th century as A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz—approximately an equal-tempered semitone lower than A440 to facilitate transposition.

[[Transposing instruments]] have their origin in the variety of pitch standards. In modern times, they conventionally have their [[Part (music)|parts]] transposed into different [[key signatures|keys]] from voices and other instruments (and even from each other). As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.

For example, the most common type of [[clarinet]] or [[trumpet]], when playing a note written in their [[Part (music)|part]] as C, sounds a pitch that is called B{{music|flat}} on a non-transposing instrument like a violin (which indicates that at one time these wind instruments played at a standard pitch a tone lower than violin pitch). To refer to that pitch unambiguously, a musician calls it ''concert B{{music|flat}}'', meaning, "...the pitch that someone playing a non-transposing instrument like a violin calls B{{music|flat}}."

==Labeling pitches==

{{for|a comprehensive list of frequencies of musical notes|Scientific pitch notation|Frequencies of notes}}
[[File:Music frequency diatonic scale-3.svg|thumb|350px|right|Note frequencies, four-octave C major diatonic scale, starting with [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]
Pitches are labeled using:
* Letters, as in [[Helmholtz pitch notation]]&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Grove Dictionary of Music: ''[http://www.answers.com/topic/hermann-von-helmholtz Hermann von Helmholtz], Oxford University Press (1994), ''Answers.com''. Retrieved 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmholtz|first1=Hermann|title=On the Sensations of Tone (English Translation)|date=1885|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CiqYQXZjIYC&amp;pg=PA15|isbn=9781602066397}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A combination of letters and numbers—as in [[scientific pitch notation]], where notes are labelled upwards from C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz C
* Numbers that represent the frequency in [[hertz]] (Hz), the number of cycles per second
For example, one might refer to the A above middle C as ''a′'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''440&amp;nbsp;Hz''. In standard Western [[equal temperament]], the notion of pitch is insensitive to "spelling": the description "G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; double sharp" refers to the same pitch as ''A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches.
Human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to [[fundamental frequency]]: the perceived interval between the pitches "A220" and "A440" is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches ''A440'' and ''A880''.  Motivated by this logarithmic perception, music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a numerical scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency.  For example, one can adopt the widely used [[MIDI]] standard to map fundamental frequency, ''f'', to a real number, ''p'', as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
p = 69 + 12\times\log_2 { \left(\frac {f}{440 \mbox{ Hz}} \right) }
&lt;/math&gt;
This creates a linear [[pitch space]] in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69. (See [[Frequencies of notes]].) Distance in this space corresponds to musical intervals as understood by musicians. An equal-tempered semitone is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (music)|cents]]. The system is flexible enough to include "microtones" not found on standard piano keyboards. For example, the pitch halfway between C (60) and C{{music|sharp}} (61) can be labeled 60.5.

The following table shows frequencies in Hz for notes in various octaves, named according to the [[Helmholtz pitch notation#Staff representation|"German method" of octave nomenclature]]:

==Scales==

The relative pitches of individual notes in a [[scale (music)|scale]] may be determined by one of a number of [[musical tuning|tuning]] systems. In the west, the twelve-note [[chromatic scale]] is the most common method of organization, with [[equal temperament]] now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In [[well temperament|well-tempered]] systems (as used in the time of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], for example), different methods of [[musical tuning]] were used. Almost all of these systems have one [[interval (music)|interval]] in common, the [[octave]], where the pitch of one note is double the frequency of another. For example, if the A above middle C is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, the A an octave above that is {{Audio-nohelp|Tone 880Hz.ogg|880&amp;nbsp;Hz}}.

==Other musical meanings of pitch==

In [[atonal]], [[twelve tone technique|twelve tone]], or [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] a "pitch" is a specific frequency while a [[pitch class]] is all the octaves of a frequency. In many analytic discussions of atonal and post-tonal music, pitches are named with [[integer]]s because of octave and enharmonic equivalency (for example, in a serial system, C{{music|sharp}} and D{{music|flat}} are considered the same pitch, while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are functionally the same, one octave apart).

Discrete pitches, rather than continuously variable pitches, are virtually universal, with exceptions including "[[Shout-and-fall|tumbling strains]]"&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In ''The Wellsprings of Music'', edited by J. Kunst. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff. Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and "indeterminate-pitch chants".&lt;ref&gt;Malm, W.P. (1967). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Cited in Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Gliding pitches are used in most cultures, but are related to the discrete pitches they reference or embellish.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edward M. (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">'''Progressive provisioning''' is a term used in [[entomology]] to refer to a form of [[Parental investment|parental behavior]] in which an adult (most commonly a [[hymenoptera]]n such as a [[bee]] or [[wasp]]) feeds its [[larva]]e directly after they have hatched, feeding each larva repeatedly until it has completed development. The food is typically in the form of masticated or immobilized prey items (in predatory wasps), or regurgitated nectar mixed with pollen (in bees); only rarely are other sorts of food resources used (such as glandular secretions, or carrion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Field |first1=Jeremy |title=The evolution of progressive provisioning |journal=Behavioral Ecology |date=2005 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ari054 |url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=field2005pp.pdf&amp;site=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this sort of direct and repetitive feeding of offspring is extremely common in groups such as [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, it is far less common among the insects, with the exception of those groups of insects which are [[eusocial]] (one of the defining features of eusociality is cooperative brood care). Accordingly, progressive provisioning is universal among [[ant]]s, and widespread among the social bees and wasps. Young [[termite]]s (and other [[hemimetabolous]] insects) are able to feed themselves, and therefore do not demonstrate any form of provisioning.&lt;ref name="Societies"/&gt;

One of the only well-known examples of progressive provisioning outside of the Hymenoptera are the [[burying beetle]]s, which care for their larvae and supply them with a mass of carrion, which the adults chew and regurgitate to the developing larvae.&lt;ref name="Societies"/&gt;

Many eusocial bees, such as [[stingless bee]]s and [[halictidae|halictids]], practice [[mass provisioning]], where all of the larval food is supplied before the egg is laid.&lt;ref name="Societies"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=E.

In [[botany|plant biology]], [[protease inhibitor (biology)|proteinase inhibitors]] are a family of small [[protein]]s that serve an integral role in the plant’s defense mechanisms against [[Herbivore#Definition and related terms|herbivory]] from [[insect]]s or [[microorganism]]s that may compromise the integrity of the plant. Proteinase inhibitors are present in all plants and are highly concentrated in the storage tissues of the plant as well as portions of the plant that have suffered damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habib|first=Huma|last2=Fazili|first2=Khalid|date=August 2007|title=Plant protease inhibitors: a defense strategy in plants|url=https://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380100578_Habeeb%20and%20Khalid.pdf|journal=Biotechnology and Molecular Biology Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=68–85|via=Academic Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work to disrupt the enzymatic ability of the [[digestive enzyme|digestive]] or microbial [[enzymes]] that are present in the [[stomach]] of the attacker resulting in the inability to properly [[digestion|digest]] the plant material. This causes an interference of proper growth and discourages further wounding of the plant by the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Shu-Guo|last2=Wu|first2=Guo-Jiang|date=2005|title=Characteristics of plant proteinase inhibitors and their applications in combating phytophagous insects|url=https://ejournal.sinica.edu.tw/bbas/content/2005/4/Bot464-01.html|journal=Botanical Bulletin of Academia Sinica|volume=46|pages=273–292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also recently{{when|date=June 2018}} revealed that some proteinase inhibitors also provide defense for the plant through the possession of [[antimicrobial]] properties providing for the inhibition of [[pathogen]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim JY, Park SC, Hwang I, Cheong H, Nah JW, Hahm KS, Park Y | title = Protease inhibitors from plants with antimicrobial activity | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 2860–72 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19582234 | pmc = 2705521 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10062860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While proteinase inhibitors are present in plants naturally, production of these proteins for defense is often induced by either wounding of the plant or by chemical signaling through molecules such as [[methyl jasmonate]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=E.

Many other signal cascades as well as the [[Translocation (botany)|translocation]] of signal molecules through the [[phloem]] and [[xylem]] of the plant are also necessary for the production of these inhibitors. Once the proteinase inhibitor has been ingested by the insect, it presents itself as a normal [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] for the digestive enzymes binding to the active site on the enzyme. This binding of the inhibitor to the proteinase creates a new complex that is very unlikely to dissociate. Once bound, the active site can no longer be accessed by any other substrate and the enzyme can no longer digest the [[amino acid]]s of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Paulraj|last2=Koundal|first2=Kripa|date=April 15, 2002|title=Plant protease inhibitors in control of phytophagous insects|url=http://www.ejbiotechnology.info/index.php/ejbiotechnology/article/view/v5n1-3/947|journal=Plant Biotechnology|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.2225/vol5-issue1-fulltext-3|via=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper digestion, the insect is unable to grow, and may starve if it chooses to remain at the wounded plant. Similar inhibition of growth can be seen in pathogens that interact with these inhibitors.

In order to discover how the production of the inhibitors was induced, scientists exposed [[tomato]] plants to different forms of methyl jasmonate and then [[assay]]ed using [[radial immunodiffusion]] for proteinase inhibitors in leaf juices. A group of tomato plants was sprayed with a solution containing methyl jasmonate, while another group of tomato plants was exposed to methyl jasmonate vapor in air-tight glass chambers. [[Treatment and control groups|Control groups]] were sprayed with a solution or exposed to a vapor that did not contain methyl jasmonate. Both [[Treatment and control groups|experimental groups]] revealed increased proteinase inhibitor production as a result of exposure to [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] methyl jasmonate in comparison to control groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The production of proteinase inhibitors reveals that plants have the ability to alter their defense behavior in response to a threat or direct attack on plant integrity. This complex defense mechanism serves to not only protect the plant from being eaten, but also from pathogen infection requiring both coordination and communication.

The '''Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP)''' is a biomedical research center, which conducts curiosity-driven [[basic research]] in the [[molecular biology|molecular]] [[life sciences]]. 

The IMP is located at the [[Vienna Biocenter]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The institute employs around 250 people from 36 nations, of which approximately 200 are scientists.{{cn|date=February 2018}} The working language at the IMP is English. The IMP was established in 1985 and is funded by the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] and research grants.&lt;ref name="boehringer-ingelheim.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology | website=boehringer-ingelheim.com | url=https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/research-development/research-institute-molecular-pathology/research-institute-molecular-pathology | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications, awards and honours===
Scientists at the IMP publish 60 to 90 papers in international peer-review journals per year: between 1985 and 2017, more than 2,000 research papers were published. 93 patents were filed based on discoveries made at the institute since 1985. IMP faculty was awarded 16 [[European Research Council|ERC Grants]] since the establishment of this grant scheme in 2007. Four IMP faculty members received [[Wittgenstein-Preis|Wittgenstein Awards]] since 1996. About one third of the faculty are elected members of [[European Molecular Biology Organization|EMBO]].&lt;ref name="IMPHistory" /&gt; In 2017, [[Kim Nasmyth]] received the [[Breakthrough Prize]] in life sciences for work on [[cohesin]] that he had done at the IMP. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imp.ac.at/news/detail/article/breakthrough-prize-awarded-to-kim-nasmyth/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
IMP maintains a suite of in-house facilities, maintained in cooperation with IMBA, that provide support and scientific services to the scientists at IMP.&lt;ref name="CoresIMP"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to Core Facilities | website=IMP | url=http://cores.imp.ac.at/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the four research institutes of the Vienna Biocenter maintain a number of shared services jointly called "VBC Core Facilities" (VBCF). The services offered are available to all VBC scientists including IMP staff.&lt;ref name="VBCF 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=VBCF | website=VBCF | date=2018-02-01 | url=http://www.vbcf.ac.at/home/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the IMP was a joint venture by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] and [[Genentech]] and initiated in 1985. Under the directorship of [[Max Birnstiel]], the first institute building was opened in 1988.

In 1992, three institutes of the faculties of science and medicine of the [[University of Vienna]] moved into a nearby building, today's [[Max F. Perutz Laboratories]] (MFPL). This created the basis for referring to the area as the "Vienna Biocenter" (VBC).

In 1993, Boehringer Ingelheim took over the IMP shares of Genentech. Following Max Birnstiel's retirement in 1997, [[Kim Nasmyth]] became scientific director. 

In 2006, two institutes of the Austrian Academy of Sciences were opened in the vicinity of the IMP: the [[Institute of Molecular Biotechnology]] (IMBA) and the [[Gregor Mendel Institute]] (GMI). The three institutes cooperate closely by maintaining shared facilities. In the same year, [[Barry Dickson]] became the IMP's scientific director.

Since 2013, [[Jan-Michael Peters]] is scientific director of the IMP. In late 2016, the IMP moved into its new building, which was formally opened on 1 March 2017.&lt;ref name="IMPHistory"&gt;{{cite web | title=History | website=The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology | url=https://www.imp.ac.at/about/history/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PhD program==
The "VBC PhD Programme" is an international PhD training program carried out jointly by the four Vienna Biocenter research institutes (IMP, IMBA, GMI and MFPL). Acceptance into the program is competitive and based on a formal selection procedure. There are two selections each year, deadlines are April 30 and November 15. Participation in the program is a condition for doing a PhD at the IMP.&lt;ref name="VBCPhDProgramme"&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | website=Vienna Biocenter PhD Programme | url=http://www.vbcphdprogramme.at/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:IMP-outside.jpg|thumb|Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), outside view.]]
The current IMP building at Campus-Vienna-Biocenter 1 was opened in 2017. It comprises 15,000 square meters of gross floor space and 8,000 square meters of net area, spread over eight levels. 

The building contains 3,000 square meters for laboratories and 2,000 square meters for offices; its lecture hall seats up to 280 people. The buildings has six seminar rooms and technical facilities. Some facilities such as cafeteria, but also scientific services, are open to staff from other Vienna Biocenter entities and the IMP building is connected to the neighboring Institute of Molecular Biotechnology building through a bridge. 

[[File:Spit-levels.jpg|thumb|Split-level architecture blending different floors and functions of the new IMP building.]]

Several features of the building refer to biological research: the facade features stripes should resemble [[DNA]] bands as seen in [[gel electrophoresis]]; the central elevator's glass covers are coated with [[Dichroic filter|dichroic foils]] which are also used in filters for light microscopy. The project costs of 52 million Euros were born by the IMP's main sponsor Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;ref name="LISAvienna 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=IMP: New IMP Building: International Research Center Opens in Vienna | website=LISAvienna | date=2017-03-01 | url=http://lisavienna.at/en/news/imp-new-imp-building-international-research-center-opens-vienna | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Advisory Board==
In order to maintain a high standard of research, the IMP employs a process of continuous review and feedback. The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), consisting of distinguished scientists, meets once a year and discusses the quality, significance, and main focus of research conducted at the IMP. The SAB is chaired by [[Leslie Vosshall]] of [[Rockefeller University]]. Its other members are [[Angelika Amon]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]); [[Hans Clevers]] ([[Hubrecht Institute]]); [[Michael Hausser]] ([[University College London]]); Norbert Kraut (Boehringer Ingelheim); [[Dan Littman]] ([[New York University]] Langone Medical Center); [[Ruslan Medzhitov]] ([[Yale School of Medicine]]/[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute|HHMI]]); [[Tom Rapoport]] ([[Harvard Medical School]]); [[Dirk Sch&amp;uuml;beler]] ([[Friedrich Miescher Institute]]).&lt;ref name="IMPBoard"&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Advisory Board | website=The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology | url=https://www.imp.ac.at/about/advisory-board/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The operating budget of the IMP is provided largely by Boehringer Ingelheim. Support comes from grants awarded to individual scientists and projects by national and international funding agencies such as the [[Austrian Science Fund]] (FWF), Austrian Industrial Research Promotion Fund (FFG), the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF), Zentrum für Innovation und Technologie (ZIT), the City of Vienna, the Austrian federal government, the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), and the European Union (EU).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Reye syndrome''' is a rapidly progressive [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Symptoms may include [[vomiting]], personality changes, confusion, [[seizure]]s, and [[loss of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Even though [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]] typically occurs, [[jaundice]] usually does not.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sch2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrör|first1=K|title=Aspirin and Reye syndrome: a review of the evidence.|journal=Paediatric drugs|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=195–204|pmid=17523700|doi=10.2165/00148581-200709030-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Reye's Syndrome Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|website=NINDS|accessdate=August 8, 2016|date=September 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801041308/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|archive-date=August 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt; Changes on blood tests may include a [[hyperammonemia|high blood ammonia level]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar level]], and prolonged [[prothrombin time]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Often the [[hepatomegaly|liver is enlarged]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is typically by avoiding the use of aspirin in children.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was seen.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Early diagnosis improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Treatment is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be used to help with the [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, and culture --&gt;
The first detailed description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by [[Douglas Reye]], an Australian pathologist.&lt;ref name=Os2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillan|first1=Julia A.|last2=Feigin|first2=Ralph D.|last3=DeAngelis|first3=Catherine|last4=Jones|first4=M.

==Causes==
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt;

The association with aspirin has been shown through epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of "Reye Syndrome" greatly decreased in the 1980s, when genetic testing for [[inborn errors of metabolism]] was becoming available in [[developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; A retrospective study of 49 survivors of cases diagnosed as "Reye's Syndrome" showed that the majority of the surviving patients had various metabolic disorders, particularly a fatty-acid oxidation disorder [[medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orlowski JP |title=Whatever happened to Reye's syndrome? Did it ever really exist? |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1582–7 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10470768 |doi=10.1097/00003246-199908000-00032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
There is an association between taking [[aspirin]] for viral illnesses and the development of Reye syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hurwitz | first1 = E. S. | title = Reye's syndrome | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = 249–253 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2680560}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no animal model of Reye syndrome has been developed in which aspirin causes the condition.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR |title=Is aspirin a cause of Reye's syndrome? A case against |journal=Drug Safety |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=225–31 |year=2002 |pmid=11994026 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225040-00001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023203232/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The serious symptoms of Reye syndrome appear to result from damage to cellular [[mitochondria]],&lt;ref name="pmid18725066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gosalakkal JA, Kamoji V |title=Reye syndrome and reye-like syndrome |journal=Pediatric Neurology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=198–200 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18725066 |doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the liver, and there are a number of ways that aspirin could cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage. A potential increased risk of developing Reye syndrome is one of the main reasons that aspirin has not been recommended for use in children and teenagers, the age group for which the risk of lasting serious effects is highest.

In some countries, oral mouthcare product [[Bonjela]] (not the form specifically designed for teething) has labeling cautioning against its use in children, given its [[salicylate]] content. There have been no cases of Reye syndrome following its use, and the measure is a precaution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |title=New advice on oral salicylate gels in under 16s |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426205906/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other medications containing salicylates are often similarly labeled as a precaution.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the [[United States]], it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid).

Current advice in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] is that aspirin should not be given to those under the age of 16 years, unless specifically indicated in [[Kawasaki disease]] or in the prevention of blood clot formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary for Children]] |chapter=2.9 Antiplatelet drugs |year=2007 |pages=151 |publisher=British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Causes for similar symptoms include
* Various inborn [[metabolic disorders]]
* [[Viral encephalitis]]
* [[Drug overdose]] or [[poison]]ing
* [[Head trauma]]
* [[Liver failure]] due to other causes
* [[Meningitis]]
* [[Kidney failure]]
* [[Shaken baby syndrome]]

==Treatment==
Treatment is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be used to help with the [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Documented cases of Reye syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of onset.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In children, mild to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants.  Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Epidemiology==
Reye syndrome occurs almost exclusively in children.  While a few adult cases have been reported over the years, these cases do not typically show permanent neural or liver damage. Unlike in the UK, the surveillance for Reye syndrome in the US is focused on patients under 18 years of age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1980, after the CDC began cautioning physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses, the incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States began to decline. However, the decline began prior to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s issue of warning labels on aspirin in 1986.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; In the United States between 1980 and 1997, the number of reported cases of Reye syndrome decreased from 555 cases in 1980 to about 2 cases per year since 1994. During this time period 93% of reported cases for which racial data were available occurred in whites and the median age was six years. In 93% of cases a viral illness had occurred  in the preceding three-week period. For the period 1991-1994, the annual rate of hospitalizations due to Reye syndrome in the US was estimated to be between 0.2 and 1.1 per million population less than 18 years of age.

During the 1980s, a case-control study carried out in the United Kingdom also demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall SM, Plaster PA, Glasgow JF, Hancock P |title=Preadmission antipyretics in Reye's syndrome |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=857–66 |year=1988 |pmid=3415311 |doi=10.1136/adc.63.7.857 |pmc=1779086}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986, the United Kingdom [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and warning labels on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. UK surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983/84 to 0.11 in 1990/91.

From November 1995 to November 1996 in France, a national survey of pediatric departments for children under 15 years of age with unexplained [[encephalopathy]] and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia led to the identification of nine definite cases of Reye syndrome (0.79 cases per million children).  Eight of the nine children with Reye syndrome were found to have been exposed to aspirin.  In part because of this survey result, the French Medicines Agency reinforced the international attention to the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome by issuing its own public and professional warnings about this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Autret-Leca E |title=Incidence of Reye's syndrome in France: a hospital-based survey |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=857–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11470397|doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00366-8 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Jonville-Béra AP |author3=Llau ME |display-authors=3 |last4=Bavoux |first4=F |last5=Saudubray |first5=JM |last6=Laugier |first6=J |last7=Devictor |first7=D |last8=Barbier |first8=P |last9=French Departments Of |first9=Paediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The syndrome is named after Dr. [[Douglas Reye]], who, along with fellow physicians Drs. Graeme Morgan and Jim Baral, published the first study of the syndrome in 1963 in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reye RD, Morgan G, Baral J |title=Encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the viscera. A Disease entity in childhood|journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue= 7311|pages=749–52 |year=1963 |pmid=14055046 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(63)90554-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, the occurrence of the syndrome may have first been reported in 1929. Also in 1964, Dr. George Johnson and colleagues published an investigation of an outbreak of influenza B that described 16 children who developed neurological problems, four of whom had a profile remarkably similar to Reye syndrome.  Some investigators refer to this disorder as Reye-Johnson syndrome, although it is more commonly called Reye syndrome. In 1979, Dr. Karen Starko and colleagues conducted a case-control study in Phoenix, Arizona and found the first statistically-significant link between aspirin use and Reye syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Starko KM, Ray CG, Dominguez LB, Stromberg WL, Woodall DF |title=Reye's syndrome and salicylate use| journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1980| volume=66|issue=6| pages=859–864|pmid=7454476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in Ohio and Michigan soon confirmed her findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortimor|first=Edward A., Jr.|title=Reye Syndrome-Ohio, Michigan|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|issue=29|date=June 1, 1980|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|pmid=7079050|volume=69|pages=532, 810–2|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611051716/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|archivedate=June 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to the use of aspirin during an upper respiratory tract or chickenpox infection as a possible trigger of the syndrome.  Beginning in 1980, the CDC cautioned physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses.  In 1982 the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory, and in 1986 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] required a Reye syndrome-related warning label for all aspirin-containing medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aspirin Labels to Warn About Reye Syndrome|author=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064153/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Single RCBR module.JPG|thumb|A single RCBR module]]

The '''rotating cell biofilm reactor (RCBR)''' is a new type of biological process based on [[biofilm]] active sludge used in [[Wastewater treatment|wastewaters treatment]]. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of [[rotating biological contactors]] plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of rotating biological contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using – instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree – many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented by the fact that the biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.

The intrinsic message of this technology is obvious: ''“transform a waste into a resource for the environment”''.

After a first settling and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to be treated (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified waters can be drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these waters can be used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.

[[File:RCBR core component.JPG|thumb|RCBR rotating cell containing bacterial carriers]]

== Functioning ==
A stainless steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1–3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, where there are wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, [[Heterotrophic microorganism|heterotrophic]] bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] concentration and then the development of [[Autotrophic nutrition|autotrophic]] bacteria. They belong to the [[nitrosomonas]] and [[nitrobacter]] category and they are able to oxidize ammonium, transforming it into [[nitrites]] and [[nitrates]].
The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters [[denitrification]]. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation – alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere – to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.

[[File:Combined RCBR Modules.JPG|thumb|Two combined RCBR modules]]

== Configuration ==
RCBR technology is an entirely water biological treatment system, able to make more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium [[nitrification]]. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).

== Consumption and maintenance ==
This biofilm system does not need any blower to oxygenate the bacteria colonies. It's the simple cell rotation to produce the oxygenation by simple diffusion. The energetic costs of this technology are really cheap and they are related only to the rotational movement impressed by an electric engine to the reaction cell, to maintain the device in a slow movement. The application of RCBR technology generally gets a reduction of the 90% of the water treatment electrical costs, with a medium consumption of 0.25 kWh per cubic meter of purified water.
RCBR's low consumption makes very easy to match these plants with renewable energy, like photovoltaic or aeolian plants. RCBR devices'  mechanical plant does not need any important operations of routine maintenance or any specialized technical expertise to control their operation. In fact, just the common greasing of the cell supporting rotation is requested.

== The invention ==
RCBR is an invention of Italian chemist Sergio Modenese. The first patent of the RCBR technology was registered in July 2013, by an innovative startup from Trentino Alto Adige, of whom the inventor is one of the founder partners.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople''' ({{lang-ru|Русский археологический институт в Константинополе}}) was founded in 1895 and led by two distinguished Russian Byzantinists, [[Fyodor Uspensky]] and [[Nikodim Kondakov]]. The institute carried out excavations and studies across the entire [[Ottoman Empire]], carrying off large numbers of relics, manuscripts and other finds to Russia. Aside from its research role, the institute was from the outset intended as a statement of foreign policy, following the [[Russian Empire]]'s claim to be the inheritor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as the "[[Third Rome]]", and its long-standing ambition to conquer [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] from the Ottoman Empire. The institute continued to function until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914.

The '''Schering Bridge''' is an [[electrical circuit]] used for measuring the insulating properties of electrical cables and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myclassbook.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/schering-bridge-measurement-of-capacitance/ ''Schering Bridge (Measurement of Capacitance)''], Myclassbook, 2 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[bridge circuit]], developed by [[Harald Schering]]. It has the advantage that the balance equation is independent of frequency. 

The connections of the Schering bridge under balance conditions are shown in the figure below.

In this diagram:
* C1 = [[capacitor]] whose capacitance is to be determined,
* R1 = a [[series resistance]] representing the loss in the capacitor C1,
* C2 = a standard capacitor,
* R3 = a variable [[induction (electricity)|non-inductive]] resistance,
* C4 = a variable capacitor,
* R4 = a non-inductive resistance [[in parallel]] with the variable capacitor C4.

'''Sexual jealousy''' is a special form of [[jealousy]] in [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationships, present in [[animal]]s that reproduce through [[internal fertilization]], and is based on suspected or imminent [[sexual infidelity]]. It is founded on the [[instinct]] of keeping [[gene]]s in the [[gene pool]] and expecting sexual partners to care for the [[offspring]]. The concept is studied in human and non-human [[primates]] in the field of [[evolutionary psychology]].

''Evolutionary psychologists'' have suggested that there is a gender difference in sexual jealousy driven by men and women's different reproductive biology.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The state of affairs: Explorations in infidelity and commitment|last=Duncombe, J., Harrison K., Allan., G, &amp; Marsden., D|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For men it is felt as a threat to his relationship's future because he could be cuckolded into raising children that are not his own. For women they can lose their relationship and all the benefits that entails to another. Research has shown that men are impacted more by sexual infidelity, while women are more impacted by emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Strategies of Human Mating|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=239–260|year=2006|url=http://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/09/strategies_of_human_mating2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation is from a ''social-cognitive perspective''. Typically men will place a lot of importance on their masculinity and sexual dominance. When the male's partner commits infidelity, these two components of his ego become severely threatened which is why men are more upset when a partner has sex with someone else. In contrast, women invest a lot of emotion into a relationship and will experience a threat to their self-perception when a partner commits infidelity, hence why women are more concerned with emotional infidelity rather than the sexual kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some research has suggested that there are no sex differences in sexual jealousy, concluding that males and females both equally experience distress over emotional and sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal but how it manifests itself may differ across cultures.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hupka|first2=R|date=1987|title=Cross-cultural differences in the elicitation of sexual jealousy.|jstor=3812538|volume=23|issue=1|pages=12–22|ref=Buunk, Bram; Hupka, Ralph B.

Psychologists have found that males react very strongly to sexual infidelity, whereas females are more likely to forgive a one-time sexual adventure if it does not threaten the male [[parental investment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The moral animal: Why we are, the way we are: The new science of evolutionary psychology.|last = Wright, R.|publisher = Vintage|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, jealousy is likely to be evoked in females if they feel that their partner may leave them for another woman; this has been shown to be more likely to occur if the male commits emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emotional infidelity occurs when one partner develops a meaningful, emotional attachment with someone outside of their primary romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy|last = Salovey, P.|publisher = The Guildford Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional jealousy ===
Many studies have shown that females tend to place a stronger emphasis on the emotional aspect of infidelity, over the sexual aspect; it is this emotional infidelity that becomes the focus of female sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most direct evidence for female's focus on emotional jealousy comes from Buss et al. (1992)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; who presented participants with scenarios in which they were asked to choose between a partner's sexual unfaithfulness and a partner's emotional unfaithfulness as the most distressing event. They found that more females than males reported a partner's emotional infidelity as the most distressing event. As well as using self-report measures, the researchers measured the participants' physiological responses ([[heart rate]] and [[electrodermal activity]]) to the scenarios; women were also found to be more physiologically upset to the idea of their partners committing emotional infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male sexual jealousy manifests itself in the emotion of jealousy, using or threatening with violence to ensure sexual exclusivity and the inclination to control women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This idea of males ensuring sexual exclusivity has also led to laws on [[adultery]].

From an [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]], the jealousy arises from this threat of investing in non-biologically related offspring and thus is most strongly felt over their mate's sexual [[infidelity]] than their emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Expression in females ===

==== Aggression ====
While most empirical research suggests that males are more likely to act aggressively in response to sexual jealousy, some studies have shown that females may also display aggression and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mind of her own: The evolutionary psychology of women|last=Campbell, A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have been found to report that their hypothetical sexual jealousy would manifest itself as anger and physical aggression towards the man. It has been suggested that this is because women are more empathetic towards the "victim", triggering strong aggression towards the unfaithful man.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Cross, C. P., &amp; Campbell, A.

| issue=5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not known if these hypothetical reports would become actions in real life situations. Furthermore, statistics on [[domestic violence]] continue to show that in relationships it is primarily men who are the abusers, rather than the women.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

On the other hand, it has been suggested that because it is the woman that ultimately chooses the mate, aggression caused by infidelity is directed at the rival female. As a result, when a woman is around a suspected rival female, she is more likely than a male counterpart to announce that her companion is "taken", and go out of her way to enhance her appearance to her spouse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Self-blame ====
Following infidelity, women are more likely to focus their sexual jealousy on their own relationship and self-blame. Women are also more likely to experience symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] following the infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Evidence for the interpretation that in jealousy situations women focus more on their own functioning as a partner comes from research by Dijkstra and Buunk (2002).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This research suggests that unlike men's jealousy, women's jealousy stems more from comparing their own qualities with those of the rival. That is, the higher the level of [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]], a personality characteristic referring to the tendency to compare one's characteristics with those of others, the more jealousy various rival characteristics evoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1991-98375-000|title=Intimate relationships|last=Brehm, S.

==== Mate guarding behaviour ====
''See main page:'' [[Mate guarding in humans]]

One behaviour arising from male's sexual jealousy towards their partner's sexual infidelity is mate guarding. These tactics are used to prevent partner infidelity and so might be used when there are perceived threats in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Aaron T.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|last4=Euler|first4=Harald A.|last5=Hoier|first5=Sabine|last6=Schmitt|first6=David P.|last7=LaMunyon|first7=Craig W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Mate retention, semen displacement, and human sperm competition: a preliminary investigation of tactics to prevent and correct female infidelity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886904001722|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=38|issue=4|pages=749–763|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2004.05.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It results in several behaviours, researchers have documented up to 19 different tactics used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David|date=1988|title=From vigilance to violence: Tactics of mate retention in American undergraduates|url=|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|volume=9|issue=5|pages=291–317|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(88)90010-6|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes (but is not exclusive to):
* [[Violence]] directed towards competitors, 
* Taking up all of the mate's time so that they have no time to meet other potential mates,
* Emotionally manipulate their mate,
* Increase their possession signals with jewellery,
* Enhancing their appearance.

=== Attachment style ===
According to [[attachment theory]], the quality of a child's interactions with caregivers during times of need shape their future interactions; this includes later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~psykliff/pubs/publications/at2.pdf|title=Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications|last=Cassidy, J.|publisher=The Guildford Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that insecure-avoidant individuals tend to report more sexual jealousy than those who are securely attached. This may be due to the fact that, in comparison to securely attached individuals, those who are insecurely attached tend to experience lower levels of trust, intimacy and stability in their romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal

H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex drive ===
[[Libido|Sex drive]], also known as libido, is the physiological need for sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relation between sex drive and sexual attraction to men and women: A cross-national study of heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual men and women|last = Lippa, R. A.|date = 2007|journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior|doi = 10.1007/s10508-006-9146-z|pmid = 17380375|volume = 36|issue = 2|pages = 209–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex drive has been found to be a significant predictor of higher sexual jealousy in both men and women; those who had a higher sex drive showed greater distress at the idea of their partner committing sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is consistent with other empirical research that has shown that individuals who value sexual gratification highly were more likely to be distressed by sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; To explain this finding, researchers have suggested the key threat that sexual infidelity poses for individuals with a high sex drive is loss of access to sexual gratification, as their partner is granting sexual access to a third person.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Relationship quality ===
Research has shown that individuals who reported high jealousy scores had more stable and successful relationships than individuals who reported comparatively low jealousy scores.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jealousy and envy.|last = East, M. P., &amp; Watts, F.

== Explanations ==
Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain sexual jealousy in both males and females. In addition, some of these explanations can be used to explain the sex differences in sexual jealousy and why there may be differences in the degree to which people experience jealousy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Evolutionary psychology perspective ===

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the core function of sexual jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal

For males, their biggest concern when they commit to a relationship is ensuring that any offspring produced is biologically theirs, therefore, sexual infidelity is a huge threat to them as there is then a chance that they are not the [[Genetics|genetic]] parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a male raises a child that is not genetically his own, he has effectively wasted his resources raising another man's child, that will not pass on any of his genes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As women have genetic certainty when they bear a child this is not a concern to them, however, women do face a different evolutionary problem. If her partner becomes emotionally attached to another woman, there is a real chance that the male may share his resources with the other woman, or leave their current relationship all together. Either way, the female loses some of the male parental investment; the loss of her mate’s resources may significantly reduce the survival of herself and her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The evolutionary psychology perspective has been supported by a study conducted by David Buss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|date=2013|title=Sexual jealousy|url=|journal=Psychological Topics|volume=22|pages=155–182|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that male sexual jealousy is triggered by sexual infidelity, whereas female sexual jealousy was triggered by emotional infidelity. The study concluded that sexual jealousy may be an adaptive function in which is triggered in order to retain access to a valuable mate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Researchers David Buss and Todd Shackleford propose and test several hypotheses about sexual jealousy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackleford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997|title=From vigilance to violence: Mate retention tactics in married couples|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=72|issue=2|pages=346–361|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.346|pmid=|citeseerx=10.1.1.387.7053}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is younger than them, than men whose partner is older than them'''. This hypothesis rests on the evolutionary principle of [[Mate Value|mate value]]. Younger women are likely to have more mate value because they are more [[Fertility|fertile]]. Therefore, it is predicted that men are likely to engage in mate retention behaviours more often when their partner is younger rather than older than them.
# Resting on the principle of mate value again, is the prediction that '''men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is perceived to be [[physically attractive]], than when their partner is perceived to be less physically attractive'''. Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive.
# '''Women will allocate more resources to mate retention when their partner has a wealth of resources than women whose partners have few resources'''. This hypothesis also rests on the mate value principle. Men who have more resources and wealth have a higher mate value than those who do not.
# '''If a man perceives his partner as having a higher mate value than him, then he is more likely to engage in efforts towards mate retention than men who perceive their partners as having a lower than or equal to mate value than them.''' This hypothesis rests on perceived mate value. If a male's partner has a higher mate value than him, she is more likely to be able to attract other men who may be of a similar mate value to her. As such, the male is at a greater risk of losing her to another man with a higher mate value.
# '''Individuals who suspect their partners are being unfaithful are more likely to devote effort towards mate retention than those who do not suspect their partners are being unfaithful.''' This hypothesis relies on the perceived probability of infidelity. Men risk being cuckolded into raising children that are not genetically his, and women risk losing their mate's resources and time.
Their research provided evidence to support all above hypotheses except for hypothesis 5; this effect was unique to men only.

The double-shot hypothesis (also known as the two-for-one hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitty|first=M.T|last2=Quigley|first2=L.L.|date=2008|title=Emotional and sexual infidelity offline and in cyberspace.|journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.2008.00088.x|pmid=19017185|volume=34|issue=4|pages=461–468|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/83753/7/WRAP_Emotional%20and%20Sexual%20infidelity_Whitty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that women have a belief that men can have sexual relations without emotionally committing themselves. Women also believe that for men, to have emotional commitment, sex is a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desteno|first=D.A|last2=Salovey|first2=P|date=1996|title=Evolutionary origins of sex differences in jealousy?

=== Social-cognitive perspective ===
As both forms of jealousy are threatening to both men and women, the social-cognitive perspective suggests that there are no inherent, evolutionarily induced gender differences. Instead, both emotional and sexual jealousy are believed to occur when an individual believes that a rival is posing a threat to what one perceives to be a valuable interpersonal relationship. When the relationship or one's self-esteem is threatened, jealousy is evoked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The perspective also provides explanations as to why men would be more upset by sexual infidelity than women. Men are socialized to be masculine, which includes having great sexual prowess. If a man’s partner commits sexual infidelity, this brings into question his sexual prowess and therefore threatens his masculinity. This results a strong, negative reaction in response to the sexual infidelity, which does not tend to occur in response to emotional infidelity. In contrast, women are taught to be emotional nurturers in a relationship, therefore, if their partner commits emotional infidelity, this may threaten her sense of self more than if her partner commits sexual infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The social-cognitive perspective also proposes the '''''transactional model of jealousy''''', which can be used to explain why there may be differences in the degree to which individuals experience sexual jealousy within genders, as well as between genders. This model examines how three variables – (1) [[Physiological arousal|arousability]], (2) [[Personal commitment|commitment]] and, (3) insecurity – moderate jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

# Individual differences in sexual jealousy are determined by the difference in levels of ''physiological arousal'': individuals who are easily aroused have more intense jealous reactions, than those with lower physiological arousal
# ''Commitment'' refers to the degree of dedication a person has in the relationship: the more committed a person is to a relationship, the greater the threat of loss, which leads to greater feelings of jealousy
# ''Insecurity'' refers to the perceived level of commitment of the partner: if we perceive our partner to be uninvolved or disinterested in the relationship, we feel more insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The degree to which these factors are experienced together determine the intensity of sexual jealousy felt by an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Culture  ==
Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal and affects both men and women.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; However, the extent of sexual jealousy varies across cultures. Sexual jealousy is strongly mediated by culture in both heterosexual and homosexual couples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=R.O.|date=1990|title=The Relationship Between Culture, Personality, and Sexual Jealousy in Men in Heterosexual and Homosexual Relationships|url=http://search.proquest.com/psycinfo/docview/617891480/113308AE58FC4D14PQ/2?accountid=14888|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|doi=10.1300/j082v19n03_04|pmid=2212631|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=19|issue=3|pages=67–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  in males, is said to be prevalent in cultures in which heritability runs through the male side.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=W|last2=Eagly|first2=A.H.|date=2002|title=A cross-cultural analysis of the behavior of women and men: implications for the origins of sex differences.|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.699|pmid=12206191|volume=128|issue=5|pages=699–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evocation ===

There are cross-cultural differences in behaviours that evoke sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Specifically, one study focused on seven different countries: Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Different behaviours were found to elicit different extents of sexual jealousy. For instance, flirting, kissing and sexual involvement elicit sexual jealousy across all of the nations. However, dancing, hugging and kissing evoke very different reactions across cultures. In the Soviet Union, the most sexual jealousy is seen across dancing, hugging, flirting and kissing behaviours. Yugoslavian participants display the most intense sexual jealousy to flirting behaviour but the least to kissing. Dutch participants show the least sexual jealousy to kissing, dancing and hugging behaviours.

=== In Western cultures ===
Societies that permit extra-marital sexual relations, often discourage sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canela: Bonding through kinship, ritual, and sex.|last=Crocker|first=W|last2=Crocker|first2=J|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|year=1994|isbn=|location=Fort Worth, TX|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Denmark very low sexual jealousy rates are determined by the very low 10% disapproval of extra-marital sex. On the other hand, individuals in the American Midwest show high feelings of sexual jealousy which corresponds to the 90% disapproval of extra-marital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=H.T.|date=1973|title=Attitudes toward marital infidelity: A nine-cultural sampling of university student opinion.|url=|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|jstor=41600842|volume=4|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American men also feel more sexual jealousy compared to German men&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buunk|first=B.P.|last2=Angleitner|first2=A|last3=Oubaid|first3=V|last4=Buss|first4=D.M.|date=1996|title= Sex differences in jealousy in evolutionary and cultural perspective: Tests from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States.|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/7/6/359.short|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00389.x|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=7|issue=6|pages=359–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked which would cause them more distress: i) a partner having formed a strong emotional attachment with another person or ii) a partner having passionate sexual intercourse with another person. Scenario i) measured sexual jealousy and scenario ii) measured emotional jealousy. The American men reported 33% greater sexual and emotional jealousy compared to German men.

Greater sexual jealousy seen in American men may be because in American culture, love, sex, family relationships and marriage are strongly connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Sexual Tragedy|last=Ellis|first=A|publisher=Lyle Stuart|year=1962|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, when partners therefore entangle with others, loss of love and relationship, and therefore sexual jealousy, is likely to be felt.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiederman|first=M.W|last2=Allgeier|first2=E.R|date=1993|title=Gender differences in sexual jealousy: Adaptionist or social learning explanation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309593900116|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(93)90011-6|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=115–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in Western culture, inducement of sexual jealousy is more likely by females in their partners compared to men. Inducing sexual jealousy is to increase their partner's attention towards them and counteract sexual and emotional jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=G.L.|date=1980|title=Inducing Jealousy A Power Perspective|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/6/2/222.short|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|doi=10.1177/014616728062006|pmid=|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=6|issue=2|pages=222–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Western culture now is mainly monogamous which is very different to the environment in which the majority of evolution thus far has occurred.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Therefore, evolutionarily it is likely that different past cultures also showed differences in sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== In Eastern cultures ===
Cross-cultural comparisons between China and United States reveal that, regardless of nation, men show greater sexual jealousy than women. Females show significantly higher levels of emotional jealousy. In contrast, between the nations, both men and women from the United States show greater sexual jealousy than Chinese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geary|first=David C|last2=Rumsey|first2=Michael|last3=Bow-Thomas|first3=Christine|last4=Hoard|first4=Mary K|date=1995|title=Sexual jealousy as a facultative trait: Evidence from the pattern of sex differences in adults from China and the United States.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309595000577|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00057-7|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=16|issue=5|pages=355–383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary India, sexual jealousy is a primary cause of violence towards women compared to other causes. Approximately fifty-one per cent of the violence towards women in an Indian sample was due to sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panchanadeswaran|first=S|last2=Koverola|first2=C|date=2005|title=The voices of battered women in India|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/11/6/736.abstract|journal=Violence Against Women|doi=10.1177/1077801205276088|pmid=16043569|access-date=19 March 2016|volume=11|issue=6|pages=736–758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, between 1880 and 1925, there were a large number of suicides amongst Indian immigrants on plantations in Fiji that reports attributed to sexual jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sites of desire/economies of pleasure: Sexualities in Asia and the Pacific.|last=Manderson|first=L|last2=Jolly|first2=M|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual Jealousy was high amongst these immigrants due to the disproportionate number of sexes: high numbers of men to few women. In suicide reports, sexual jealousy was described as a "racial trait" in Indian men and that it was evoked when European men slept with their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=B.V|date=1985|title=Veil of Dishonour: Sexual jealousy and suicide on Fiji plantations|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|doi=10.1080/00223348508572516|pmid=11617439|jstor=25168874|volume=20|issue=3|pages=135–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations for cross-cultural differences ==

=== Evolutionary psychology model ===
The differences feelings of the jealousy across cultures provides support for the evolutionary psychological model. Different weightings are given to triggers of sexual jealousy cross-culturally. In liberal cultures, male mating effort is based on the number of women. These men therefore invest less time in each woman and, therefore, exhibit less sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Paternity certainty ===
Paternity certainty is the extent to which a male knows or believes that a woman's child is his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=P.J.|date=1978|title=Promiscuity, paternity, and culture.|journal=American Ethnologist|doi=10.1525/ae.1978.5.1.02a00110|pmid=|volume=5|pages=151–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In polygamous societies, men feel greater sexual jealousy when there is low paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This is because they don't want to risk losing time, energy and resources to a child that is not theirs.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Socio-economic differences between cultures also affects paternity certainty.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; In "natural fertility" countries, such as Namibia, 96% of males show sexual jealousy.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scelza|first=B.A.|date=2014|title=Jealousy in a small-scale, natural fertility population: the roles of paternity, investment and love in jealous response.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513813001219|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.11.003|pmid=|access-date=2 March 2016|volume=35|issue=2|pages=103–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is greater likelihood of paternity loss and uncertainty due to lack of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This provides another explanation for why industrialised countries tend to show lower sexual jealousy compared to pre-industrialised.

"'''Teddy'''" is a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]], completed on November 22, 1952 and originally published in the January 31, 1953
issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', Salinger created an engaging child character, Teddy McArdle, to introduce to his readership some of the basic concepts of [[Zen]] enlightenment and [[Vedanta]] reincarnation – a task that Salinger recognized would require overcoming some 1950s American cultural chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "In 1952, most Americans thought their way of life superior to that of Eastern cultures. Salinger was well aware of this chauvinism. It was clear to him that his reading audience was not going to accept the notions of mysticism or reincarnation easily."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger wrote "Teddy" while he was arranging publication for a number of his [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|short stories]] and crafted the story to balance and contrast the collections' intended opening work "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]".&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;

In Salinger's novella, "[[Seymour: An Introduction]]", a meditation written by a member of the fictional Glass family, [[Buddy Glass]] writes about his brother, [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], where Buddy claims authorship to "Teddy" as well as other pieces in ''Nine Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;Wenke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The story comprises several vignettes which take place aboard a luxury liner. The events occur roughly between 10:00 and 10:30 am on October 28, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teddy is Theodore "Teddy" McArdle, a 10-year-old mystic-savant returning home to America with his entertainer-socialite parents and his younger sister. As part of their tour of [[Great Britain]], Teddy has been interviewed as an academic curiosity by professors of religious and philosophical studies - the "Leidekker examining group" - from various European universities in order to test his claims of advanced spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first scene opens in the McArdles' stateroom. Teddy is standing on his father’s expensive suitcase, peering out of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "His father, a bellicose actor and not in the best of moods, struggles to assert his authority over his child. Teddy’s mother lies under the covers in bed, taunting her husband and listlessly issuing commands to Teddy in an attempt to irritate his father."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates the nature of existence and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from [[Zen]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to his father and mother, they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.

Teddy is ordered to retrieve his six-year-old sister, Booper, who has absconded to the sport deck with her father’s expensive camera, which Teddy -  indifferent to its material value -  has bestowed upon her as a plaything. 
As he departs, Teddy delivers a short, cryptic caveat to his parents, informing them that they may never see him again outside the realm of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Main Deck, Teddy has a brief encounter with one of the ship's female officers, Ensign Mathewson. Forthright and exacting,  the boy questions the officer and obtains information about a shipboard word game competition - and disabuses the bemused woman as to her misapprehensions regarding his advanced intellectual development.

Teddy proceeds to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts the girl to return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.

The final scene takes place on the Sun Deck, where Teddy, reclining on one of his family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following ''non sequitur'': “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen. It is ridiculous to mention it even.”

Teddy is interrupted by a passenger named Bob Nicholson, a graduate of an unnamed university, who teaches curriculum and instruction. Nicholson is on a first name basis with the Leidekker group and has listened to a taped interview with Teddy, in which he shows a lurid interest. He peppers Teddy with questions on the boy’s commitment to the precepts of Vedantic reincarnation; Teddy remains composed in the face of the young man’s veiled hostility, and provides him with a brief sketch of this discovery of God, his relationships with his parents and his views on Zen philosophy. The boy offers Nicholson an extended metaphor on the nature of logic that challenges the young man’s rational and orthodox commitment to material reality. Teddy, in explaining his position on death and reincarnation gives a hypothetical example describing a series of events at his upcoming swimming lesson in which a fatality occurs: his own.

Teddy disengages from the interview and hurries to his lesson. Nicholson pursues him through the levels of the ship's decks, and as he begins to descend the stairs to the swimming pool, he hears the scream of "a small, female child" emanating from the enclosed walls of the indoor pool. The story ends on this ambiguous note.

==Analysis==

===The porthole and the orange peel===

In the opening scene set in the Mr. and Mrs. McArdle's state room, Salinger presents two facets of Zen enlightenment: "God-consciousness", a profound awareness of "inner spirit", in contrast to material concerns, and secondly, "the notion of impermanence", based on "the Vedantic belief that separate existence is an illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy, perched on a piece of luggage, pokes his head through the open porthole, penetrating figuratively into a zone of enlightenment and sublimity; his body remains in the cabin, where his parents – “materialistic and self-centered” – engage in mildly abusive repartee, issuing petulant and ineffectual commands to their son, who endures them with tolerant detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy’s astonishing self-possession is a product of his adherence to Vedantic “philosophy of non-attachment”, enabling him to distinguish between “the world of illusion” – the material world – and “the world of reality”, where “only unity of God is real.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy focuses his attention on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “[[Solipsism|solipsistic]] contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this door, I may only exist in the minds of all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237: “It foreshadows the story’s ending…”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booper===

The same studied disengagement that characterizes Teddy’s relationship with his parents also informs the “amazing” toleration he exhibits toward his younger sister – a child that biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes as “a cruel little girl” and “perhaps the most vicious child ever discharged by Salinger’s imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booper announces that she “hates everybody in the ocean”, Salinger calls attention to the setting of his story: the sea, with its infinite horizons and indefinite boundaries where his characters drift – a seascape that reflects “the Zen and Vedantic concepts of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy’s tolerance of his sister is due to his understanding that few reincarnations have contributed to the six-year old’s spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238: “[Teddy] recognizes that  she has only just begun her spiritual journey and has many reincarnations ahead of her.”&lt;/ref&gt; Booper’s misanthropic persona make plausible her role in the sinister and unsettling denouement at the swimming  pool.

===Bob Nicholson===

The final vignette occurs on the Sun Deck. Bob Nicholson, a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, is acquainted with some members of the Leidekker group who examined Teddy; he engages the boy in an ''ad hoc'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238: “[Nicholson] imposes himself on Teddy and begins to pepper him with philosophical questions.”&lt;/ref&gt; This serves two purposes in Salinger’s story. First, he functions as a foil to Teddy,  posing logical questions challenging the tenets of Vendantic and Zen philosophy. Salinger uses this device to respond to hostile skeptics among his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p.238: “Nicholson’s character serves two purposes. Salinger uses him as a sounding board against which Teddy can express Vedantic and Zen viewpoints that Nicholson reacts to skeptically.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slawenski, Nicholson “embodies the logic that poisons God-consciousness, and he represents the power of the intellect to blind individuals from spiritual truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson additionally functions as a witness to Teddy’s final discourse on the nature of existence and death, in which the boy formulates the circumstances that might lead to his reincarnation. In a lull in their exchange, Teddy becomes momentarily distracted by an inner voice or vision, and spontaneously recites to Nicholson two haiku by the 17th Century poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]: “Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die” and “Along this road goes no one, this autumn eve.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson, pursuing Teddy to the indoor swimming pool, hears, but does not see, the event that the boy prophesied, providing the reader with tantalizing evidence that leaves the boy's ultimate fate a mystery.

===The "swimming pool ending"===

The ending of Salinger’s “Teddy” has been described as “controversial” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 1999,  p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; and “the most widely criticized ending of any story that he ever wrote.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger thrice provides the  reader with intimations of Teddy’s demise: in statements to his parents, in his diary and to Nicholson. This has led readers to interpret the final passage as confirmation of the boy’s premonition  i.e. Booper shoves her older brother into the empty concrete pool and screams when she sees the deadly consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239: “Most readers have interpreted the closing lines of “Teddy” as indicating Teddy’s death at the hand of Booper. This conclusion is derived from Teddy’s own predictions rather than the text itself.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Slawenski reports two additional interpretations that might be derived from the final passage. One option is that Teddy “recognizing the threat his sister poses” evades her thrust and pushes her to her death, as act of premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; A third option is that both children plunge into the empty basin when Teddy carries Booper with him off the precipice – in order to advance her into her next reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these" says Slawenski, "is very satisfying."

Critics of the story may have targeted the ending for disapproval, rather than engage in a culturally biased critique of Salinger’s foray into Zen philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240: “[T]he story's critics – many of whom found fault with in its Eastern tenets – conveniently delivered the brunt of disapproval to the story's ambiguous ending, rather than condemn cultural philosophies they did not understand.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger himself regarded the work as “exceptionally Haunting [sic]” and “memorable” yet “unpleasantly controversial” and “thoroughly unsuccessful.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;
