}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(10 December 1870&amp;nbsp;– 23 August 1933) was an Austrian and Czech architect and influential European theorist of [[modern architecture]]. His essay ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'' advocated smooth and clear surfaces in contrast to the lavish decorations of the [[fin de siècle]] and also to the more modern aesthetic principles of the [[Vienna Secession]], exemplified in his design of [[Looshaus]], [[Vienna]]. Loos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of [[Modernism]] in architecture and design and developed the "Raumplan" (literally ''spatial plan'') method of arranging interior spaces, exemplified in [[Villa Müller]] in [[Prague]].

Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce. He suffered from poor health, including an inherited hearing affliction, and was involved in a pedophilia scandal. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in [[Kalksburg]] near [[Vienna]].

==Early life==
Loos was born on 10 December 1870 in [[Brno]], in the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] region of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], today the eastern part of the [[Czech Republic]]. His father, a German [[stonemason]], died when Loos was nine years old.&lt;ref name="Life and influence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/LifeAndInfluence.aspx|title=Adolf Loos: Life and influence|accessdate=20 June 2012|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|pages=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170143/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/LifeAndInfluence.aspx|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Adolf Loos had inherited his father's hearing impairment and was significantly handicapped by it throughout his life. His mother continued to carry on the stonemason business after her husband's death. Loos attended several [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] schools, a technical school in [[Liberec]] and graduated 1889 from a technical school in Brno. He later studied at [[Dresden University of Technology]]. He left one year later without completing his study.

==Career==
At age 23, Loos traveled to the United States and stayed there for three years from 1893–96. While in the United States, he mainly lived with relatives in the Philadelphia area, supported himself with odd jobs and also visited other cities such as the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, [[St. Louis]] and New York.  Loos returned to Vienna in 1896 and made it his permanent residence. He was a prominent figure in the city and a friend of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Arnold Schönberg]], [[Peter Altenberg]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]].

Inspired by his years in the [[New World]] he devoted himself to architecture. After briefly associating himself with the Vienna Secession in 1896, he rejected the style and advocated a new, plain, unadorned architecture. A utilitarian approach to use the entire floor plan completed his concept. Loos's early commissions consisted of interior designs for shops and cafés in Vienna.

===Architectural theory===
Loos authored several polemical works. In ''Spoken into the Void'', published in 1900, he attacked the Vienna Secession, at a time when the movement was at its height.&lt;ref name="Royal Institute of British Architects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Writings.aspx |title=Adolf Loos: Writings |accessdate=20 June 2012 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects |pages= |quote=  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118180625/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Writings.aspx |archivedate=18 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essays, Loos used provocative catchphrases and is noted for the essay/manifesto entitled ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', given in a lecture in 1910 and first published in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Stewart, ''Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism'', London: Routledge, 2000, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the idea that the progress of culture is associated with the deletion of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] from everyday objects, and that it was therefore a crime to force craftsmen or builders to waste their time on ornamentation that served to hasten the time when an object would become obsolete ([[design theory]]). Loos' stripped-down buildings influenced the minimal massing of modern architecture, and stirred controversy. Although noted for the lack of ornamentation on their exteriors, the interiors of many of Loos's buildings are finished with rich and expensive materials, notably stone, marble and wood, displaying natural patterns and textures in flat planes, executed in first rate craftsmanship. The distinction is not between complicated and simple, but between "organic" and superfluous decoration.

Loos was also interested in the decorative arts, collecting sterling silver and high quality leather goods, which he noted for their plain yet luxurious appeal. He also enjoyed fashion and men's clothing, designing the famed Kníže of Vienna, a [[haberdashery]]. His admiration for the fashion and culture of England and America can be seen in his short-lived publication ''Das Andere'', which ran for just two issues in 1903 and included advertisements for 'English' clothing.&lt;ref name="Royal Institute of British Architects"/&gt; In 1920, he had a brief collaboration with [[Frederick John Kiesler]] - architect, theater and art-exhibition designer.

===Loos House and other projects===
From 1904 on, he was able to carry out big projects; the most notable was the so-called "Loos House" (built from 1910–12), originally for the Viennese tailor Goldman and Salatsch, for whom Loos had designed a store interior in 1898, and situated right across from the [[Habsburg]] city residence [[Hofburg Palace]]. The house, today called Michaelerplatz 3, Vienna, and under monument preservation, was criticized by its contemporaries. The facade was dominated by rectilinear window patterns and a lack of stucco decoration and awnings, which earned it the nickname "House without Eyebrows"; Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] was said to have despised the modern building so much that he avoided leaving the Hofburg Palace through a main gate in its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.stadtbekannt.at/haus-ohne-augenbrauen/ |title=Haus ohne Augenbrauen &amp;#124; Stadtbekannt Wien &amp;#124; Das Wiener Online Magazin |publisher=Stadtbekannt.at |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work also includes the store of the men's fashion house Knize (built 1909–13), Am Graben 13, [[Café Museum]] (built 1899), Operngasse 7, Vienna, and the "American Bar" (built 1907–08), Kärntnerstrasse 10, Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.architektenlexikon.at/de/362.htm#Werke |title=Architekturzentrum Wien |publisher=Architektenlexikon.at |date= |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loos visited the island of [[Skyros]] in 1904 and was influenced by the cubic architecture of the Greek islands. When the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] collapsed after [[World War I]] Loos was awarded [[Czechoslovakia]]n citizenship by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|President Masaryk]].&lt;ref name="Life and influence"/&gt; His main place of residence remained in Vienna. During the [[First Austrian Republic]] Loos became interested in public projects. He designed several housing projects for the City of Vienna ([[Red Vienna]]). From 1924–28 Loos lived in Paris. He taught at the Sorbonne and was contracted to build a house for [[Tristan Tzara]], which was completed 1925 in Avenue Junot 15, Paris. In 1928 he returned to Vienna.

Loos had an admiration for classical architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Hanno-Walter Kruft. ''A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present''. Princeton Architectural Press, 1994 and [[Edward Chaney]], Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook, 2006) page 361&lt;/ref&gt;  which is reflected in his writings and his entry to the [[Tribune Tower#Design competition|1922 Chicago Tribune competition]]. Loos' submission was a massive doric column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Wainwright |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/top-10-unbuilt-towers-chicago-tribune-tower-by-adolf-loos/5023198.article |title=Top 10 unbuilt towers: Chicago Tribune Tower, by Adolf Loos |work=bdonline.co.uk/ |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
===Marriages===
Loos was married three times. In July 1902, he married drama student {{Interlanguage link multi|Lina Loos|2=de|3=Lina Loos|preserve=1}}. The marriage ended three years later in 1905. In 1919, he married 20-year-old Austrian-born {{Interlanguage link multi|Elsie Altmann|2=de|3=Elsie Altmann-Loos|preserve=1}}, a dancer and operetta star and daughter of Adolf Altmann and Jeannette Gruenblatt. They divorced seven years later in 1926. In 1929 he married writer and photographer [[Claire Loos|Claire Beck]]. She was the daughter of his clients Otto and Olga Beck, and 35 years his junior. They were divorced on 30 April 1932.&lt;ref name="Loos 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loos|first=Claire Beck|title=Adolf Loos – A Private Portrait|year=2011|publisher=DoppelHouse Press|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their divorce, Claire Loos wrote ''Adolf Loos Privat'', a literary work of snapshot-like vignettes about Loos's character, habits and sayings, published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna in 1936. The book was intended to raise funds for Loos's tomb.

===Poor health===
All his life, Loos suffered from a hearing impairment. When he was a child, he was deaf. He only acquired partial hearing at the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/adolf-loos |title=Adolf Loos Facts |publisher=Biography.yourdictionary.com |date=1933-08-23 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Loos was diagnosed with cancer. His stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. By the time he was 50 he was nearly deaf.

===Child abuse===
In 1928 Loos was disgraced by a pedophilia scandal in Vienna. He had commissioned young girls aged 8 to 10, from poor families to act as models in his studio. The indictment stated that Loos had exposed himself and forced his young models to participate in sexual acts. He was found partially guilty in a court decision of 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/andreas.weigel/pdfs/Adolf-Loos-Gerichtsurteil |format=PDF |title=[Rechtskräftiges Gerichtsurteil Adolf Loos] 7 Vr 5707/28/71 |publisher=Members.aon.net |accessdate=2015-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704060147/http://members.aon.at/andreas.weigel/pdfs/Adolf-Loos-Gerichtsurteil |archivedate=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the original case record was rediscovered and confirmed the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, Der Fall Loos. Amalthea 2015. {{ISBN|3850029085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falter.at/falter/2015/02/03/ornament-und-verbrechen/ |title=FALTER » Ornament und Verbrechen |publisher=falter.at |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Villa-Mueller-Prag-3.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Müller]] in Prague]]
Adolf Loos exhibited early signs of dementia around the time of his court proceedings. A few months before his death he suffered a stroke. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in [[Kalksburg]] near [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Bock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bock | first = Ralf | title = Adolf Loos | publisher = Skira | location = Geneve | year = 2007 | isbn = 88-7624-643-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loos's body was taken to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] to rest among the great artists and musicians of the city, including [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], Altenberg and Kraus, some of his closest friends and associates.&lt;ref name="Loos 2011"/&gt;

Through his writings and his groundbreaking projects in Vienna, Loos was able to influence other architects and designers, and the early development of Modernism. His careful selection of materials, passion for craftsmanship and use of 'Raumplan'-the considered ordering and size of interior spaces based on function—are still admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Raumplan.aspx|title=Adolf Loos: Raumplan|accessdate=20 June 2012|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|pages=|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512180402/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/AdolfLoos/Lifeandinfluence/Raumplan.aspx|archive-date=12 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish art has often reflected European trends while maintaining its unique character. The [[Kraków]] school of Historicist painting developed by [[Jan Matejko]] produced monumental portrayals of customs and significant events in Polish history.

A '''Bachelor of Fine Arts''' ('''BFA''', '''B.F.A.''') is the standard [[undergraduate]] [[Academic degree|degree]] for students in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] seeking a professional education in the [[visual arts|visual]] or [[performing arts]].

==Background==
In the United States, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical BFA program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general [[liberal arts]] studies. For a BA in Art, the ratio might be reversed.

The [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] (NASAD), which accredits Bachelor of Fine Arts programs in visual art and design in the United States, states that "the professional degree (BFA) focuses on intensive work in the visual arts supported by a program of general studies," whereas "the liberal arts degree (BA) focuses on art and design in the context of a broad program of general studies."

A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree will often require an area of specialty such as [[acting]], [[musical theatre]], [[game design]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[computer animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[dramatic writing]], [[drawing]], [[fiber]], [[film production]], [[visual effects]], [[animation]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[visual arts]],  [[Technical_director|technical arts]], [[interior design]], [[metalworking]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music|music]], [[new media]], [[painting]], [[photography]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[stage management]], or [[television production]]. Some schools instead give their students a broad education in many disciplines of the arts.

Although a Bachelor of Fine Arts is traditionally considered a four-year degree, a BFA program may take longer to complete because of the amount of studio course work required.

==Other countries==
In some countries such a degree is called a Bachelor of Creative Arts (BCA). In the [[United Kingdom]] the equivalent degree is the Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Fine Art. In [[Australia]] the Bachelor of Fine Arts is awarded to students completing a degree in visual and [[performing arts]]. Specific degrees such as the Bachelor of Dance or Bachelor of Drama are used by some performing arts institutions in Australia and much of [[Europe]]. In [[India]] a Fine Arts undergraduate degree is known as a BFA or BVA (Bachelor of Visual Arts). It is a four-year degree.

The '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a highly ornate and often extravagant [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century.  It followed the [[Renaissance style]] and preceded the [[Rococo]] (in the past often referred to as "late Baroque") and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. It was encouraged by the [[Catholic Church]] as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of [[Protestant]] architecture, art and music, though [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed in parts of Europe as well.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.  The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called ''[[rocaille]]'' or ''[[Rococo]]'', which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.

==Origin of word==
The word ''baroque'' was a Portuguese term for a pearl (barocco) with an irregular shape. Cognates for the term in other Romance languages include: ''barroco'' in Portuguese, ''barrueco''&lt;!--Antes de corregir esto al "barroco", por favor, verifique la fuente citada, y tenga en cuenta que esta palabra es un sustantivo que significa "perla barroca".--&gt; in Spanish, and ''barocco'' in Italian.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary on-line definition of Baroque&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in French to describe pearls in a 1531 inventory of [[Charles V of France|Charles V's]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=CMdwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR28&amp;lpg=PR28&amp;dq=baroque+1531+Oxford+English+Dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zptCm4Wxki&amp;sig=45xkAmnoROBehwvsaY3xADkg_jc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE1rnTsNDYAhULtRQKHZrrBXQQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%201531%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary&amp;f=false Michael Meere, ''French Renaissance and Baroque Drama: Text, Performance, Theory''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, {{ISBN|1611495490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the term was usually used to describe music.  In an anonymous satirical review of the première of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' in October 1733, which was printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher,  wrote in 1768 in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'':   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"&gt;''Encyclopedie''; ''Lettre sur la Musique Francaise'' under the direction of [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used to describe the period of art that followed the [[Renaissance]] in 1855 by the Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in an article in the journal ''[[Cicerone|Le Cicerone]]''. He used the term to attack the movement for subverting the values of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, "Les Styles en Architecture'', (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "style baroque" did not enter into the [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|dictionary]] of the [[Académie française]] until 1878, when it lost its original negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |chapter=What is Baroque? |title=Three Essays on Style |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |page=19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, the art historian [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] published the first serious academic work on the style, ''Renaissance und Barock'', which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, ''Les Styles en Architecture'' (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture: origins and characteristics==
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Triumph of the Name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Quadratura'' or [[trompe-l'œil]]  ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] (1669–1683)]]
The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the [[Catholic Church]] at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545–63, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The first phase of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers.  The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, J. Quentin (1953). [http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.01(1952-55)/MH.1(1953)2/orig05.pdf The Influence of Italian Mannerism Upon Maltese Architecture]. ''Melitensiawath''. Retrieved 8 July 2016. pp. 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005), p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
Another feature of baroque churches are the ''quadratura''; [[trompe-l'œil]] paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. ''Quadratura'' paintings of [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church.  Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective,  to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.

The interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque,  and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome.  The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] (1647–53) and the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|Baldachino of St. Peter]] (1623–34), both by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was "compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome".&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.
The [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration.  These were large plaques of carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions.  For the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.

===Italian Baroque architecture===
[[File:Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (early 17th century)]]
[[File:Santa Maria della Salute in Venice 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice (1631–1687)]]
The first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.

In Rome in 1605, [[Paul V]] became the first of series of [[popes]] who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes [[Urban VIII]] and [[Alexander VII]]. The sculptor and architect [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose major work was the Church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–46).  The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"/&gt;

Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and [[trompe-l'œil]] architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included ''The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise'' by [[Andrea Pozzo]] (1685–1695) in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of Saint Ignatius]] in Rome, and ''The triumph of the name of Jesus'' by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy:  It appeared in Venice in the church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] (1631–1687) by [[Baldassare Longhena]], a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola.  It appeared also in Turin, notably in the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]  (1668–1694) by [[Guarino Guarini]]. The style also began to be used in palaces;  Guarini designed the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in Turin, while Longhena designed the [[Ca' Rezzonico]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], (1657), finished by [[Giorgio Massari]] with decorated with paintings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pages 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of massive earthquakes in [[Sicily]] required the rebuilding of most of the, and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.

The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture.  The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in [[Madrid]], begun in 1643 by [[Pedro de la Torre]].  It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cathedral in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the ''Obradorio'', added between 1738 and 1750 by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]]. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] in [[Seville]] by [[Leonardo de Figueroa]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"&gt;Cabanne (1988) pgs. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Granada]] had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque.  The painter, sculptor and architect [[Alonso Cano]] designed the Baroque interior of [[Granada Cathedral]] between 1652 and his death in 1657.  It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.

Some of the most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the period was designed by the brothers [[Churriguera]], who worked primarily in [[Salamanca]] and Madrid. The [[Church of San Esteban (Salamanca)|Church of San Esteban]] in Salamanca (1693) is one of the most ornate baroque churches anywhere. Their other works include the buildings on the city's main square, the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]] (1729).&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include [[Pedro de Ribera]], a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and [[Narciso Tomé]], who designed the celebrated [[El Transparente]] altarpiece at [[Toledo Cathedral]] (1729–32) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain;  their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in [[Tepotzotlán]], with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe and ''Rococo'' (1740s–1770s)===

[[File:Wies altar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Wiesekirche in Bavaria by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745–1754)]]
From 1680 to 1750,  many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in central Europe, in Bavaria, Austria, and what is now the Czech Republic.  Some were in [[Rococo]] style,  a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged out of the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéristique des Styles'' (2014), page 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable architects included Johann Fischer von Erlach, [[Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] in Bavaria, [[Balthasar Neumann]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Bruhl]], and [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]] in Dresden. In Prussia, [[Frederic II of Prussia]] was inspired the [[Grand Trianon]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], and used it as the model for his summer residence, [[Sanssouci]], in [[Potsdam]], designed for him by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] (1745–1747). Another work of baroque palace architecture is the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Potsdam]], the former orangerie of the palace of the Dukes of [[Saxony]] in the 18th century.

One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]], a pilgrimage church located near the town of [[Bad Staffelstein]] near Bamberg, in [[Bavaria]], southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]] and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact center of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies ({{lang-de|Wieskirche}}). It was designed by the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|J. B.]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]], in the municipality of [[Steingaden]] in the [[Weilheim-Schongau]] district, [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the [[Wessobrunner School]]. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Another notable example is the [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] in Prague (1704–55), built by [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]]. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels,  Light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of colored stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration.  The architecture is transformed into a theater of light, color and movement.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"/&gt;

===French Baroque or ''Classicism''===
{{main|French Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Château de Balleroy 25.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chateau de Balleroy]] by [[François Mansart]] (1626–1636)]]
[[File:Château de Versailles 04 2016 5737.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Versailles]] (begun by [[Louis Le Vau]] in 1661)]]
France largely resisted the ornate baroque style of Italy, Spain, Vienna and the rest of Europe. The French Baroque style (often termed ''Grand Classicism'' or simply ''Classicism''  in France) is closely associated with the works built for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV]]; it features more geometric order and measure than baroque, and less elaborate decoration on the facades and in the interiors.  Louis XIV invited the master of baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Louis Le Vau]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pages 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal architects of the style included [[François Mansart]] ([[Chateau de Balleroy]], 1626–1636), [[Pierre Le Muet]] (Church of [[Val-de-Grace]], 1645–1665), [[Louis Le Vau]] ([[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], 1657–1661) and especially [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Robert de Cotte]], whose work included the [[Galerie des Glaces]] and the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles (1687–1688). Mansart was also responsible for the Baroque-classicism of the [[Place Vendôme]] (1686–1699).&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major work of the period was the [[Palace of Versailles]], begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter [[Charles Le Brun]]. The gardens were designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate [[Petit Trianon]] and the highly ornate theater. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly [[Peter the Great]] of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at [[Peterhof Palace]] near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Baroque===

[[File:The Great Church of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, iconostasis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Great Church of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg, by Rastrelli (1753–1759)]]
The debut of Russian Baroque, or [[Petrine Baroque]], followed a long visit of [[Peter the Great]] to western Europe in 1697–98,  where he visited the Chateaux of Fontainebleu and Versailles and other architectural monuments.  He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, when he moved the Russian capital there in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine baroque include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; called [[Elizabethan Baroque]]. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;* William Craft Brumfield.

==Painting==
{{Main|Baroque painting}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''The Raising of the Cross'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1610–1611)]]

[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Quadratura''; a painted dome by [[Andrea Pozzo]] for the [[Jesuit Church, Vienna]], giving the illusion of looking upwards at heavenly figures around a nonexistent dome (1703)]]
Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it.  In their palette, they used intense and warm colors, and particularly made use of the [[primary colors]] red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;   In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures.  In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.  Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions.  They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the center of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical or horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement.  They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pgs. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Toilet of Venus, by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[François Boucher]] (1755)]]
The earliest Baroque painters were the Italians the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci| Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio's realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.    Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Andrea Pozzo]], and [[Paolo de Matteis]] in Italy; [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] in Spain; [[Adam Elsheimer]] in Germany; and [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Georges de La Tour]] in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy).  Poussin and La Tour adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than colour.  

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] was the most important painter of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] style.  Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

One important domain of Baroque painting was ''Quadratura'', or paintings in ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'', which literally "fooled the eye".  These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels saints, and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéistique des Styles'' (2014), pg. 92 &lt;/ref&gt;  

In Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; [[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]] (1633–39), to glorify the reign of [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pages 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Boucher]] was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period.  He designed tapestries, carpets and theater decoration as well as painting.  His work was extremely popular with [[Madame Pompadour]], the Mistress of King [[Louis XV]]. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
{{Main|Baroque sculpture}}
[[File:Teresabernini.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''Ecstasy of St. Teresa'', by [[Bernini]] (1647–1652)]]
[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Bust of [[Louis XIV]] by Bernini, Versailles (1665)]]
The dominant figure in baroque sculpture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  Under the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]], he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican, including the imposing [[Chair of St. Peter]] beneath the dome in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]  In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'' (1999), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque sculpture was particularly inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous statue of [[Laocoön]] from the First Century A.D., which was on display in the gallery of the Vatican.  When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the Academy of painting and sculpture, he advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature.  He told the students, "When I had trouble with my first statue, i consulted the ''Antinous'' like an oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1999) page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late French baroque sculptors included [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] and [[Jean Baptiste Pigalle]].  Pigalle was commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to make statues for Frederick's own version of Versailles at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback found in St. Petersburg.

In Spain, the sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Rosary Chapel of the Church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca, Mexico (1724–31).

==Music and ballet==
{{Main article|Baroque music|Baroque dance}}

[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], (1678–1741)]]
The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term 'baroque' for music were criticisms.  In an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous ''Encylopedié'' of [[Denis Diderot]]:   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"/&gt;

Common use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans-title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=German|pages=7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

The baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation. New forms were invented, including the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. [[Opera]] was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly lost ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe:   Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music,  In 1669, the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theater in France open to the public, and premiered ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'', the first grand opera in French, with music by [[Robert Cambert]], with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"&gt;Bély, Lucien, ''Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde'' (2005), pp. 152–54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

The classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by [[Marie de Medici]], and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. [[Louis XIV]] himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the [[Académie Royale de Danse]], was founded by the King.  It was the first professional dance school and company,  and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"/&gt;

Several new instruments, including the [[piano]], were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], as the Keeper of the Instruments. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristofori named the instrument ''un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte'' ("a keyboard of [[cypress]] with soft and loud"), abbreviated over time as ''pianoforte'', ''fortepiano'', and later, simply, piano.&lt;ref&gt;Isacoff (2012, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
[[File:Set design Act5 of Andromède by P Corneille 1650 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Set design for ''Andromedé'' by [[Pierre Corneille]], (1650)]]

The Baroque period was a golden age for theater in France and Spain;  playwrights included [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Moliere]] in France; and [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] Spain.

During the Baroque period, the art and style of the theater evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet.  The design of newer and larger theaters, the invention the use of more elaborate machinery, the wider use of the [[proscenium arch]], which framed the stage and hid the machinery from the audience, encouraged more scenic effects and spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica on-line, ''Baroque Theater''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by [[Lope de Vega]], but also by [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gaspar Aguilar]], [[Guillén de Castro]], [[Antonio Mira de Amescua]], [[Luis Vélez de Guevara]], [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]], [[Diego Jiménez de Enciso]], [[Luis Belmonte Bermúdez]], [[Felipe Godínez]], [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]] or [[Juan Pérez de Montalbán]]. The second period is represented by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] and fellow dramatists [[Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón]], [[Jerónimo de Cáncer]], [[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla]], [[Juan de Matos Fragoso]], [[Antonio Coello y Ochoa]], [[Agustín Moreto]], and [[Francisco Bances Candamo]].&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderón's.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII).

Lope de Vega introduced through his ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609) the ''new comedy''. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three [[Aristotle]] unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.&lt;ref&gt;Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, ''The Convicted Suspicions'' and ''[[The Trickster of Seville]]'', one of the first versions of the [[Don Juan]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992). ''Historia de la literatura española: Siglo De Oro: Teatro'' (1492–1700). Editorial Ariel, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival to Madrid, [[Cosimo Lotti]] brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of [[Buen Retiro]], of [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] and of [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of [[Autos sacramentales]] achieved high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Molina Jiménez,  María Belén (2008). El teatro musical de Calderón de la Barca: Análisis textual. EDITUM, p. 56
&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known German playwright was [[Andreas Gryphius]], who used the [[Jesuit]] model of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pierre Corneille]]. There was also [[Johannes Velten]] who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the [[commedia del'arte]]  with the classic theatre of Corneille and [[Molière]]. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

==End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery==
Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, probably without intending it, contributed to the decline of the baroque and rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named Royal Director of buildings in 1754. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting of architecture. {{sfn|Cabanne|1988|pg. 106}} 

The pioneer German art historian and archeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture.  By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism.  The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: "Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pierre de Cortone in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Bruce, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'', Thames and Hudson, (1997), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;    In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic [[John Ruskin]] declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss-born art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his Renaissance und Barock (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favor.  The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.

'''Bethel College''' is a four-year private Christian [[liberal arts]] college in [[North Newton, Kansas|North Newton]], [[Kansas]], United States.  It is affiliated with the [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==History==

===Early years===
Founded in 1887 and conferring its first four-year degrees in 1912, Bethel is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Starting in 1874, thousands of [[Russian Mennonite]]s began arriving in Kansas. In 1882, having a century of experience running their own schools, they opened Emmental, a training school for teachers, between Newton and [[Goessel, Kansas]]. The school was moved to [[Halstead, Kansas]], in 1883. A better site was found in North Newton, Kansas, and the cornerstone of the main building was laid on October 12, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;The cornerstone was laid by Andrew B. Shelly (1834–1913), then president of the General Conference Mennonite Church. (Kaufman, p. 73.)&lt;/ref&gt; This structure, the current Administration Building, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The Administration Building has been on the Historic Register since March 16, 1972.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Campus relocation===
The Halstead school was closed for the 1892–1893 school year while it was relocated to the new site and reopened as Bethel College in 1893. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]] (now known as the ''Mennonite Church USA''), replacing [[Wadsworth Institute]] which had closed in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/location/campus-map/#!ad_building Administration Building page] of the Bethel College website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Newton===
During the 1880s, Kansas cities and towns competed with one another to create, build, and construct many institutions and buildings including colleges. On May 11, 1887, representatives of the Newton community and the Kansas Conference of Mennonites signed a charter for Bethel College to be built on a plot of about {{convert|120|acre|km2}}. Over a year later on October 12, 1888, around 2,500 people gathered on the property to lay the cornerstone of what is today the Administration Building of Bethel College.   The building project took around five years to fully complete. The fund-raising to create the institution was slow, but on September 20, 1893 there was a service of dedication held for the building to be opened, and classes began.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===First college president===
Cornelius H. Wedel, a young teacher, was made Bethel College's first president. There were 98 students – 77 men and 21 women ages 13 to mid-30s – living on the west end of the main floor and the ground floor of the Administration Building.  Wedel and his family lived on the east end of the Administration Building's main floor.  The classrooms, chapel, and library of 600 volumes were located on the second floor. In those days, the students were up by five in the morning and in bed by ten at night. Each student worked two hours a day at a campus job.  Student conduct was strictly monitored.  Men and women were not allowed to be in the library during the same evenings; they alternated each evening. Five men, including the president, made up the first faculty. They taught classes in the Bible, church history, German, [[English studies|English]], mathematics, science, and music. Bethel College was a bilingual college until early 1918, when the U.S. entered [[World War I]]. German was removed from the curriculum, but later reinstated: as of the 2011–2012 school year, two years of German were offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethel College German Language|url=http://www.bethelks.edu/academics/areas/german/|publisher=Bethel College|accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration Building was the main campus structure until 1925 when the Science Hall was completed. The cornerstone for Memorial Hall was laid in 1938, and the building was completed in 1942. The Art Center has also been in place for many years. In 1952 the [[Mennonite Church USA Archives|Mennonite Library and Archives]] was built. In 1979, the current student center/cafeteria was built. The newest building is the Thresher Stadium in the Thresher Sports Complex. The Krehbiel Science Center was completed in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

There are three student residence halls located on campus.  They are Haury Hall (completed in 1958 and expanded in 1963), Warkentin Court (completed in 1966), and the newer Voth Hall (completed in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/about-the-college/125th-anniversary/history-of-bethel/ History of Bethel College]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luyken Fine Arts Center includes the Krehbiel Auditorium and Prairie Sky Stage for stage performances, lectures and events; the Robert W. Regier Art Gallery which hosts exhibits by local, regional, national and international artists, including Bethel alumni, in all types of media; and houses the music, drama and communication arts departments.

== Organization and administration ==
{{As of|2017}} the college president was John K. Sherriff.&lt;ref name="Bethel-Admin"&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/people/administration/ Administration; Bethel College.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic profile ==
Bethel's curriculum is founded on a general education program in the liberal arts and [[sciences]], and is geared toward students of moderate to high academic ability. There are requirements for the study of religion, and a cross-cultural experience.{{Clarify|date=May 2017}} The college offers majors in the traditional liberal arts disciplines and selected career areas, and accredited professional programs in [[nursing]], [[social work]], athletic training, and teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelks.edu/ Official Bethel Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==
[[Image:bethel-voth.jpg|thumb|Voth Hall, student housing, 2007]]

Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

In the 2006–07 season, three of Bethel's coaches were named [[Conference (sports)|conference]] Coach of the Year. The Threshers have won more than 55 conference titles. In 1998–99  six of the ten Thresher teams won conference [[champion]]ships. At Bethel College the athletes also compete academically; 89 student athletes have been named American Scholar Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethelthreshers.com/ Athletics of Bethel College]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Coal Miner's Daughter'''" is an autobiographical 1969 [[country music]] song written and performed by [[Loretta Lynn]]. Released in 1970, the song became Lynn's [[signature song]], one of the genre's most widely known songs, and provided the basis for both her autobiography and a movie on her life.

==About the song==
"Coal Miner's Daughter" tells the story of her life growing up "in a cabin on a hill in [[Butcher Hollow, Kentucky|Butcher Holler]]", while her father, Melvin "Ted" Webb, worked all night in the [[Van Lear, Kentucky|Van Lear]] [[Coal mining|coal mine]]. The song depicts the real story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Kentucky, and discusses how she and her seven siblings lived off of a coal miner's salary ("''Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay''"), and that her father always made sure there was love in the Webb household.

Subsequent verses recall Lynn's other childhood experiences and hardships, such as her mother reading the [[Bible]] by a coal-oil light or having bloody fingers from constantly doing the laundry using an abrasive "warsh" board (this pronunciation was reflective of her Appalachian Kentucky roots),&lt;ref name="Montgomery, 1004"&gt;Montgomery, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'', 1004.&lt;/ref&gt; ordering shoes from a mail-order catalog, and working so hard every day that everyone slept because "they were tired."

In the song's final verse, the now-adult Lynn returns to her homestead, which has since been abandoned ("''Not much left but the floor; nothing lives here anymore ...''"). However, she remarks that the "memories of a coal miner's daughter" remain.

"Coal Miner's Daughter" was unlike anything Lynn had ever recorded previously. She had become known for her sassy back-talking songs, including "[[Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) (song)|Don't Come Home A' Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)]]" (an angry-wife's warning to a hard-drinking husband not to come home drunk and intent on making love) and "[[Fist City]]" (wherein a married woman threatens her husband's would-be temptress). However, fans quickly reacted to the song with praise and turned the song into one of country music's iconic hits.

==Chart performance==
Lynn recorded "Coal Miner's Daughter" in October 1969, but the song's release was delayed until October 1970. The song slowly climbed the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart during the latter half of the year, and reached No. 1 on December 19 for a single week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to reaching No. 1 on the Country charts, "Coal Miner's Daughter" also was Lynn's first single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 83.

An album of the same name was also released in 1970, and despite the fact that the title track was the lone single, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' became quite successful.

==Legacy==
"Coal Miner's Daughter" served as the name of Lynn's 1976 autobiography, ''Coal Miner's Daughter: The Autobiography'', which Lynn co-wrote. The song title also served as the name of Lynn's 1980 biographical motion picture on her life, ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]''. The movie starred actress [[Sissy Spacek]] as Lynn and [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Lynn's husband. The film's soundtrack featured Spacek singing all of Lynn's hits sung in the movie, including "Coal Miner's Daughter". 

"Coal Miner's Daughter" helped provide a better understanding of Lynn, and led to the widespread fascination with her life story.

The song was listed at No. 185 on RIAA's list of ''[[Songs of the Century]]'' and was also listed in 2003's TV special at No. 13 on ''CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music''.

In 2010 the Library of Congress put "Coal Miner's Daughter" on the National Recording Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2009/|title=2009 - National Recording Preservation Board|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover versions==
Few singers have released cover versions of Lynn's hit, as it is a biographical song about Lynn's life. However, there have been several karaoke sing-along versions made in the past ten years.

The most famous cover of the song is the version recorded by [[Sissy Spacek]] for the motion picture, which is also featured on the soundtrack. The soundtrack peaked at #2 on the Billboard country album chart and at #40 on the Top 200 chart. In Canada the soundtrack peaked at #1 on the country album chart and #23 on the pop album chart. The single off the soundtrack peaked at #23 on the Billboard country singles chart and at #7 on the Canada country singles chart.

Loretta Lynn re-recorded the song with guest vocals from [[Miranda Lambert]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] in 2010 for ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute To Loretta Lynn]]''. Additionally, this recording was released as a single in September 2010. This version of the song debuted and peaked at #55 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week dated December 4, 2010. They also recorded a music video of the song and it became a CMT top ten hit. Additionally they were nominated for a Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music and a CMT Video award for the effort.

[[Stella Parton]], little sister of Lynn's good friend [[Dolly Parton]], also recorded the song on her 2010 album, "American Coal."

Lynn re-recorded the song for her 2018 album ''[[Wouldn't It Be Great]]''. The album is composed by songs all written by Lynn. Coal Miners Daughter being the closing song on the album just as Loretta does in her live performances.

==Parodies==

The song was parodied as ''Cow Minder's Daughter'' by Laraine Newman, who portrayed the fictional east Indian singer "Govinda Lynn" in a skit during episode 20 of season 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/79/79t.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Buck Henry: 05/24/80 |website=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1980-05-24 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the US comedy series [[Saturday Night Live]], first broadcast May 24, 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">Juvenile law pertains to those who are deemed to be below the [[age of majority]], which varies by country and culture. Usually, minors are treated differently under the law. However, even minors may be prosecuted as adults.

== Summary ==
In both [[France]] and the [[United States]], some actions are prohibited to minors, such as the underage consumption of alcohol or tobacco, truancy, running away from home, and ungovernability. A minor can thus become a [[status offender]].

===United States===
In the United States, the juvenile varies in definition from state to state. The system applies to anyone between the ages of 6 to 10, depending on the state, and 18;&lt;ref&gt;[[American juvenile justice system]]&lt;/ref&gt; except for 11 states (including Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas), where a juvenile is a person under 17 and New York and North Carolina, where it is under 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[juvenile law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, criminal majority begins at 16, 17, or 18.

The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act of 1974 set up four key requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html The federal ''Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130182242/http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba235.html |date=2006-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for US minors:
* Firstly, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, moving them from juvenile hall to community-based or family-based environments.
* Secondly, segregation (sight and sound separation) between juvenile and adult offenders
* Thirdly,  strong limitation for the juvenile justice system to put juveniles in adult jails.
*Fourthly, the protection of minority groups from being overrepresented in high-security facilities.

All states participate except South Dakota and Wyoming.

===France===
France has three stages of minors:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fr.jurispedia.org/index.php/Minorité_pénale_%28fr%29 Jurispedia, Minorité pénale]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* The infant, still without a perception of acts yet, commits no offence and so cannot be convicted.
* A minor between 7/8 and 13 has his own discernment. No criminal punishment but only educative measures can be pronounced against him, according to a 2002 law.
* A minor between 13 and 18 who commits an offence can have punishment that is educational or, in special cases, criminal.

The criminal irresponsibility of children under 13 is defined by the Article 122-8 of the Criminal Code. Those between 13 and 18 are assumed to be irresponsible, but they can be involved in a criminal sentence if the circumstances and the juvenile's delinquent personality justify.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
According to Jean Pierre Rosenczveig, a children's judge in [[Bobigny]], near [[Paris]], the juvenile criminal law in France has six key requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Rosenczveig, Jean Pierre; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011342/http://www.rosenczveig.com/Nanterre/Fac2%20-%202006-2007.pdf Droit pénal des mineurs, étude de]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The specialization of the magistrate. Indeed, the juvenile criminal system has its own intervener: the children's judge, the court of assizes of minors, the court of appeal chamber of minors etc.
# Criminal relative responsibility begins at the age of 13.
# The priority is to educate, rather than punish. Article 2 of the order of February 2, 1945 imposes an educative-placing proposal to minors to whom a detention placing measure is considered.
# Parents have to be informed of their child's police custody. Moreover, Article 13 of the same order imposes an examination of the parents before the decision of the tribunal. Also, before the juvenile's police custody, the service for the legal protection of youth must be called.
# Requirement of an attorney for the juvenile. If he does not contact one, the jurisdiction has to do it for him.

In the US, the presence of an attorney is only recommended, not compulsory.

In most states, special courts try juveniles, but some like Colorado do not have them. Some crimes allow juvenile delinquents to be tried by the superior court (such as first-degree murderer or gang murder).

Juveniles also have special protections, in addition of juvenile courts, which are closed to the public in the US. In France, closing the court to the public (''huis clos'') is an option.  Just like in France, US parents or guardians have to be informed and to be present during the police questioning. At least, the names of juveniles are kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. Juvenile cases are heard by not a jury but a judge.

At least, the US criminal law system has a particular vocabulary for juveniles' cases. Indeed, juvenile offenders commit not a crime but a delinquent act. Also, courts use the term delinquent or not delinquent, instead of guilty or not guilty, just to show that a minor is different from a criminal.

Juveniles have the same rights as adults. They are assumed innocent, they are noticed of charges advance of any adjudication of delinquency, they have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and they have the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

After their arrest, in both countries, minors may be placed in provisory detention (until a [[European Convention on Human Rights]] case banned it in France) if the parents are prejudiced and informed. Provisory detention is done in a juvenile hall, separated from adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm US Info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713074258/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0701/ijdf/frjacsdb.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

US parents may be liable for the acts of their child if they failed their parent’s authority, an example being if the minor is involved in a gang offense. Also, juveniles have no right to bail.

As can be noted, UD and French procedures are not that different as they have a common goal: to protect, as much as possible, the interest of the minor offender. Nevertheless, except for detention (the separation from adults as well as parents' awareness), the priorities are different. The US prefers the confidentiality of minors, but France stresses accommodating the juvenile within the criminal system.

Both systems protect but not in the same way. In France, an attorney is compulsory. In the US, there is no jury.

As notef, the goal of the juvenile justice in France and the US is clearly to educate child offenders, rather than punish them, even if some measures can be severe.

== Sanctions incurred by minors ==
The order of February 2, 1945 relative to the childhood delinquency contains three measures to punish French minor offenders:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc52/lc525.html Sénat]'' in French&lt;/ref&gt;
* Firstly, the educational measure can be an admonition, a particular educational placing, under legal protection (up to five years) or a supervised freedom.
* Secondly, the mediation-retrieval measure in which the minor is involved in the reparation of the damage he caused. The victim must approve. A minor between 16 and 18 may be submitted to a general interest working.
* Thirdly, the imprisonment measure that may not exceed half of the adult imprisonment term. However, oldest minors (over 16) may have the same penalty as adults if the offence is serious.

The punishment depends of minor's age. As aforesaid, if he is under 7 or 8, he can have no punishment. If he is between 8 and 13, the sentence is nothing more than an educational punishment. If he is over 13, he can have both an educational and a criminal punishment, but the tribunal has to explain its decision according to the minor's personality and the circumstances.

The US is less divided. The penalry is equal for each juvenile offender over 10, and there is no stage differentiation between measures. However, the measures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoline.org/InformationLibrary/Documents/Juvenile%20Sanctions%20fj.asp Juvenile Sanctions, Info Online]&lt;/ref&gt; themsrlves are quite the same:
* Placing the delinquent in the care of an institution to take care of him
* Placing the delinquent in an alternative incarceration program
* Ordering the delinquent to participate in a treatment program
* Ordering the child to work in public buildings or private property
* Ordering the child to take part to the reparation of the damage he caused
* Committing the delinquent to the Department of Children and Families if his family is not adequate.

Since 1988, the death penalty for children who committed crimes has been outlawed. Also, in March 2005, the death penalty was outlawed for killers who committed their crimes before the age of 18. There were 72 peoples in [[death row]] concerned at the time.

As can be seen, the US and the French systems protect juvenile differently, but both protect effectively. There is also much stress on the prevention of delinquency in both countries.

The '''[http://www.cfsp.org/ Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty]''' (CFSP) is a private economic research consortium dedicated to studying the interaction of financial systems and poverty, using a variety of economic approaches in a range of developing countries.

The CFSP was established in 2009 by a grant to the University of Chicago from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162337/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2009/Pages/University-of-Chicago-OPP51935.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Robert M. Townsend]] ([[MIT]]) as Principal Investigator, and economists [[Juliano Assuncao]] ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro|PUC-Rio]]), [[Abhijit Banerjee]] ([[MIT]]), [[Francisco Buera]] ([[UCLA]]), [[Diamond-Dybvig model|Douglas Diamond]] ([[Booth School of Business]]), [[Weerachart Kilenthong]] ([[University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce]]), [[Gabriel de Abreu Madeira]] ([[University of São Paulo]]), [[Roberto Rigobon]] ([[MIT Sloan School of Management]]), [[Kenneth Singleton]] ([[Stanford]]), [[Tavneet Suri]] ([[MIT]]), [[Christopher Udry]] ([[Northwestern University]]), [[Christopher Woodruff]] ([[UCSD]]) as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsp.org/about/members |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109033328/http://www.cfsp.org/about/members |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFSP shares members with several other organizations that work in [[development economics]], including the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]], the [[Financial Access Initiative]], and [[Innovations for Poverty Action]]. In contrast to these organizations, however, which tend to focus on rigorous [[randomized evaluation]]s to generate policy recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.povertyactionlab.org/methodology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://financialaccess.org/research |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314233414/http://financialaccess.org/research |archivedate=2011-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poverty-action.org/about/mission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184224/http://www.poverty-action.org/about/mission |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CFSP attempts to connect traditional approaches in developmental economics to a wider range of approaches and models, including [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium models]] applied to both macro and regional financial systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsp.org/about/about-consortium/cfsp-vision-statement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109033313/http://www.cfsp.org/about/about-consortium/cfsp-vision-statement |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12105">The '''Critical Incident Technique''' (or '''CIT''') is a set of [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] used for collecting direct observations of [[human behavior]] that have critical significance and meet methodically defined criteria. These observations are then kept track of as incidents, which are then used to solve practical problems and develop broad [[psychological]] principles. A critical incident can be described as one that makes a  contribution—either positively or negatively—to an activity or phenomenon. Critical incidents can be gathered in various ways, but typically respondents are asked to tell a story about an experience they have had.

CIT is a flexible method that usually relies on five major areas. The first is determining and reviewing the incident, then fact-finding, which involves collecting the details of the incident from the participants. When all of the facts are collected, the next step is to identify the issues. Afterwards a decision can be made on how to resolve the issues based on various possible solutions. The final and most important aspect is the evaluation, which will determine if the solution that was selected will solve the root cause of the situation and will cause no further problems.

==History==
The studies of [[Sir Francis Galton]] are said to have laid the foundation for the Critical Incident Technique, but it is the work of Colonel [[John C. Flanagan]], that resulted in the present form of CIT. &lt;ref&gt; Flanagan, John C. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol. 51, No. 4, July 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
Flanagan defined the Critical Incident Technique as:

{{quote|[A] set of procedures for collecting direct observations of human behaviour in such a way as to facilitate their potential usefulness in solving practical problems and developing broad psychological principles ... By an incident is meant any specifiable human activity that is sufficiently complete in itself to permit inferences and predictions to be made about the person performing the act. To be critical the incident must occur in a situation where the purpose or intent of the act seems fairly clear to the observer and where its consequences are sufficiently definite to leave little doubt concerning its effects.&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"&gt; Page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Flanagan's work was carried out as part of the Aviation Psychology Program &lt;ref&gt; "Charged with recruiting other psychologists, Dr. Flanagan was asked to develop the Army Air Corp's program, and, by the end of the war, he had overseen the commissioning of over 150 psychologists. Within its ranks were some of the finest psychologists of the day, including five forthcoming presidents of the American Psychological Association and 11 members of its board of directors. Toward the close of the war, this group of psychologists was involved not only in conducting research regarding the selection and classification of aviators but was also involved in developing training programs and human factors engineering." http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2014/04/aviation-psychology.aspx, paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], where Flanagan conducted a series of studies focused on differentiating effective and ineffective work behaviors. Flanagan went on to found [[American Institutes for Research]] continuing to use the Critical Incident Technique in a variety of research.&lt;ref&gt;A Timeline of AIR History, American Institutes for Research http://www.air.org/page/air-history&lt;/ref&gt; Since then CIT has spread as a method to identify job requirements, develop recommendations for effective practices, and determine competencies for a vast number of professionals in various disciplines. In particular, it has been used in service research.

==Principal uses==
CIT can be used in training, [[systems design]] and [[accident investigation]]. It is an integral part of large scale [[task analysis]]. It identifies the most costly happenings in a complex environment where people and machines work as a system. Its origin in investigating [[pilot error]]s in wartime,&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;328 et seq&lt;/sup&gt; and other life-and-death situations, means it identifies top priorities in a man-machine system or other complex action-oriented situation. These priorities then feed into procedures for selection and training, and also (continuing the pilot example) into cockpit instrument design.&lt;ref&gt;Fitts P.M. &amp; Jones R.E 1947. ''Psychological aspects of instrument display: I. Analysis of 270 "pilot-error" experiences in reading and interpreting aircraft instruments''. U.S. Air Forces Materiel Command, Report No. TSEAA-694-12A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapanis, Alphonse 1959. ''Research techniques in human engineering''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, Chapter 3, Methods for the study of accidents and near-accidents.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[healthcare]], CIT is used in situations where direct examination of clinical staff and researchers can help them better understand their roles and help them solve practical problems. CIT allows clinical staff to better understand their roles in the clinical setting. Another advantage is that it helps them gain better knowledge about their interactions with patients and other clinicians. It also helps clinical staff better understand their practice from a variety of roles (e.g., [[physician]], [[nurse]], clinical educator, nurse informatician, faculty member). In healthcare research, CIT can be a good resource in identifying the experiences of a patient in the healthcare setting, exploring the dimensions of patient–provider interactions and determining patient responses to illnesses and treatments.

CIT is also widely used in [[organizational development]] as a research technique for identification of organizational problems and is suitable for knowledge management in project-based organizations&lt;ref&gt;Haussner et al (2018). [https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000626 "Exploring Internationally Operated Construction Projects through the Critical Incident Technique"]. ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 34(5).&lt;/ref&gt;. CIT is used as an interview technique, where the informants are encouraged to talk about unusual organizational incidents instead of answering direct questions. Using CIT deemphasizes the inclusion of general opinions about management and working procedures, instead focusing on specific incidents. 

In [[market research]], CIT has been used more frequently in the last ten years. Although the CIT method first appeared in the marketing literature thirty years ago, the major catalyst for use of the CIT method in service research appears to have been a ''Journal of Marketing'' study conducted by Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault (1990) that investigated sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service encounters. Since the Bitner et al. article, nearly 200 CIT studies have appeared in marketing-related literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gremler's article in ''Journal of Service Research'', Vol. 7, No. 1, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

CIT has also been used in studies of information-seeking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;"How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning" by Ethel Auster and Chun Wei Choo (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Information sources used by lawyers in problem-solving: An empirical exploration" by Margaret Ann Wilkinson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Is 'Enough' Enough? Modeling the Information-Seeking and Stopping Behavior of Senior Arts Administrators" by Lisl Zach (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The employment of CIT may also allow construction of typical scenarios of user behavior when they interact with various technologies including information systems. For this, researchers should solicit:

# the cause, description and outcome of a critical incident;
# users' feelings and perceptions of the situation;
# actions taken during the incident;
# changes (if any) in their future behavior.

The typical scenarios may be presented visually as a diagram or a [[causal model]].&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A. (2006). [http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_CIT_Agents.pdf "The use of interface agents for email notification in critical incidents"]. ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' 64(11): 1084–1098.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
By identifying possible problems associated with major user–system or product complications, CIT recommendations try to ensure that the same type of situations do not result in a similar loss. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using this method, as shown below.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Overall, however, CIT has been demonstrated to be a sound method since first presented in 1954.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Relatively few modifications have been suggested to the method in the more than 50 years since it was introduced, and only minor changes have been made to Flanagan's original approach, indicating reasonable robustness.

===Advantages===
* Flexible method that can be used to improve multi-user systems.
* Data is collected from the respondent's perspective and in his or her own words.
* Does not force the respondents into any given framework.
* Identifies even rare events that might be missed by other methods which only focus on common and everyday events.
* Useful when problems occur but the cause and severity are not known.
* Inexpensive and provides rich information.
* Emphasizes the features that will make a system particularly vulnerable and can bring major benefits (e.g. safety).
* Can be applied using questionnaires or interviews.
* Easy to understand.

===Disadvantages===
* A first problem comes from the type of the reported incidents. The Critical Incident Technique will rely on events being remembered by users and will also require the accurate and truthful reporting of them. Since critical incidents often rely on [[memory]], incidents may be imprecise or may even go unreported.
* The method has a built-in bias towards incidents that happened recently, since these are easier to recall.
* Respondents may not be accustomed to or willing to take the time to tell (or write) a complete story when describing a critical incident.
* Since this method is based on incidents it does not say anything about the everyday situation so it is not very representative.

[[Massimo Stanzione]]'s '''''David with the Head of Goliath''''' is exhibited at the [[San Diego Museum of Art]].

== History ==
In 1947, Mrs. Harry Turpin gifted a Stanzione original painting titled ''David With the Head of Goliath'' to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the [[San Diego Museum of Art]]); the work was then attributed to [[Jusepe Ribera|Ribera]], but was reattributed to Stanzione by Mario Modestini in 1951, an attribution confirmed by Schleier, Felton, Zeri, and Spinosa. The painting is dated to approximately 1630. [[Caravaggio]] was an important influence in Stanzione’s artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio’s brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of [[Goliath]]. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. [[Guido Reni]] and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione’s interpretation of [[chiaroscuro]]; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath’s forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath’s full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath’s dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.

{{Human growth and development}}

'''Human development''' is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the [[ovary]] of a female is penetrated by [[sperm]]. The egg then lodges in the [[uterus]], where an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develop until [[birth]]. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], and through [[adulthood]] to [[senility]], and are referred to as the process of [[ageing]].

==Before birth==
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
Development before birth, or '''prenatal development''' ({{ety|la|natalis|relating to birth}}) is the process in which an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develops during [[gestation]]. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, the first stage in [[embryogenesis]] which continues in fetal development until [[birth]].

===Fertilization===
{{Main|Fertilization}}
[[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|tbhhjgb|right|thumb|Sperm fertilizing an egg]] 
Fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane. The chromosomes of the sperm combine with those of the egg to form a single cell, called a zygote, and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=Prenatal Development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[zygote]] contains a full complement of [[genetic material]] and develops into the embryo. Briefly, embryonic developments have four stages: the morula stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the [[embryo]] remains in a protein shell, the [[zona pellucida]], and undergoes a series of cell divisions, called mitosis. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's [[uterus]]. This induces a [[decidual reaction]], wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the [[fetal membranes]] and the [[placenta]].  In humans, the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]] in the later stages of prenatal development.  The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.

===Embryonic development===
{{main|Human embryogenesis}}
[[Human embryogenesis]] refers to the development and formation of the human [[embryo]]. It is characterised by the process of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the [[embryo]] that occurs during the early stages of [[Human development (biology)|development]]. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[sperm]] cell successfully enters and fuses with an [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of [[prenatal development]] commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].
 
The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.

In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.

===Fetal development===
{{main|Fetus}}
A '''fetus''' is a stage in the human development considered to begin nine weeks after [[fertilization]].&lt;ref name="nursing"&gt;Klossner, N. Jayne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B47OVg25g-QC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=fetal+stage+begins&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dqQjWN-2jU&amp;sig=-KVkuIJggNo1T_gV6AHkcc58xyI&amp;hl=en Introductory Maternity Nursing] (2005): "The fetal stage is from the beginning of the 9th week after fertilization and continues until birth"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|title=First Trimester - American Pregnancy Association|author=|date=1 May 2012|website=americanpregnancy.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423022520/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|archivedate=23 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with many defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final location.

===Maternal influences===
{{See also|Placenta}}
The fetus and embryo develop within the [[uterus]], an organ that sits within the pelvis of the [[mother]]. The process the mother experiences whilst carrying the fetus or embryo is referred to as [[pregnancy]]. The [[placenta]] connects the developing [[fetus]] to the [[Uterus|uterine]] wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus's blood. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus's [[umbilical cord]] develops from the placenta. These organs connect the mother and the fetus.  Placentas are a defining characteristic of [[placental mammal]]s, but are also found in [[marsupials]] and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homology (biology)|homology]] of such structures in various [[Viviparity|viviparous organisms]] is debatable, and in invertebrates such as [[Arthropod]]a, is [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] at best.

[[File:Child development stages.svg|thumb|center|800px|Approximate outline of development periods in [[child development]].]]

The [[Tanner stages]] can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development.

===Puberty===
{{main|Puberty}}
'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes through which a [[child]]'s [[Human body|body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s: the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ]]s. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.

On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kail |first=RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC |title=Human Development: A Lifespan View |isbn=0495600377 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |page=296 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org"&gt;"For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16.

Notable among the [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man.

===Adulthood===
[[Biology|Biologically]], an '''adult''' is a [[human]] or other [[organism]] that has reached [[sexual maturity]]. In human context, the term ''adult'' additionally has meanings associated with [[social]] and [[Law|legal]] concepts. In contrast to a "[[Minor (law)|minor]]", a '''legal adult''' is a [[person]] who has attained the [[age of majority]] and is therefore regarded as independent, [[self-sufficient]], and [[:wikt:responsible|responsible]]. The typical age of attaining adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses [[Adult development|psychological adult development]]. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and responsibility that may define an adult.

==Organ systems==
{{Organ system development}}
Development of human [[organ (biology)|organs]] and [[organ systems]] begins in the embryo and continues throughout the human lifespan.

      <comment>Where language likely began ~~&gt; Hypothesized to have begun. (Wording was, as written, uncitable.)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6760">In [[linguistics]], '''displacement''' is the capability of [[language]] to communicate about things that are not immediately present (spatially or temporally); i.e., things that are either not here or are not here now.

In 1960, [[Charles F. Hockett]] proposed displacement as one of 13 [[design features of language]] that distinguish human language from [[animal communication]] systems (ACSs):

{{quote|Man is apparently almost unique in being able to talk about things that are remote in space or time (or both) from where the talking goes on. This feature—"displacement"—seems to be definitely lacking in the vocal signaling of man's closest relatives, though it does occur in bee-dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Charles F. |last=Hockett |authorlink=Charles F. Hockett |title=The origin of speech |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=203 |pages=88–96 |url=http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |accessdate=19 February 2011 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426023122/http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |archivedate=26 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In animal communication systems==
[[Honeybee]]s use the [[waggle dance]] to communicate the location of a patch of flowers suitable for foraging. The degree of displacement in this example remains limited when compared to human language. A bee can only communicate the location of the most recent food source it has visited. It cannot communicate an idea about a food source at a specific point in the past, nor can it speculate about food sources in the future.&lt;ref name="Yule"&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Yule |year=2010 |title=The Study of Language |edition=4th |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-76527-5 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, displacement in the waggle dance is restricted by the language's lack of creativity and productivity. The bees can express direction and distance, but it has been experimentally determined that they lack a sign for "above". It is also doubtful that bees can communicate about non-existent nectar for the purpose of deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul Georg |last=Meyer |year=2005 |title=Synchronic English Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=3rd |location=[[Tübingen]] |publisher=[[Gunter Narr Verlag]] |isbn=3-8233-6191-0 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, in honeybee communication, the potential for displacement is limited, but it is there insofar as they have the ability to communicate about something not currently present (i.e., something that is spatially removed).

[[Ant]]s have been observed sending out scouts to patrol for food items, and coming back for other workers if the food found is too large to bring to the nest by the finder alone, for example a dead caterpillar that is too heavy. This again would involve displacement by communicating outside of the here and now.  Recruitment has also been observed by the African [[Weaver Ant]] ''Oecophylla longinoda'' for the purpose of communicating new food sources, emigration to new sites, and for defense against intruders.  Researchers have described no less than five distinct systems to fulfill these functions in this species.&lt;ref&gt;Holldobler, Bert and Wilson, Edward O. 1977.  The Multiple Recruitment Systems of the African Weaver Ant ''Oecophylla longinoda'' (Latreille) (Hymenopetera: Formicidae) ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 3,19-60 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ants communicate using a system composed of olfactory or scent clues from several glands together with body movements.  The animals will use antennation, body jerking, and/or mouth-opening, and will combine these clues with the application of the scent trails or scent release to pass on information regarding resources or intruders.

[[Raven]]s (''Corvus corax'') have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal. However, at first glance their motivation for recruiting is less obvious, and the specifics of their communication system are more elusive.  Still, it has been documented that ravens must have such a system, as their patterns of gathering at sites clearly indicate that they must have been informed of the presence of the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. Winter foraging at carcasses by three sympatric  corvids, with emphasis on recruitment by the raven, ''Corvus corax''. ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'':3, 141-156 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B and Marzluff, J.M. Do common ravens yell because they want to attract others? ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 28, 13-21 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that non-mated ravens call in a group of other non-mated birds to be able to feed and not get chased away by mated territorial pairs of established ravens.

==Importance in evolution of language==
The need to convey information using displacement has been suspected to have been the [[evolutionary pressure]] leading to [[Origin of language|language development in humans]], as outlined by [[Derek Bickerton]] in ''Adam's Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, Derek (2009). ''Adam's Tongue''. Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-2281-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of such need is present in species with a foraging strategy that presents the challenge of directing members of its group to a food source too large to be utilized singly or in small numbers, requiring recruitment of assistance.
{{quote|It's only when you fully appreciate what displacement means, how the absence of displacement is not just a casual feature of ACSs but a crucial defining feature of pre-human minds, that you can start getting the complete picture.| Bickerton, page 217}}
The unique environmental need selecting for a communication system capable for displacement in humans or our direct ancestors is not identified, but hypotheses include Bickerton's theory of small groups finding large herbivore carcasses, and needing the assistance from other small groups of humans to defend against other dangerous scavengers (large cats, hyenas) competing for the same source of food. Language development most certainly did not stop there—since otherwise bees or ants would have comparable communication systems to ours—but this is where it is hypothesized to have begun, giving our ancestors the ability to take communication out of the here and now.

'''Diébédo Francis Kéré''' was born in 1965 in Gando, Burkina Faso and studied at the Technical University of Berlin. Parallel to his studies, he established the [http://www.kere-foundation.com Kéré Foundation e.V.] (formerly Schulbausteine für Gando e.V.), and in 2005 he founded Kéré Architecture. His architectural practice has been recognized nationally and internationally with awards including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004) for his first building, the Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso, and the Global Holcim Award 2012 Gold. Kéré has undertaken projects in varied countries including Burkina Faso, Mali, Germany, the United States, Kenya, and Uganda. In 2017 the Serpentine Galleries commissioned him to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London. He has held professorships at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and the [[Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio|Swiss Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio]]. In 2017 he accepted the professorship for "Architectural Design and Participation" at [[Technical University of Munich|TU München]] (Germany).

== Life ==
Kéré was born in the village of Gando. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, Kéré had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the [[Carl Duisberg#Carl Duisberg Society|Carl Duisberg Society]] to do an apprenticeship in [[Germany]] as a supervisor in [[development aid]]. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], graduating in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-award.org/images/monographs/2009/Diebedo_Francis_Kere/kere_engl.pdf|title=Diébédo Francis Kéré|publisher=Global Award for Sustainable Architecture}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his studies he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and to the community which had supported him, and to give the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré set up the association Schulbausteine für Gando e.V. (now [http://www.kere-foundation.com Kéré Foundation e.V.]), which loosely translates as "Building Blocks for Gando", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from [[Burkina Faso]]. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as his diploma project in 2004, while also opening his own architectural office Kéré Architecture.

== Projects in Gando ==
[[File:Gando village.jpg|inline|right|thumb|Gando village]]

The village of Gando is located south east of [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso’s capital. The 3000 inhabitants live in small mud huts with tin or straw roofs. The huts are gathered in small groups forming communities. The village has no access to running water or electricity, and the [[literacy]] rate remains below the national average of 25%. According to the [[UN Human Development Index]] in 2011, Burkina Faso is the 7th least developed country in the world. Lack of education, low income and life expectancy hold back the country’s development, and most people are [[Subsistence agriculture | subsistence farmers]], remaining dependent on the harsh climate. There is virtually no rain between October and June, and daytime temperatures can easily reach 45&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Gando Primary School ===
[[File:Primary School Gando.jpg|thumb|inline|right|thumb|Kéré Primary School in Gando]]

The first primary school was completed in 2001. Virtually all schools in Burkina Faso are built out of [[concrete]], and look somewhat out of place in the [[Sahel]]. Concrete production is expensive and requires a lot of electricity. Concrete buildings are not well suited to the climate in Burkina Faso, as the interior becomes intolerably hot, making it difficult for pupils to concentrate. Earth is often regarded as a building material for poor people, but Kéré wanted to use locally available resources.

The primary school was built out of [[Mudbrick | mud bricks]], something the community was initially somewhat skeptical about. They were concerned that a mud brick construction would not survive the rain season. But Kéré’s innovative design provided the solution. A wide, raised tin roof protects the walls from the rain, and allows air to circulate underneath in order to keep the building cool. The community was delighted to find the school still standing after ten years, and the building is much cooler and more pleasant to work in than the conventional concrete school buildings. Kéré’s design has become renowned throughout Burkina Faso, and won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture And Polyphony: Building In The Islamic World Today|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|ISBN=978-0-500-28533-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major issues encountered was how to explain plans and designs in a village where most people are illiterate. On drawing a preliminary plan in the sand he found the community fully engaged in the project, many of them coming up with their own suggestions of how to improve it. As Kéré says, “Only those who are involved in the development process can appreciate the results achieved, develop them further and protect them”.

The entire population of Gando took part in the construction of the school. Everybody wanted to help – women prepared the floor while the men pressed earth for the brick walls and collected stones for the foundations. They received on-site training in construction techniques which they could use to build their own houses and to get jobs. Two neighboring villages were impressed by Gando’s community’s organization and achievement. They are now, step by step, building their own school in cooperation with Gando. The value of this project is also recognized by the local authorities: not only are they paying the teachers in the primary school, but they also contribute by employing more and more young people from Gando on their own construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zumtobel-group-award.com/download/zumtobel.pdf#page=38|title=Zumtobel Award Honourable Mentioned Project|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gando School Extension ===
[[File:Kere primary school extension gando.jpg|inline|right|thumb|Kéré Primary School extension in Gando]]

The capacity of the primary school built in 2001 soon became too small to meet the rapidly increasing demands. The building had been designed to accommodate 120 students, but by 2007 the number of pupils had reached 300. Therefore, construction of a new building with four classrooms, a school kitchen, a library and a football pitch began in November 2005. This more than doubled the capacity of the primary school, and approximately 700 pupils attend classes today.

The construction of the school extension was designed to suit the hot climate, and to make use of resources available locally. Every morning for a year, the children of Gando brought a stone to the construction site to provide the material for the foundation, showing them how their personal actions could contribute towards a community project.

As with the primary school, the big overhanging tin roof protects the clay walls from sun and rain. The air between ceiling and roof becomes very hot, causing it to rise, and draw cooler air from beneath. In this way, the combination of solar and thermal energy produce air circulation and a cooling effect for the classrooms. The first primary school used a flat roof which was effective, but required a large amount of steel cladding, making it expensive. Therefore, the primary school extension uses a rounded vault roof, which needs fewer steel supports.

The cooler temperatures create much better working conditions, and considerably influence the pupils’ achievements. Today, they have the best academic results in the region.

=== Gando School Library ===
[[File:Kere library gando.jpg|inline|right|thumb|Kéré's Library in Gando]]
The library completes the school extension in Gando. In a region with a literacy rate well below the national average of 25%, most pupils’ parents are illiterate and they have no books at home. The library enables pupils to widen their horizons and to gain a deeper understanding of their school subjects and the world around them. It is also open to non-students, and is therefore a valuable resource for the entire community.

The eucalyptus facade around the library creates a calm and open space in which pupils can both study and relax. In Burkina Faso, eucalyptus trees are usually used as firewood since they dry out the soil and only creates a small amount of shade. This is the first time in Gando that eucalyptus wood has been used for construction.

The roof’s design also represents a technical innovation: for the first time, traditional clay pots have been cut in half and inserted in the ceiling, letting in light and allowing air to circulate.

=== Gando Teachers' Housing ===
[[File:Kere teachers accommodation.jpg|thumb|Kéré, Teachers' accommodation in Gando]]

The housing situation for the teaching staff in the countryside is an important challenge for the whole country. Teachers often refuse to leave the cities for the countryside, since accommodation is basic and in short supply. Long commutes and bad roads can delay teachers, hampering the education of the pupils. This was a problem for Gando in 2001.

To resolve this problem, teachers’ accommodation was built on the school premises in 2003. The first aim of the teachers’ housing project was to develop an environmentally-friendly and sustainable housing concept, adapted to people’s needs and financial situation. The houses had to offer a reasonable amount of comfort in order to attract teachers, and to give them a pleasant working environment.

The housing concept is based on a simple unit built in the traditional style. It can be constructed as a single unit for one person, or as several units which can be combined for families. From the start, the inhabitants of Gando took an active part in every step of this project: they not only observed but also participated in the development of construction techniques. The construction materials consisted exclusively of local resources in order to allow the villagers to adapt or further develop the houses if they wished to.

Climate is a decisive factor in the methods and materials used. Clay walls and the adobe roof keep the houses cool and regulate the room temperature. This technique works so successfully that the houses have acquired the name “wonderful fridges”, a great compliment for a house in Burkina Faso.

=== Gando Mango Tree Project ===
Kéré's dream is not just to build schools and to provide education, but to create an oasis in which the needs of the villagers of Gando are fulfilled. In order to do this he has embarked on a project of planting mango trees. The project aims to address several major problems in the region.

Starvation is rare, but malnutrition is common in Gando and the surrounding area. The main staple is “[[Fufu | foufou]]”, which consists of pounded and boiled millet. It contains few vitamins, and most people eat just once a day. Mangoes provide an important source of nourishment, and the vitamins help to strengthen the immune system. Furthermore, mango trees provide a vital source of shade. Daytime temperatures often reach 40&amp;nbsp;°C. In the midst of this intolerable heat, the cool space under a mango tree becomes an important meeting place for the village community, where children play, study and rest. A further objective is to teach pupils responsibility. Each pupil is given a tree to look after. In this way they learn how to plant and care for trees, and this is knowledge which they will pass on to their parents and the next generation.

Due to the rapidly expanding population, and the predominance of firewood as the main source of fuel, Burkina Faso has lost 60% of its trees in the last 15 years. This has led to detrimental consequences for the environment. Trees provide shade, protect the soil from erosion, stop desertification and regulate the groundwater regime. In addition to this, trees contribute to soil fertility, and to biodiversity in that they provide a habitat for many species.

With Burkina Faso’s hot and dry climate and the severe shortage of rain between October and June, many plants and saplings can simply not survive. In addition to this many are destroyed by termites. Pesticides and fertilizer are both prohibitively expensive and damaging to the environment. Therefore, Kéré developed an innovative concept:

In preparation for planting the tree a hole is dug and filled with old bones and meat, and left for a few days. After a while, the bones and meat attract ants, which colonize the hole and eat the termites. This enables the trees to grow without needing any insecticide. Animals such as chickens are kept in the shade of the trees, and their dung provides natural fertilizer for the trees, so that artificial fertilizers are not necessary.

Instead of watering the trees twice a day, Kéré came up with the following idea: placing traditional hand-made clay pots next to the trees, with drippers targeted directly to the roots. The clay pots prevent evaporation from taking place and only need to be filled once a week, giving the trees a small but constant supply of water. In this way, a simple yet effective method can make a positive impact on the lives of people in Gando.

=== Gando School Garden and Well ===
Most people in Burkina Faso are subsistence farmers, and in rural villages such as Gando, it is an overwhelming majority. This is a potential problem for education, as families expect their children to help out. It is therefore imperative to give pupils a working knowledge of agriculture, and to make education relevant to them.

To this end, an allotment has been established on the school grounds, and a well has been dug to provide water both for the school and for the village. Alongside their classes, the pupils learn how to take care of the plants without using any pesticides or fertilizers, encouraging them to use sustainable methods in future. In a region where food is scarce and most people have a very repetitive diet, the school garden provides an important contribution to food security.

=== Gando Secondary School ===
[[File:Kere Secondary school Gando.JPG|inline|right|thumb|Kéré Secondary school in Gando]]

An increase in government funding for secondary education in 2010 enabled the 50 pupils to begin classes. While waiting for new classrooms, their lessons have been held in the primary school. Construction of a secondary school began in May 2011, and is due to open in 2013. This is Kéré's biggest project yet.

The new building complex will include 12 classrooms, a school hall, a library, an administrative building and several sports fields. It will accommodate approximately 1000 students. The layout is inspired by the traditional rural households in Burkina Faso: the classrooms are set out in a circular fashion forming a protected courtyard, shielding it from the dust and sand brought by the Harmattan winds. The structure is open on its West side, allowing a cool breeze to enter the area.

The very hot temperatures, large class sizes and lack of air-conditioning in Burkina Faso make it very difficult for pupils to concentrate. Therefore, we developed an innovative air-cooling system only using natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a bank of earth, on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. Perforated pipes are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award Gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/T1499/Awards_Gold_-_Burkina_Faso.htm|title=Global Holcim Awards 2012 Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary school uses the same roof design as the primary school, with a wide corrugated iron roof raised above a clay ceiling. Air circulates between ceiling and roof, heats up and rises, creating a suction current below. This causes the cool air from the under-floor pipes to rise, reducing room temperature by an estimated 6 – 8&amp;nbsp;°C. With simple yet effective methods such as these, the school requires little electricity both in construction and maintenance.

Burkina Faso’s expanding population and the predominant use of firewood as fuel have resulted in major deforestation problems. An estimated 60% of the countries trees have been chopped down in the last 15 years. Worse, reforestation programmes often plant eucalyptus trees which grow easily and quickly, but soak up vast amounts of groundwater at the expense of local agriculture.

In order to combat this problem, the secondary school uses wood from eucalyptus trees for construction, and mango trees are planted in their place. The mango trees need less water, produce fruit and provide more shade than eucalyptus trees, which the pupils make use of during breaks.

As with his other projects, the secondary school uses local manpower for construction. Specialists trained by Francis Kéré supervise members of the local community, training them in the necessary building techniques. Rather than building the walls brick by brick, Kéré has devised a way of pouring mud and a small quantity of cement into a mould, which is much quicker. This skills transfer enables the villagers to replicate the building design, and encourages them to adopt sustainable methods rather than the usual concrete option.

=== Atelier Gando ===
Developed in 2014 and still in construction, the Atelier is a building with function of community center and on-site base for building projects. A group of students from the [[Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio]] helped Francis Kéré plan and build the first steps of the construction.[http://www.tio.ch/News/Partner/767923/Etica-e-poesia-per-un-architettura-sostenibile/]

== Other projects ==

=== Dano Secondary School ===
[[File:Kere Secondary school Dano.jpg|inline|right|thumb|Kéré Secondary school in Dano]]

The secondary school project in Dano was inspired by Kéré's previous work in Gando. The excessive daytime heat was once again the major issue, but this time there were different local resources. Laterite stone, native to the region, was used as the main building material. The building was set at an east-west orientation which reduces direct solar radiation onto the walls, and the sharply protruding roof creates a lot of shade. The building consists of three classrooms, a computer room and an office. There is also an amphitheatre designed for use during break times.

Burkina Faso is ranked the 7th poorest country in the world, nearly all of its energy has to be imported and electricity is scarce and unreliable in supply. It is therefore essential to avoid reliance on electricity, and air conditioning is out of the question. The solution was to use Kéré’s award-winning roof design with its system of natural ventilation. As it gets hot in the classrooms, the heat rises and escapes through vents in the ceiling, and air can circulate between the mud brick ceiling and the raised tin roof.

Finished in 2007, the building work was largely done by people trained in the Gando school projects, giving them the opportunity to use and develop their skills. There was no need to bring a team of architects, engineers and builders from Europe. By training local people, the projects dramatically reduce construction costs, and provide local people with the skills for maintenance and repairs.

=== Centre for Earth Architecture, Mopti ===
[[File:Kere centre earth architecture mopti.JPG|thumb|Kéré Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti, Mali]]

The Aga Khan Trust for Culture has spent over 10 years renovating mosques in Northern [[Mali]]. Finished in 2010, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti is part of this series of projects, following the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The Centre is intended to be much more than an exhibition space: the building is the product of the same ancient building techniques used in the Great Mosques in Mopti, Timbuktu and Djenné. It demonstrates how a material that is a part of the area’s heritage can be used in a modern context. The Centre is made up of an exhibition hall, a community centre, public toilets and a restaurant, responding to the needs of the district management of Komoguel and visitors to the area, as well as the local community.

From the top of the flood barrier you can see that the building is aligned with the mosque. The building has a simple structure and its height corresponds to the neighbouring buildings without compromising the view of the mosque. When viewed from across the lake the Centre manages to maintain a connection with the mosque but does not dominate the view.

The Centre is divided, according to its programme, into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. Clay for the building was brought from 5&amp;nbsp;km away, so that the red colour would contrast with the colour of the local buildings, which are all made using traditional mud construction. The rusty red colour of the laterite clay is due to its high iron oxide content.  All the walls and barrel vaults in the Centre are made out of BTC (compressed earth blocks) and are not plastered or painted. These are very well suited to the climatic conditions as they create a natural temperature buffer, making indoor temperatures much more comfortable. The overhanging roof blocks keep the walls cool and provide shaded outdoor spaces. The building is naturally ventilated through openings in the walls and vaults, therefore mechanical air-conditioning is not needed. Most vernacular buildings in Mopti have wooden ceilings filled with clay. Kéré uses a new system in this building that involves no wood – BTC vaults. He wants to promote the use of clay but to be sparing in his use of wood, as deforestation is a huge environmental issue in Mali.

The landscape project includes wide public spaces and a promenade on the top of the flood barrier. The construction site was backfilled in order to make the lakeside accessible to the public.

=== Opera Village ===
[[File:Kere operndorf 3.jpg|thumb|View of the construction site of the Opera Village]]

When Diébédo Francis Kéré first heard the idea of an opera house for Africa, he thought that it was crazy. But when he met [[Christoph Schlingensief]], the initiator of the project “Opera House for Africa”, he knew that it was no joke. Although Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries on earth, it is also a country with a strong sense of national pride. Burkina Faso is the centre of African film and theatre. Christoph Schlingensief managed to convince Francis Kere that an art project which helps to shape or awaken the cultural identity of a group is important for the development of a country. And if Francis were to construct this building with his methods, integrating local people, using local materials, involving people and taking their concerns into account, then this project would also be right for such a poor country.

Burkina Faso suffered major flooding at the end of August 2009. At the time, Francis was travelling with Thomas George, Christoph’s stage designer, in Burkina, and thus witnessed the floods and the destruction they caused. A few hours after the water had receded, Francis and Thomas tried to look at a site in the capital, Ouagadougou, that Christoph had identified as a possible location for the opera house. However this site, located on the boundary between official and informal settlements, didn’t exist anymore. It had been completely washed away by the floods. The people living there had lost everything within a few hours. After this experience, Francis and Christoph realized that the opera house project should no longer be the main topic of discussion. They began to develop a way to help people rebuild their homes by designing a suitable housing prototype for these people. For Francis as an architect and urban planner, this was an opportunity to develop a module that could be integrated into the project. In this way, the ‘opera village’ project was born out of a catastrophe.

The opera village “Remdoogo” is being constructed on a 12-hectare site on a little rise in Laongo, one hour’s drive from the capital of Burkina Faso and overlooking the West African landscape of the Sahel zone. A festival theatre, workshops, medical centre and guest houses are planned, as well as solar panels, a well and a school for up to 500 children and teenagers with music and film classes. Central to the project is the festival hall with the theatre inside. The stage and auditorium were designed and constructed for a piece of theatre in Germany and not used again afterwards. Now they are going to be transformed in Burkina Faso to meet the needs of the Opera village.

The support construction of the stand and the rotating stage will be maintained. The seat rows and interior walls will be covered with Burkinabe fabrics. The theatre will be completely enclosed by a 15&amp;nbsp;m high covering to shelter it from the outside conditions.

Simple basic modules, which vary in quality and function depending on the equipment they house, comprise the entire village. Local people will be employed to build the modules, and local materials such as clay, laterite, cement bricks, gum wood and loam rendering will be used for construction. For reinforcing elements such as beams, columns, ring-beams and foundations, concrete will be used. Due to the massive walls and large overhang of the roofs, air conditioning could be discounted in most buildings.

The theatre hall should be a place of encounter and exchange for people of different cultural and family backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspekte.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/12/0,1872,8015052,00.html |title=Von Afrika lernen, was wir nicht mehr können|publisher=ZDF Aspekte|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Park of Mali, Bamako ===
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Mali, the National Park in [[Bamako]] was renovated, gaining a new restaurant, a sports centre and several entrance buildings.

The restaurant is situated on top of a rock formation and is arranged around the different height levels. From this height, the restaurant has views over the National Park and a nearby lake. The building is divided into four sections, each with a different function.

The sports centre uses the same architectural concept as the restaurant. It consists of three pavilions which are arranged around an elliptical playground. The buildings are arranged to produce as much shade as possible both in the playground and the interior recreational areas. The relationship between interior and exterior spaces played a major role in the design.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

All the buildings are clad with local natural stone, which reinforces the local identity and saves building costs. The exterior stone walls create isolated interior spaces and regulate interior temperature. The large overhanging roofs provide shade and create a more comfortable inside climate. In certain rooms, such as the dining hall in the restaurant, air-conditioning is used and the gap between the wall and the roof is closed. The project was completed in 2010.

=== Zhou Shan Harbour Development, China ===
The archipelago of Zhou Shan in [[China]] is the site of an experimental urban rehabilitation project, led by the Chinese architect Wang Shu. Zhou Shan is the Chinese capital of fishing, as it is situated at the entrance of the delta of the Yang Tsé, and has a population of around one million. The aim of this project, started in 2009, is to transform the industrial harbour area, Putuo, into a touristic and cultural district.  The harbour will remain operational and the architecture will maintain a dialogue between modernity and the area’s history and heritage.

The site is on an island about 300 metres from the mainland.  The chosen plot of land contains a dense assortment of buildings, docks and warehouses, built over several decades. The landscape of the site is very diverse; to the south lies steep mountainous hillside, while the northern part of the site is characterised by rivers running through it. The mountain, the sea, the city and the hundreds of boats form a striking backdrop for the site. At night the skyline of the city is illuminated and the mountain glows above the water of the fishery.

Diébédo Francis Kéré has designed an exhibition gallery, an information centre, artists’ studios and a “cultural creativity garden” for the area. The scheme is designed around a platform that extends across the site all the way to the mountain, which borders the site to the west. This will serve as a space of transition between the man-made environment of the developed district and the natural environment beyond. The platform also turns a previously open road into a tunnel and therefore creates more space for new constructions.

The building below the platform used to be an ice factory. Kéré Architecture will make use of the existing water reservoir on top of this building by transforming it into a garden with plants growing around the water. Visitors to the three Chinese tea houses within the garden will benefit from the pleasant air quality and beautiful views of the mountain and the site.

Two new buildings on top of the platform provide the space required for the exhibition and the art gallery. The first building is situated at the end of the platform close to the mountain, establishing an interaction between architecture and nature. The second one, identical in shape and size, stands perpendicular to the first. The exhibition space can either operate independently or in conjunction with the artists’ studios. Together with the three boxes of the Tea House this ensemble defines an open yard on the platform.

Additionally the roof section of the old factory has been cut into halves, allowing a walk through it. Daylight can travel as far as the ground floor. Inside and outside are linked visually, as the series of individual buildings opens up a variety of views, inviting visitors to walk through and to discover the diversity of the works in the Creativity Garden. A generous open air flight of stairs guides visitors to the top of the platform; it presents a pleasant opportunity to sit and rest in summertime.

The materials used and the ventilation system are simple and low-tech. Concrete is used as a basic construction material due to its resistance to humidity. The main structure of the factory will be removed and restored.

The best possible level of transparency is achieved by means of floor-to-ceiling glass elements. Sunlight gets into the rooms and there are unlimited views over the entire site. The southern and eastern facades are particularly exposed to the sun in summertime. Bamboo poles serve as exterior shades characterised by their natural irregular structure. The northern and western facades facing the mountains and harbour will remain free of extra layers. Wood panels alternate with glass elements, thus the needs for both transparency and solar protection are met.

To prevent overheating in summertime, air is allowed to move through the interstitial space between the facade layers. The open arrangement of the buildings supports this method of ventilation.

=== Medical Centre, Léo ===
In 2012, Kéré Architecture embarked on a new project to build a medical centre in Léo. Léo is a town in Sissili Province in Burkina Faso situated near the border with Ghana, around 150 kilometres south of the capital city, Ouagadougou. The population of Léo is 50,000, but the medical centre will also serve the villages in the surrounding countryside. A high staff turnover rate and lack of smaller, local clinics means that the district hospital is often overstretched and struggles to serve the whole community. The charity “Operieren in Afrika” decided to raise funds to build a medical clinic in Léo for small, simple operations. They will provide scholarships to trained doctors and nurses to staff the clinic, which will maintain a connection with Germany.

As the project has limited funding, Kéré Architecture used pre-planned modules as the basis for the project. As in the Gando secondary school, the walls will be constructed from cast earth, and the roofs will be tin. The modules are arranged so that their roofs overlap, in order to provide more shade. In the final phase of the design, the space between the modules has become interior space. The “corridor” of space between the rows of modules is a wide, open circulation space, with benches for people to relax on and trees for shade.

=== International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, Geneva ===
The new permanent exhibition space at the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum]], which opened in 2012, has been designed by three internationally renowned designers with different cultural backgrounds. Each architect has worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) has worked on the theme of “defending human dignity”, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) on “refusing fatality” and Diébédo Francis Kéré on “reconstructing the family link”.

The dark entrance passage, bounded by hemp concrete walls, encourages the visitor to consider the frightened and suffocating emotions of family tragedy during conflict. Central to this part of the exhibition is a tower, also made of hemp concrete, which is an architectural reference to a traditional hut for a nuclear family. It lets in very little light and has a Corten steel floor with a rusty appearance. This space is a memorial to tragedies such as the Srebrenica genocide.

The “Tree of Messages”, with its metal branches, is a reminder of the cold contrast between nature and war. The connection between nature and the family is an important sub-theme in Kéré’s part of the exhibition.  The “Room of Witnesses” is a direct contrast to the tower as here the focus is on transparency and hope rather than darkness and despair. This space emphasizes the important role eyewitness testimony plays in humanitarian action.

The use of simple materials here is to emphasize the fundamental connection between the family, roots and nature, and thus the great importance of the difficult search for the missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''First Things First''' manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by [[Ken Garland]]. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of [[Tony Benn]], radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by [[critical theory]], the [[Frankfurt School]] and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a [[Humanism|Humanist]] dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]].

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

The term "geopiety" comes from a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''geo'', for earth, and the [[Latin language|Latin]] root "[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]". As Wright explained when coining the term, geopiety is meant to refer to "emotional piety aroused by awareness of terrestrial diversity of the kind of which geography is also a form of awareness".&lt;ref name=w251&gt;Wright, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of geopiety can be found in the works of American preacher [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]:
{{quote|He that is traveling up a very high mountain, if he goes on climbing, will at length get to that height and eminence as at last not only to have his prospect vastly large, but he will get above clouds and winds, and where he will enjoy a perpetual serenity and calm. This may encourage Christians constantly and steadfastly to climb the Christian hill.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

That high towers or other high places are commonly smitten with thunder, and mountainous places more subject to terrible thunder and lightning, shows how that pride and self-exaltation does particularly excite God's wrath.&lt;ref name=w251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baron '''Karl Eduard von Liphart''' or '''Carl Eduard von Liphart''' (16 May 1808 – 15 February 1891) was a noted art expert&lt;ref&gt;"An acute connoisseur" according to the seminal art historians [[Joseph Archer Crowe|Crowe]] and [[Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle|Cavalcaselle]] in ''Raphael: his life and works'', 1885:322 note.&lt;/ref&gt; and collector from Estonia. The family manor was near Dorpat (now [[Tartu]]).

==Life==
Liphart was born in [[Kambja Parish]] in [[Tartu County]] in 1808. He was one of the three children of [[Carl Gotthard von Lindhardt]] and Annette von Loewenwolde. He came from a noble family based at [[Raadi Manor]] who were members of the Estonian intelligentsia and owned a significant art collection.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/en/visit/raadi/history-of-manor History of Manor], Eesti. Rahva Muuseum, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Liphart's father maintained his own string quartet led by [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]],  a gifted violinist and composer; David  left in 1836 to work in Leipzig  with his friend [[Mendelssohn]], but later returned to marry Liphart's sister Sophie.&lt;ref name=silvela&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvela|first=Zdenko|title=A new history of violin playing : the vibrato and Lambert Massart's revolutionary discovery|year=2001|publisher=Universal Publishers|location=US|isbn=1581126670|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1581126670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 Liphart was the founding President of the [[Estonian Naturalists' Society]]. The society still operates (2013) and claims to be the oldest scientific society in the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elus.edicypages.com/about-ens/history History], Estonian Naturalists Society, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 Liphart moved to Florence because of the poor health of his son, [[Ernst Friedrich von Liphart|Ernst]]. However, in Florence he was able to add to his expertise and to amass a collection of paintings. He was financed and supported by Grand Duchess [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Maria Nikolaevna]], the daughter of [[Tsar Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=reh/&gt; The bas-relief of St Jerome by [[Desiderio da Settignano]] now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, was purchased in Florence by an agent of Maria Nikolaevna as a gift for Baron Liphart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1252.html National Gallery: ''Sr Jerome in the Desert'', Desiderio da Settignano, c 1461].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione angel crop.jpeg|left|thumb|The angel from [[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''Annunciation'']]]]
Liphart became an acknowledged expert on the history of art. In 1867, following a theory put forward by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Gustav Waagen]], Liphart was able to recognise that a [[Annunciation (Leonardo)|painting of the Annunciation]] newly arrived in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] was by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=David Alan|title=Leonardo da Vinci : origins of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300072465|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0300072465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he realised that another painting in the Uffizi was by the seventeenth century artist [[Hercules Seghers]]. It was Liphart and his friend the Director of the [[Berlin State Museums]], [[Wilhelm von Bode]], who independently established that this artist was more than just an etcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/liphartk.htm Liphart, Karl Eduard Baron von, also Carl], Dictionary of Art Historians, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Florence]] in 1891. After his death his art collection was moved to Estonia where it was combined with his family's collection at [[Raadi Manor]].&lt;ref name=reh&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/printimage.html?image_no=28 The Environs of Plymouth], rehs.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Liphart wrote numerous articles and published brief notes, but never published a book-length monograph.  He corresponded with all the major art historians of his time, in Europe, Great Britain and the United States.{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}

Liphart's son, [[Ernst Friedrich von Liphart]], was disinherited by his father in 1873 for converting to marry a Roman Catholic. However his son was an accomplished artist, painting portraits including one of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]. He went on to be a curator of the Hermitage Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/baron-ernst-friedrich-von-liphart Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart], RusArtNet.com, retrieved 30 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The art collection==
The graphic art that was collected by the Liphart family came into the possession of [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s. The university still conserves the collection which includes examples of Japanese art as well as noted European printmakers like [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html Graphic Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101050527/http://kunstimuuseum.ut.ee/eng/graphic.html |date=1 January 2014 }}, University of Tartu Art Museum, retrieved 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[public policy]], '''outrage factor''' is public opposition to a policy that is not based on the knowledge of the technical details. The term "outrage factor" originates from Peter Sandman's 1993 book, ''Responding to Community Outrage: Strategies for Effective Risk Communication''.&lt;ref name="nebel"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Nebel|first=Bernard J.|author2=Richard T. Wright |title=Environmental science: the way the world works  |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|year=1993 |edition=4th|pages=392–3|isbn=0-13-285446-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wjxeUeaRnMC&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA393#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hird"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Hird |first=John A. |title=Superfund: the political economy of environmental risk |publisher=JHU Press|year=1994 |page=70|isbn=0-8018-4807-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsTBXJPVmzgC&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Outrage factors" are the emotional factors that influence perception of risk. The risks that are considered involuntary, industrial and unfair are often given more weight than factors that are thought of as voluntary, natural and fair.

Sandman gives the formula:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{{quote|Risk {{=}} Hazard + Outrage}}

== Risk communications ==
While [[policy analysis]] by institutional [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholder]]s typically focuses on [[risk-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-benefit analysis]], popular [[risk perception]] is not informed by the same concerns. The successful implementation of a policy relying on public support and cooperation must address the outrage factor when informing the public about the policy.

In an interview with ''[[New York Times]]'' [[journalist]] and [[Freakonomics]] author [[Stephen J. Dubner]], Sandman emphasized "the most important truth in risk communication is the exceedingly low correlation between whether a risk is dangerous, and whether it's upsetting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/29/risk-hazard-outrage-a-conversation-with-risk-consultant-peter-sandman/
|title=Risk = Hazard + Outrage: A Conversation with Risk Consultant Peter Sandman
|author=[[Stephen J. Dubner]]
|date=2011-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of public outrage has been acknowledged in discussions of various policy debates, including [[nuclear safety]],&lt;ref&gt;

The Venus flytrap is a [[carnivorous plant]] that catches its prey with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if a second contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.

The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;&lt;ref name="PRS"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter H.|last1=Raven|first2=Ray Franklin|last2= Evert |first3=Susan E.|last3=Eichhorn|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th |publisher= W.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6350">A '''pocket neighborhood''' is a type of planned community that consists of a grouping of smaller residences, often around a [[courtyard]] or common garden, designed to promote a close knit sense of [[community]] and neighborliness with an increased level of contact.&lt;ref name=Builder&gt;Home Builder Network. ''Builder'', September 2005. [http://www.hbrnetwork.com/articles/sales/pocket-change.aspx "Pocket Change"]. Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations involved in planning and [[zoning]] pocket neighborhoods include reducing or segregating parking and roadways, the use of shared communal areas that promote social activities, and homes with smaller square footage built in close proximity to one another (high density). Features in the smaller homes are designed to maximize space and can use built in shelves and porch areas, encouraging time spent outside with a focal point around a [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] (instead of parking areas).&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt;

[[Environmentalism|Environmental considerations]] often play a role in the planning of pocket neighborhoods, and those advocating them promote their design as an alternative to the [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]], isolation, expense, and commuter and automobile focus of many larger homes in [[suburbia|suburban developments]].

== Origins ==
The term "pocket neighborhood" was coined by architect Ross Chapin.&lt;ref name="pocket_neighborhoods"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pocket neighborhoods (Open Library)|url = https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16113705W/Pocket_neighborhoods|website = openlibrary.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09|last = OpenLibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Chapin partnered with The Cottage Company founder Jim Soules to build the first contemporary pocket neighborhood, the Third Street Cottages, in the city of [[Langley, Washington|Langley]] on [[Whidbey Island]] in [[Puget Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/01/pocket-neighborhoods-suburbs-sustainable/864/ | title='Pocket Neighborhoods' For Sustainable Suburbs | publisher=The Atlantic Cities | date=Jan 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 30, 2012 | author=Benfield, Kaid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Street Cottages, a collection of 8 modest {{convert|650|-|1600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} cottages,&lt;ref name="good life"&gt;Lisa Selin Davis The Good Life; pride of place April 2008 page 17-22 ''Cottage Living''&lt;/ref&gt; were developed to take advantage of Langley's cottage ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/planning/cottagehousing.aspx | title=Langley Municipal Code Ch. 18.22.180 - Cottage Housing | publisher=The Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington | accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where zoning allowed for double density housing "if the homes were limited to 975 square feet".&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt;

Soules describes a pocket neighborhood as "a group of homes that face and relate to one another around a landscaped common area—the old [[bungalow court]] approach." Chapin also credits [[Radburn design housing]], architect Bernard Maybeck's Rose Walk in the [[Berkeley Hills]], and early 20th century cottage courts such as [[Seattle|Seattle's]] Pine Street Cottages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are small cottages the next big thing in housing?|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Are-small-cottages-the-next-big-thing-in-housing-1280757.php|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as influences on the pocket neighborhood plan.&lt;ref name="pocket_neighborhoods"/&gt; Pocket neighborhoods often adopt a model of cooperative ownership and shared community responsibilities similar to [[Cohousing|cohousing communities]].

{{political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology}}
'''Political anthropology''' concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. 

==History of political anthropology==
===Origins===
Political anthropology has its roots in the 19th century. At that time, thinkers such as [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and [[Sir Henry Maine]] tried to trace the evolution of human society from 'primitive' or 'savage' societies to more 'advanced' ones. These early approaches were ethnocentric, speculative, and often racist. Nevertheless, they laid the basis for political anthropology by undertaking a modern study inspired by modern science, and in particular Darwin. In a move that would be influential for future anthropology, they focused on [[kinship]] as the key to understanding political organization, and emphasized the role of the 'gens' or lineage as an object of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewellen|first=Ted|title=Political Anthropology: An Introduction|year=1983|publisher=Bergin and Garvey|location=Boston, MA|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political anthropology can be traced back to the 1940 publication ''[[African Political Systems]]'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] and [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]. They rejected the speculative historical reconstruction of earlier authors and argued that "a scientific study of political institutions must be inductive and comparative and aim solely at establishing and explaining the uniformities found among them and their interdependencies with other features of social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortes|first=Meyer|title=African Political Systems|year=1940|publisher=Keegan Paul International|location=London|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]: to classify societies into a small number of discrete categories, and then compare them in order to make generalizations about them. The contributors of this book were influenced by [[Radcliffe-Brown]] and [[structural functionalism]]. As a result, they assumed that all societies were well-defined entities which sought to maintain their equilibrium and social order. Although the authors recognized that "Most of these societies have been conquered or have submitted to European rule from fear of invasion. They would not acquiesce in it if the threat of force were withdrawn; and this fact determines the part now played in their political life by European administration"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortes|year=1940|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors in the volume tended in practice to examine African political systems in terms of their own internal structures, and ignored the broader historical and political context of colonialism.

Several authors reacted to this early work. In his work ''Political Systems of Highland Burma'' (1954) [[Edmund Leach]] argued that it was necessary to understand how societies changed through time rather than remaining static and in equilibrium. A special version of conflict oriented political anthropology was developed in the so-called ‘Manchester school’, started by [[Max Gluckman]]. Gluckman focused on social process and an analysis of structures and systems based on their relative stability. In his view, conflict maintained the stability of political systems through the establishment and re-establishment of crosscutting ties among social actors. Gluckman even suggested that a certain degree of conflict was necessary to uphold society, and that conflict was constitutive of social and political order.

By the 1960s this transition work developed into a full-fledged subdiscipline which was canonized in volumes such as ''Political Anthropology'' (1966) edited by [[Victor Turner]] and [[Marc Swartz]]. By the late 1960s, political anthropology was a flourishing subfield: in 1969 there were two hundred anthropologists listing the subdicipline as one of their areas of interests, and a quarter of all British anthropologists listed politics as a topic that they studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Joan|title=Anthropology and Politics|year=1990|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political anthropology developed in a very different way in the United States. There, authors such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of Morgan, and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

From the 1960s a ‘process approach’ developed, stressing the role of agents (Bailey 1969; Barth 1969). It was a meaningful development as anthropologists started to work in situations where the colonial system was dismantling. The focus on conflict and social reproduction was carried over into Marxist approaches that came to dominate French political anthropology from the 1960s. [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s work on the Kabyle (1977) was strongly inspired by this development, and his early work was a marriage between French post-structuralism, Marxism and process approach.

Interest in anthropology grew in the 1970s. A session on anthropology was organized at the Ninth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in 1973, the proceedings of which were eventually published in 1979 as ''Political Anthropology: The State of the Art''. A newsletter was created shortly thereafter, which developed over time into the journal ''[http://polarjournal.org/ PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review]''.

===Anthropology as a discipline concerned with states and their institutions===
While for a whole century (1860 to 1960 roughly) political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more “complex” social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. This was not the result of a sudden development or any sudden “discovery” of contextuality. From the 1950s anthropologists who studied peasant societies in Latin America and Asia, had increasingly started to incorporate their local setting (the village) into its larger context, as in Redfield’s famous distinction between ‘small’ and ‘big’ traditions (Redfield 1941). The 1970s also witnessed the emergence of Europe as a category of anthropological investigation. Boissevain’s essay, “towards an anthropology of Europe” (Boissevain and Friedl 1975) was perhaps the first systematic attempt to launch a comparative study of cultural forms in Europe; an anthropology not only carried out in Europe, but an anthropology of Europe.

The turn toward the study of complex society made anthropology inherently more political. First, it was no longer possible to carry out fieldwork in say, Spain, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Algeria or India without taking into account the way in which all aspects of local society were tied to state and market. It is true that early ethnographies in Europe had sometimes done just that: carried out fieldwork in villages of Southern Europe, as if they were isolated units or ‘islands’. However, from the 1970s that tendency was openly criticised, and Jeremy Boissevain (Boissevain and Friedl 1975) said it most clearly: anthropologists had “tribalised Europe” and if they wanted to produce relevant ethnography they could no longer afford to do so. Contrary to what is often heard from colleagues in the political and social sciences, anthropologists have for nearly half a century been very careful to link their ethnographic focus to wider social, economic and political structures. This does not mean to abandon an ethnographic focus on very local phenomena, the care for detail.

In a more direct way, the turn towards complex society also signified that political themes increasingly were taken up as the main focus of study, and at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz’s comparative work on the Balinese state is an early, famous example. There is today a rich canon of anthropological studies of the state (see for example Abeles 1990). Hastings Donnan, Thomas Wilson and others started in the early 1990s a productive subfield, an “anthropology of borders”, which addresses the ways in which state borders affect local populations, and how people from border areas shape and direct state discourse and state formation (see for example Alvarez, 1996; Thomassen, 1996; Vereni, 1996; Donnan and Wilson, 1994; 1999; 2003).

From the 1980s a heavy focus on ethnicity and nationalism developed. ‘Identity’ and ‘identity politics’ soon became defining themes of the discipline, partially replacing earlier focus on kinship and social organization. This made anthropology even more obviously political. Nationalism is to some extent simply state-produced culture, and to be studied as such. And ethnicity is to some extent simply the political organization of cultural difference (Barth 1969). Benedict Anderson’s book ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' discusses why nationalism came into being. He sees the invention of the printing press as the main spark, enabling shared national emotions, characteristics, events and history to be imagined through common readership of newspapers.

The interest in cultural/political identity construction also went beyond the nation-state dimension. By now, several ethnographies have been carried out in the international organizations (like the EU) studying the ''fonctionnaires'' as a cultural group with special codes of conduct, dressing, interaction etc. (Abélès, 1992; Wright, 1994; Bellier, 1995; Zabusky, 1995; MacDonald, 1996; Rhodes, ‘t Hart, and Noordegraaf, 2007). Increasingly, anthropological fieldwork is today carried out inside bureaucratic structures or in companies. And bureaucracy can in fact only be studied by living in it – it is far from the rational system we and the practitioners like to think, as Weber himself had indeed pointed out long ago (Herzfeld 1992&lt;ref&gt;Herzfeld is also one of the few anthropologists who has analysed political elections. This is still a relatively neglected field of enquiry, despite the evident fact that it is exactly during election campaigns that alliances and local strategies of power come to the fore (see for example Spencer 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;).

The concern with political institutions has also fostered a focus on institutionally driven political agency. There is now an anthropology of policy making (Shore and Wright 1997). This focus has been most evident in [[Development anthropology]] or the [[anthropology of development]], which over the last decades has established as one of the discipline’s largest subfields. Political actors like states, governmental institutions, NGOs, International Organizations or business corporations are here the primary subjects of analysis. In their ethnographic work anthropologists have cast a critical eye on discourses and practices produced by institutional agents of development in their encounter with ‘local culture’ (see for example Ferguson 1994). Development anthropology is tied to global [[Political Economy in anthropology|political economy]] and [[economic anthropology]] as it concerns the management and redistribution of both ideational and real resources (see for example Hart 1982). In this vein, Escobar (1995) famously argued that international development largely helped to reproduce the former colonial power structures.

Many other themes have over the last two decades been opened up which, taken together, are making anthropology increasingly political: [[post-colonialism]], post-communism, gender, multiculturalism, migration, not to forget the umbrella term of globalization. It thus makes sense to say that while anthropology was always to some extent about politics, this is even more evidently the case today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23370">'''Public interest law''' loosely, refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor or marginalized people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms ([[pro bono|''pro bono publico'']]). In general terms it means a legal action initiated in the court of law for the protection of Public Interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/nature-and-importance-of-public.html Nature and Importance of Public Interest Litigation], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under-represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Christine M.

==Central and Eastern Europe ==
At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the [[Council of Europe]], with its [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Rekosh&gt;Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.&amp; For. Aff.55, 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of [[impact litigation]], test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about "strategic litigation" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider.

The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance.&lt;ref name=Rekosh /&gt;
== Italy ==
The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both "caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law-makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)"&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.nomos-leattualitaneldiritto.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/maestri-2.pdf Gabriele Maestri, ''ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017'', Nomos, n. 2/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;, all of them brought [[pro bono]].

==China==
Public interest law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in “making law.”  Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China’s Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Draft limits scale of class-action lawsuits|work= [[China Daily]]|date= April 24, 2012|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/25/content_15131945.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Public interest law in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2004/27.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(Society%20for%20Protection%20of%20the%20Harbour%20Ltd%20and%20Town%20Planning%20Board) Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board] [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/757.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Clean%20Air%20Foundation%20Ltd Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR] [2007] HKEC 1356.&lt;/ref&gt; and minority rights&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/39.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(W%20and%20Registrar%20of%20Marriages) W v Registrar of Marriages] [2013] HKCFA 39; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/17.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Vallejos%20Evangeline%20Banao Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration &amp; Anor] [2013] HKCFA 17.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most litigated areas.

One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Geoffrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries ''"Pam Baker"''], ''"[[The Guardian]]"'', Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk|title=基本法第廿三條|website=www.hkhrm.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of [[Cause lawyering | cause lawyers]] who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[Legal Aid Department]] provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lad.gov.hk/eng/las/overview.html|title=Legal Aid Department - Legal Aid Schemes - Overview|website=www.lad.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.&lt;ref name="karen"&gt;Kong, Karen. "Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?" 39 HKLJ 767, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.

Apart from legal aid, the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]] jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/duty/duty.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Duty Lawyer Scheme : The Duty Lawyer Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/free/free.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Free Legal Advice Scheme : Free Legal Advice Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ archived] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073406/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Free Legal Consultation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosehklawyer.org/en/search_fl_start.asp|title=ChooseHKLawyer|website=www.choosehklawyer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.&lt;ref name="chung"&gt;Chung, Eugenie.

In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.&lt;ref&gt;Precht, Robert. [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1310978/more-public-interest-lawyers-can-help-ease-hong-kongs-social "More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong.

Law schools in Hong Kong also organize various programs to promote the idea of ''pro bono'' legal service to students.&lt;ref name="hkuscheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ke.hku.hk/eng/highlights/2010/legal|title=KE Spotlight - Community Engagement - HKU Knowledge Exchange|website=www.ke.hku.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer Brown LLP, [http://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/d3066e31-ce28-4bef-8230-0ae6dc5897d2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/575b4443-1989-4db6-be21-19736d732225/ProBonoUpdate_042010.pdf "Pro Bono Update" (Spring 2010)], page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice [[V. R. Krishna Iyer]] along with Justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]]. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post.

[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]] (center) in his office 1916.]]

“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists"] (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work—wishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: "Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States(USA). Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing [[legal aid]] free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=How Americans Lost the Right to Counsel, 50 Years After 'Gideon' (March, 2013)|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-americans-lost-right-counsel-50-years-after-gideon|publisher=The Brennan Center for Justice (NYU School of Law)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering perfunctory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen B.|last2=Sanneh|first2=Sia M.|title=Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After Gideon v.

==United Kingdom(UK)==
In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some [[libel]] suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance [[freedom of information]] laws in the UK). Also, judges in [[common law]] systems can make judgements on the grounds of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], a related term.

'''Ronald Brunlees McKerrow''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (12 December 1872 – 20 January 1940) was one of the leading bibliographers and Shakespeare scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McKitterick, 'Introduction', in: ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'' (1927, reprint 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
R. B. McKerrow was born in [[Putney]], son of [[Alexander McKerrow]], a civil engineer, and Mary Jane Brunlees, daughter of [[James Brunlees|Sir James Brunlees]], a president of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; His paternal grandfather was [[William McKerrow]], a noted cleric in the [[Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 17 - Malawi: Libraries in to Metropolitan Reference and Research Library Agency (METRO) |first1=Allen |last1=Kent |first2=Harold |last2=Lancour |first3=Jay E. |last3=Daily |page=321 |publisher=CRC Press |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-82472-017-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PSpemHkShCQC&amp;pg=PA321}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Picket Piece]] ([[Wendover]], Buckinghamshire) where he was buried.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;W. W. Greg, 'McKerrow, Ronald Brunlees (1872–1940)', rev. John V. Richardson Jr., ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34758, accessed 14 Sept 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], at [[King's College, London]], and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MKRW894RB|name=Mckerrow, Ronald Brunlees}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught English for three years in Tokyo (1897&amp;ndash;1900), where he learnt Japanese. 
Following his return to London, he became a director of the publishing house [[Sidgwick and Jackson]] (1908).&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;G.B. Harrison, ''Review of English Studies'', xvi, no. 63, July 1940, pp. 257&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of Cambridge in 1911. In 1912 he became joint Honorary Secretary of the [[Bibliographical Society]] (with [[A. W. Pollard]]).  The Society became the focus for much of his intellectual activity.

During the First World War he taught in the English Department at [[King's College, London]] (until 1919).
He founded the [[The Review of English Studies|''Review of English Studies'']] in 1925 and remained its editor until his death.
He also edited the Bibliographical Society's journal ''The Library'' from 1934 to 1937.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

McKerrow received an honorary doctorate from [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Louvain University]] in 1927 and was the Sandars Reader in Bibliography at Cambridge University in 1928. The following year he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Bibliographical Society. In 1932 he became a fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

His papers are preserved in the Library of [[Trinity College (Cambridge)|Trinity College]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0016%2FRBMK Cambridge University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{Wikisource author}}
McKerrow's work had three main focuses: 
* the textual study of early English Drama, especially the works of [[Thomas Nash]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; he was one of the founder members of the [[Malone Society]].
* the history of the English book trade in the early-modern period; he made three substantial contributions in this field: ''Printers' and Publishers' Devices in England and Scotland, 1485&amp;ndash;1640'' (1913), ''Title-Page Borders used in England and Scotland, 1485&amp;ndash;1640'' (with [[Frederic Sutherland Ferguson|F. S. Ferguson]]) (1932), and under his general editorship the volume for 1557&amp;ndash;1640 in the Bibliographical Society's  ''Dictionaries of the printers and booksellers who were at work in England, Scotland and Ireland, 1557&amp;ndash;1775'' (1910).[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001757519]
* the theory and practice of historical and textual bibliography: firstly, his major edition of the works of Thomas Nash (1904); his ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'' (1927) which remains a standard work (supplemented now by [[Philip Gaskell]]'s ''New Introduction to Bibliography'', 1972); and the ''Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare'' (1939) which was intended to be the introduction for a full scientific critical edition of Shakespeare which was unfinished at his death.

With [[A. W. Pollard]] and [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]], R. B. McKerrow was one of the three great figures of English bibliography of the first half of the twentieth century.

[[File:Statsraad Lehmkuhl2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Built in 1914 as [[Grossherzog Friedrich August]], a school training ship for the German merchant marine, the since 1921 Norwegian-owned [[Statsraad Lehmkuhl]] is one of the oldest sail training ships in service]]
From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when [[maritime nation]]s would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see [[Outward Bound]]), '''sail training''' provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water. 

== Background ==
By 1900 most commercial sailing vessels were struggling to turn a profit in the face of competition from more modern [[Steamboat|steam ships]] which had become efficient enough to steam shorter [[great circle]] routes between ports instead of the longer [[trade wind]] routes used by [[sailing ships]].

Ships were built larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were simplified to reduce manning costs and speed was no longer a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their date of arrival (which steam ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the [[Panama Canal]] was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate: principally on 
*the [[Chile]]an [[nitrate trade]] (for fertilizers and explosive production in Europe), and on
*the Australian [[grain trade]].
Both Chile and Australian ports were difficult to supply with coal for steamships to refuel. Also, both routes to Europe went round [[Cape Horn]].

The end of the First World War saw a brief return to profitability as all ship types were in scarce supply due to wartime losses but that boom became bust as many new [[steam ships]] were built to replace the sailing ships that were lost.

== Genesis in the 1930s ==
[[File:Amerigo vespucci 1976 nyc aufgetakelt.jpg|thumbnail|[[Italian navy]] training ship ''[[Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci|Amerigo Vespucci]]'', launched in 1931.]]

While many countries of the world operated sailing ships as [[school ship|training vessels]] for officers in their [[Merchant marine|Merchant Marine]] in the 1920s and 30s, several sailing ship owners such as [[Carl Laeisz]] and [[Gustaf Erikson]] determined that there was still a profit to be made from the last of the sailing ships.  

Erikson purchased existing ships that required the minimum of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] investment and repaired them with parts cannibalised from other ships. Identifying the bulk cargo routes that would still offer paying freights, he manned the ships with a smattering of paid experienced officers.  

Some of the deckhands were [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]] from steamship lines and other adventurous youth who had paid a premium to sail while being trained, some recruited for very modest salaries. The apprentices were considered trainees and were the first formalization of sail trainers with crew drawn from members of the public who just went for the adventure, as opposed to a career.  

With manning costs netted out on Erikson's balance sheet, the ships continued to return a paper [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. However Erikson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the [[depreciation]] on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] and [[Rigging|rigs]]. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after World War II. While the shipping companies of Erickson and [[F. Laeisz]] gradually turned to [[steam engine|steam]], the next generation of captains were climbing up the [[hawsehole]] and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo.

From 1932 through 1958, [[Irving Johnson]] and his wife [[Electa Johnson|Electa "Exy" Johnson]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world 7 times with amateur youth crews on board their vessels named ''Yankee''. Over the years, their voyages were featured in books they authored, and in [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] magazines and TV specials like ''"Irving Johnson, High Seas Adventurer"''. Their archives are at [[Mystic Seaport]], Connecticut.  

Australian [[Alan Villiers]] purchased the old school ship ''George Stage'' from Denmark in 1934.  Renaming her the ''[[Joseph Conrad (ship)|Joseph Conrad]]'', he sailed her round the world with no paying cargo and a crew of youth who had paid to be there.  He also took as many non-paying youth as he could afford to fit in the budget, those he considered at risk on the streets of their inner cities and in need of what was then called "character building".  These trips were the genesis of current modern sail training, using manually operated ships and the harsh discipline imposed by the sea to further personal development and taking those disadvantaged by circumstance to benefit from the experience.&lt;ref name="King1988"&gt;{{cite book

By the end of World War II, the numbers of traditionally rigged sailing ships left were dwindling and public interest waned. After the German school ship [[Niobe (schooner)|Niobe]] had sunk in 1932, killing 69, the loss of the ''[[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]'' in 1957 and the ''[[Albatross (ship, built in 1920)|Albatross]]'' in 1961 drew further ill will and seemed to signal the end of an era.&lt;ref name="Parrott2004"&gt;{{cite book

== Modern sail training ==
[[File:Downhaul.jpg|thumb|Cadets man headsails sheets on the ''[[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|Eagle]]'']]
In what was conceived to be last great gathering of [[Square rig|square-riggers]] under sail, Bernard Morgan and Greville Howard persuaded a number of ship owners to join together in a sort of farewell salute in 1956, organizing a race from [[Torbay]] on the South Coast of England to race informally across the [[Bay of Biscay]] to [[Lisbon]] in [[Portugal]].  Five square rigged [[school ship]]s entered the race, Denmark's ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', Norway's ''[[Christian Radich (ship)|Christian Radich]]'' and ''Sorlandet'', Belgium's ''Mercator'' and Portugal's first ''[[Sagres (ship)|Sagres]]''. The vessels would meet again the following year and every year since in an annual series that would astonish its original organizers today. Old vessels were saved or repaired and new purpose built sail training vessels were commissioned. With renewed interest in the age of sail, national sail training associations affiliated to [[Sail Training International]] (STI) (formerly "Sail Training Association") were organized and large summer events find upwards of 100 ships racing across the oceans.

Crew exchanges allow young people from one country to sail with those from another. Long before the end of the [[Cold War]], ships from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] (which in some cases had been built in Germany) joined the International Fleet in 1974. A limited exchange between the [[Eastern bloc|East]] and West was initiated. One of the largest of the affiliate organizations of the STI is the [[American Sail Training Association]] (ASTA). Founded in 1973 with a handful of vessels, it has since grown to encompass an international organization with more than 250 tall ships representing 25 different countries. The UK National Member of STI is the Association of Sail Training Organisations (ASTO) Founded in 1972, http://www.asto.org.uk

Square rigged seamanship was in danger of becoming a lost art. As the 1997 restoration of the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] neared completion, the [[United States Navy]] called on the crew of [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/RobinWalbridge.php | title = TallShipBounty.org | accessdate = 11 October 2010 | quote = The highlight of his career, however, is the two years and over 15 voyages spent training the crew of "Old Ironsides," the U.S.S.

Many boats are historical vessels and replicas which require coordinated manual labor to sail, operating in the original tradition proposed by Alan Villiers and Irving Johnson such as the ''[[Picton Castle (ship)|Picton Castle]]'' while others are purpose built educational platforms carrying out scientific research under sail such as the ''[[Robert C. Seamans (ship)|Robert C. Seamans]]'' and the ''[[Corwith Cramer (ship)|Corwith Cramer]]'' of the [[Sea Education Association]]. Another new direction is the development of floating maritime heritage centres, connected to a sail training organisation, and often in co-ordination with land based maritime museums. [[Tall Ship Atyla]] is one such example of this, with visitors to the Bilbao Maritime Museum enjoying free entry to the ship during the winter months when she is moored nearby.  As the crew of the ''[[Irving Johnson (Tall ship)|Irving Johnson]]'' and the award winning program at the Los Angeles Maritime Institute like to say ''"We do not train youth for a life at sea ... we use the sea to educate youth for life"''.

== Vessel classifications ==
[[Tall ship]]s have been found to be effective platforms for sail training as they combine many elements fundamental to sail training.
A "Tall ship" is not a strictly defined type of vessel. "Tall ship" is commonly used today to define a large, traditionally rigged vessel, whether or not is it technically a ship.  For example, the [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|USCGC ''Eagle'']] is technically a [[barque]] and not a [[full rigged ship]].  A tall ship is usually defined by the topmast and [[topsail]]s she carries as opposed to the modern high aspect ratio rigs and [[Bermuda rig|marconi mains]] carried by the [[sloop]]s and [[yawl]]s seen in every harbor today.

For the purpose of classification and race rating, the STI divides Tall ships into the following classes :

:'''Class A''': All vessels over 160 feet in length overall, regardless of rig, and [[square rig]]ged vessels over 120 feet in length.
:'''Class A; Division II''': All square rigged vessels less than 120 feet in length.
:'''Class B''': [[Fore-and-aft rig|Fore-and-aft]] rigged vessels between 100 feet and 160 feet in length
:'''Class C''': All other fore-and-aft rigged vessels at least 30 feet long at the [[waterline]].

The [[United States Coast Guard]] classifies vessels based on their intended use and structure, prescribing requirements for  [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] and crew manning, waters the vessel may operate in, number of passengers allowed and minimum safety equipment required.

With the exception of uninspected vessels, all such vessels are inspected annually and issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which must be displayed on the vessel and spells out the requirements that vessel must maintain. 

:'''Sailing School Vessel (SSV)''':  Inspected under Title 46, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  An SSV is a vessel of less than 500 gross tons carrying six or more sailing school students or instructors, primarily propelled by sail, and operated by a nonprofit educational organization exclusively for the purpose of sailing education.

:'''Passenger Vessel''': Certified according to the size and number of passengers (not engaged in educational activities or in the operation of the vessel) carried under Title 46 of the CFR.
::'''Subchapter C''': Uninspected vessels which operate with no more than six passengers.
::'''Subchapter T''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than six passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter K''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than 150 passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter H''': Passenger vessels of more than 100 gross tons that carry passengers for hire and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.

:'''Attraction Vessel''': Certification is required whenever a vessel is open to public boarding or conducts dockside programs.  The vessel may be permanently moored to a pier, or it may be certified under one or more of the above subchapters, but the Attraction Vessel COI certifies its safety for dockside and visitation only.

:'''Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV)''': Certified under Subchapter U  of Title 46 of the CFR.  An ORV is a vessel employed exclusively in either oceanographic (saltwater) or limnologic (freshwater) instruction and/or research, and is not necessarily equipped for passengers or other non-professionals.

The '''semiotic square''', also known as the '''Greimas square''', is a tool used in structural analysis of the relationships between [[semiotic]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] through the opposition of concepts, such as feminine-masculine or beautiful-ugly, and of extending the relevant ontology.

The semiotic square, derived from Aristotle's logical [[square of opposition]], was developed by [[Algirdas J. Greimas]], a [[France|French]]-[[Lithuania]]n [[linguist]] and semiotician, who considered the semiotic square to be the elementary structure of meaning.

Greimas first presented the square in ''Semantique Structurale'' (1966), a book which was later published as ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method'' (1983).  He further developed the semiotic square with Francois Rastier in "The Interaction of Semiotic Constraints" (1968).

== Basic structure ==

The Greimas Square is a model based on relationships:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure
! Relationship Type
! Relationship Elements
|-
| Complex
| Contrary
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Neutral
| Contrary
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 1
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 2
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 1
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 2
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

*S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = positive [[seme (semantics)|seme]]
*S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = negative seme
*S = complex axis (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*~S = neutral axis (neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
# The Semiotic Square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two contrary signs. S&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;is considered to be the assertion/positive element and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the negation/negative element in the binary pair:
# The second binary relationship is now created on the ~S axis.  ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be the complex term, and ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the neutral term. This is where the principle of difference is brought into play: every element in a system is defined by its differences from the other elements. 
# In most modes of interpretation, the S-axis is a hyponym of the ~S-axis.  The ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; element combines aspects of S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is also contradictory to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . The ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element contains aspects of neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; .
# Finally, the ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element can be identified. Considered to be "always the most critical position and the one that remains open or empty the longest time, for its identification completes the process and in that sense constitutes the most creative act of the construction.".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric. 1987. "Foreword." ''On Meaning: Selected Writings.'' Algirdas Julien Greimas. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Starting from a given opposition of concepts S1 and S2, the semiotic square entails first the existence of two other concepts, namely ~S1 and ~S2, which are in the following relationships:

* S1 and S2: opposition
* S1 and ~S1, S2 and ~S2: contradiction
* S1 and ~S2, S2 and ~S1: complementarity

The semiotic square also produces, second, so-called meta-concepts, which are compound ones, the most important of which are:

* S1 and S2
* neither S1 nor S2

For example, from the pair of opposite concepts masculine-feminine, we get:

* S1: masculine
* S2: feminine
* ~S1: not-masculine
* ~S2: not-feminine
* S1 and S2: masculine and feminine, i.e. hermaphrodite, gender-fluid
* neither S1 nor S2: neither masculine nor feminine, agender

== Styles of interpretation ==

The Greimas Square is a tool used within the system of semiotics.
*As such, one form of interpretation is to look at each of the elements: S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2 as either developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (bi-modal) or [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (tripartite) sign.
*In the Peircean system of semiotics, the [[interpretant]] becomes the representamen for another, interrelated sign. In this same way, each of the elements of the Semiotic Square (S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2) can become an element in a new, interrelated square.
*Finally, Greimas suggests placing semiotic squares of associated meaning on top of one another to create a layered effect and another form of analysis and interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The square is a map of logical possibilities. As such, it can be used as a heuristic device, and in fact, attempting to fill it in stimulates the imagination. The puzzle pieces, especially the neutral term, seldom fall conveniently into place … playing with the possibilities of the square is authorized since the theory of the square allows us to see all thinking as a game, with the logical relations as the rules and concepts current in a given language and culture as the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Katilius-Boydstun, Marvin. 1990. “The Semiotics of A.J. Greimas: An Introduction,” Litanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences. 36(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Édouard-Henri Avril (13).jpg|thumb|250px|Sexual penetration occurring in the [[missionary position]], depicted by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]

'''Sexual penetration''' is the insertion of a body part or other object into a [[body orifice]], such as the [[vagina]], [[anus]] or [[mouth]], as part of [[human sexual activity]] or [[animal sexual behavior]].

The term is most commonly used in statute law in the context of proscribing certain sexual activities. Terms such as “[[sexual intercourse]]” or “[[carnal knowledge]]” are more commonly found in older statutes, while many modern criminal statutes use the term “sexual penetration” because it is a broad term encompassing (unless otherwise qualified) any form of penetrative sex, including digital (meaning with the digits, i.e., the fingers) or with an object, and may involve only the most minimal penetration. Some jurisdictions refer to some forms of penetration as "acts of indecency", or other terminology. 

==Definitions==
When a [[Human penis|penis]] is inserted into a woman's vagina, it is generally called vaginal or sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Biology|isbn =0495561819|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|page=314|accessdate=April 30, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=09reWGhFDqUC&amp;pg=PA314|author=Cecie Starr, Beverly McMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual intercourse| publisher=''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate=September 5, 2012|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexual-intercourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a penis penetrates another person's anus, it is called [[anal sex]] or anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 978-0-8018-9396-4|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press|JHU Press]]|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|author1 = Barry R.

Penetrative [[oral sex]] may involve penetration of the mouth by a penis ([[fellatio]]) or the use of the tongue to penetrate a woman's vagina or [[vulva]] ([[cunnilingus]]). The tongue may also penetrate the anus during [[anilingus]], which is a form of oral and anal sex. If one or more fingers are used to penetrate an orifice, it is called [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or digital penetration. The insertion of an object, such as a [[dildo]], [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] or other [[sex toy]], into a person's genital area or anus may also be considered sexual penetration.

==Unlawful==
{{See also|Human sexual activity#Legal issues}}
Penetrative [[sex crimes]] are generally considered more serious than [[non-penetrative sex]] crimes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ Guidelines for sentencing, UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115152923/http://cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/sexual_assult_by_penetration/ |date=2013-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual penetration of a child even more so. A child below the statutory [[age of consent]] generally cannot consent to acts involving sexual penetration. In laws, the term ''sexual penetration'' is commonly used in relation to sex with children. Unlawful sexual penetration is generally an offense irrespective of how deep the penetration was and irrespective of whether [[ejaculation]] of semen took place.

Laws may distinguish particular forms of sexual penetration as part of the offense. For example, the law in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] provides:
{{quote|"Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree" is a [[felony]] that occurs where the offender "penetrates the vagina, anus or penis of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor", if the victim is "subjected to forcible compulsion", or is "under 12 years of age", or "is incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness"|[https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.411 Unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree], Oregon Statutes § 163.411}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexually penetrating a relative is an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/sex-with-an-adult-relative Sexual Offences Act 2003] retrieved 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of penetration have at times been considered [[Obscenity|obscene]] and been prohibited. Works containing such penetrations may be considered [[pornography]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12479">'''Teaching stories''' is a term used to describe narratives that have been deliberately created as vehicles for the transmission of wisdom. Whilst it is a term that has been used in a number of religious and other traditions, Shah's use of it was in the context of [[Sufi]] teaching and learning, within which this body of material has been described as the "most valuable of the treasures in the human heritage".&lt;ref name="Lessing1"&gt;{{cite web 
 |url= http://ishk.net/sufis/lessing_commandingself.html

 |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of teaching stories is enormous, including anecdotes, accounts of meetings between teachers and pupils, biographies, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[fables]] and [[jokes]]. Such stories frequently have a long life beyond the initial teaching situation and (sometimes in deteriorated form) have contributed vastly to the world's store of [[folklore]] and [[literature]].

==Function==
It is the teaching function of teaching stories that characterises them rather than any other categorisation, however much they may have other uses. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach:

:"A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth."

Thus these narratives also often have a wide circulation outside of any instructional function, where they frequently have cultural significance and entertainment value, or contain a moral answer or solution of some kind, or are put to use to reinforce belief. What makes them distincively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardin |first1=Shields Nancy |date=October 1977|title= The Teaching Story and Doris Lessing|journal= Twentieth Century Literature |volume=23 |pages= 314–25 |doi=10.2307/441260}}&lt;/ref&gt; They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;from Learning from Stories, A lecture by Idries Shah before a live audience in 1976 available as audio to download at {{cite web |url=http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328085109/http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}. Accessed March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the reading, rereading, discussion and interpretation of narratives in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah's study circles engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He would say: ‘that person only wants a guru’, or ‘this person can’t be taught, because he isn’t ready yet to learn’. Those whom he accepted were directed to Sufi teaching-stories and other writing by the great masters – among them Omar Khayyam, Jalaluddin Rumi, Hakim Sanai, El Ghazali and Saadi of Shiraz."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Doris Lessing]]:
:"A real teaching story, whether thousands of years old, or new, goes far beyond the parables that are still part of our culture. A parable has a simple message: this means that. But in a Sufi teaching story, there may be layers of meaning, some of them not to be verbalized. Current ways of "teaching" literature in schools and universities may make it difficult for literary people to approach Sufi literature as it should be: Sufis do not pull apart a tale to find its meaning, but cite the case of the child who has dismantled a fly and, left with a heap of wings, a head, legs, asks "Where is the fly?" In other words, a student learns to use the mind in ways unfamiliar to us. They "soak themselves" in the material. They ignore the analytical approach, and the practice of memorizing and regurgitating. The meaning of a Sufi tale comes through contemplation, and may take years."&lt;ref name="Lessing1" /&gt;

==Folktales==
Shah described many of the [[Folklore|folktales]] widely dispersed across the world as teaching stories, writing in the introduction to one such tale, [[The Three Princes of Serendip#The lost camel|The Lost Camel]], collected in his ''[[World Tales]]'':

:"Most of the instrumental and interpretative function of the folktale have tended to be overlooked in the literature, which still usually concentrates upon origins, upon fragmentary beliefs enshrined in the tales, and upon the light which is cast by plots and treatments on the attitudes of the people among whom the story is told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = World Tales
  | publisher = Octagon Press
  | year = 1991
  | pages = 336
  | isbn = 0-86304-036-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without denying the entertainment or moral value in the stories, Shah emphasised that there is in such tales an often hidden dimension of instruction. Stories, such as those from the [[Thousand and One Nights]] and other collections of traditional myths and folktales, are considered to fall into this category. Modern examples (although maybe not generally recognized as such) are some of the stories that have been retold and adapted by [[Disney animated feature film source material#From folk tales, fairy tales or legends|Disney]]. These tales have been adapted and laid out in the simplest form of their wisdom, making them easily accessible for children in particular. As [[Robert Ornstein]] has written:

:"On the surface teaching stories often appear to be little more than fairy or folk tales. But they are designed to embody - in their characters, plots and imagery - patterns and relationships that nurture a part of the mind that is unreachable in more direct ways, thus increasing our understanding and breadth of vision, in addition to fostering our ability to think critically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2002/02-147.html|title= Robert Ornstein To Speak at Library of Congress on Afghan "Teaching-Stories" and the Brain|date= October 16, 2002 |publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fables==
Though a "moral" is appended to many fables, for instance [[Aesop's Fables|the fables]] of [[Aesop]], Shah insisted that there were levels of meaning hidden in them that lay beyond the merely didactic:
:"The fables of all nations provide a really remarkable example of this, because, if you can understand them at a technical level, they provide the most striking evidence of the persistence of a consistent teaching, preserved sometimes through mere repetition, yet handed down and prized simply because they give a stimulus to the imagination or entertainment for the people at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ishk.net/teaching-stories/ | title = The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought | first = Idries| last = Shah| accessdate = 2017-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nasrudin stories ==
Shah published four books of tales of the [[Mulla Nasrudin]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-022-5}}, ''The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-021-7}}, ''[[The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin]]'', {{ISBN|0-86304-023-3}} and ''The World of Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are known throughout the [[Muslim world]]. Superficially, most of the stories may be told as jokes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasrudin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, but there is also the structure of the tale that functions as an analogy or metaphor for some aspect of human nature or learning.

{{quotation|A friend came to visit Nasrudin at home bringing a duck, and Nasrudin had it cooked to share with him. The next week someone called by, claiming to be the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him. The week after that someone came claiming to be the friend of the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him too. This continued, with the connection to the friend with the duck becoming more and more remote each time. Finally, when the next friend-of-cousin-of-friend-of-man-with-duck arrived, Nasrudin heated water up in a pot and then served it to the new guest. 
&lt;br /&gt;
"What's this?" said the man, tasting the hot water.
&lt;br /&gt;
"This," said Nasrudin, "is the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck."}}

==Worldwide dispersal and diffusion==
It is impossible to say how far back in time teaching stories go. Shah's collection ''[[World Tales]]'' includes the [[Tale of Two Brothers]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian story from around the 12th century BC. [[Jataka tales]] from India as far back as the 3rd century BC have travelled westwards via the [[Panchatantra]] and have long been recognised as having a teaching function. An example is [[The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal]] which made its first appearance In Europe some 900 years ago in [[Petrus Alphonsi]]'s collection of tales, the ''Disciplina Clericalis'' (which, according to E.L. Ranelagh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Ranelagh
  | first = E.L.
  | title = The Past we Share
  | publisher = Quartet Books Ltd
  | year = 1979
  | location = London, Melbourne, New York
  | page = 165
  | isbn = 0-7043-2234-X}} A cleric here could mean an educated layman as well as an ecclesiastic.&lt;/ref&gt; could be translated as "a course of study for the reader").

The [[blind men and an elephant]] is a well-known tale that has been used among [[Jainism|Jainists]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] in India, as well as by [[Persian people|Persian]] Sufi writers [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]], [[Attar of Nishapur]] and [[Rumi]]. Shah's ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', a collection of narratives gathered from classical [[Sufi]] texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries, gives Sanai's version.

Parallels with other religious traditions are obvious, wherever narratives are used instructionally rather than to generate or perpetuate belief or conformity. Examples might be [[Zen]] [[koan]]s,  Hasidic tales, and the [[parables]] of [[Jesus]]. Sometimes, as in The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal or The Blind men and an elephant, versions of the same story are put to use.

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4025">Cognitive anthropologist [[Pascal Boyer]] argued that minimally [[counterintuitive]] concepts (MCI) i.e., concepts that violate a few ontological expectations of a category such as the category of an agent, are more memorable than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive (MXCI) concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of experimental psychology studies have found support for Boyer's hypothesis.  Upal &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; labelled this as the minimal counterintuitiveness effect or the MCI-effect.

Boyer originally did not precisely specify the number of expectation-violations that would render an idea maximally counterintuitive.  Early empirical studies including those by Boyer himself &lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P., &amp; Ramble, C. (2001). "Cognitive templates for religious concepts". ''Cognitive Science'', 25, 535–564.&lt;/ref&gt; and others &lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt; did not study MXCI concepts.  Both these studies only used concepts violating a single expectation (which were labelled as MCI concepts).  Atran &lt;ref&gt;Atran, S. (2002). "In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion", Oxford, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to study memory for MXCI concepts and labeled concepts violating 2-expectations as maximally counterintuitive.  Studies by the I-75 Cognition and Culture Group &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2005). "Role of context in memorability of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts". In B. Bara, L. Barsalou, &amp; M. Bucciarelli (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 27th annual conference of the cognitive science society'', (pp. 2224–2229). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gonce, L., Upal, M., Slone, J., &amp; Tweney, R. (2006). "The role of context in the recall of counterintuitive concepts". ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', 6(3–4), 521–547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tweney, R. D., Upal, M. A., Gonce, L., Slone, D. J., &amp; Edwards, K. (2006). "The creative structuring of counterintuitive worlds". ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', 6, 483–498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A., Gonce, L., Tweney, R., et al. (2007). Contextualizing counterintuitiveness: How context affects comprehension and memorability of counterintuitive concepts. Cognitive Science, 31(3), 415–439.&lt;/ref&gt;  also labelled ideas violating two expectations as maximally counterintuitive.  Barrett &lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L. (2008). "Coding and quantifying counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical and methodological reflections". ''Method and Theory in the Study of Religion'', 20, 308–338.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that ideas violating 1 or 2 ontological expectations should be considered MCI and only ideas violating 3 or more expectations should be labelled MXCI.  Subsequent studies &lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Vukic, M., Upal, M. A., &amp; Trainor, C. "Understanding the role of context in memory for maximally counterintuitive concepts", in ''Proceedings of the 35th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; of the MCI effect have followed this revised labelling scheme.

Upal &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; has divided the cognitive accounts that explain the MCI effect into two categories: the [[Context-based model of minimal counterintuitiveness]], and content-based view of minimal counterintuitiveness.  The context-based view emphasizes the role played by context in making an idea counterintuitive whereas the content-based view ignores the role of context.

'''''Them: Adventures with Extremists''''' is a book by British journalist [[Jon Ronson]] published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/books/chapters/13-1st-ronson.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book accompanied Ronson's documentary series ''[[The Secret Rulers of the World]]'', which covered similar topics and depicted many of the same episodes. Both the series and book detail Ronson's encounters following theorists and activists residing on the fringes of the political, religious, and sociological spectrum.

Ronson chronicles his travels and interviews with "extremists" and attempts to uncover the mystery behind the "tiny elite that rules the world from inside a secret room". The book is written on the premise that perhaps extremists are not all that crazy, and as different as they may seem to be, they have a lot in common with each other (specifically the belief that a small group of very prominent people controls the fate of the entire world). From [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] ("[[Osama bin Laden]]'s man in [[Great Britain]]") to [[Thomas Robb]] (Grand Wizard of the Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]), Ronson exposes the hilarity and absurdity of their missions, but also, at times, their startling sanity.

His adventures lead him from Britain to [[Ruby Ridge]], Idaho, to Waco, Texas, all the way to Portugal. Ronson documents his journeys through the world with [[extremist]] tour guides and "the result is a funny, superbly controlled account of his wanderings through the wonderland of fanaticism and delusion" (jonronson.com).

Alongside subjects covered in ''[[The Secret Rulers of the World]]'', Ronson also describes encounters with radical Islamic activist [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]], [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[Thomas Robb]], Northern Irish politician [[Ian Paisley]] and film director [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]]. Omar Bakri Muhammad, Thom Robb, and Ian Paisley were the subjects of the earlier Ronson documentaries, ''Tottenham Ayatollah'', ''New Klan'', and ''Dr. Paisley, I Presume''.

Much of this book is dedicated to the meeting places of the [[Bilderberg Group]].

'''Timoclea''' or '''Timocleia of Thebes''' is a woman whose story is told by [[Plutarch]] in his ''Life of Alexander'', and at greater length in his ''Mulierum virtutes'' ("Virtues of Women").  According to Plutarch's biography of [[Alexander the Great]], when his forces took [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] during [[Alexander's Balkan campaign]] of 335 BC, [[Thracian]] forces pillaged the city, and a captain of the Thracian forces [[rape]]d Timocleia.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/alexandr.html Plutarch – Life of Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt;  After raping her, the captain asked if she knew of any hidden money.  She told him that she did, and led him into her garden, and told him there was money hidden in her [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;  When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timoclea pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into the well until the captain was dead.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Timoclea was seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander the Great.  She comported herself with great dignity and told Alexander that her brother was Theagenes, last commander of the [[Theban Sacred Band]], who died "for the liberty of Greece" at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father [[Philip of Macedon]].  Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; 

The story in the ''Mulierum virtutes'' is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F9uCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 Excerpt in] ''Alexander the Great: A Reader'', Ian Worthington, ed, pp. 70–71, Routledge, {{ISBN|1134435924}}, 9781134435920; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0208%3Achapter%3D24 Example 24 in the ''Mulierum virtutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Timoclée et Alexandre, Domenichino (Louvre INV 796) 02.jpg|thumb|Timoclea before [[Alexander the Great]], painting by [[Domenichino]], c. 1615, [[Louvre]].]]

Plutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, N. G. L., ''Sources for Alexander the Great: An Analysis of Plutarch's "Life" and Arrian's "Anabasis Alexandrou"'', pp. 154–155, 2007, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521714710}}, 9780521714716[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gay_i14p9oEC&amp;pg=PA154 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; who knew Alexander well; this survives only in quotations by others, which may not all be accurate.  The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced.  Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades.  The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet [[Pindar]] (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas R., Blackwell, Christopher W., ''Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life'', pp. 48–50, 2012, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1139576534}}, 9781139576536, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_MgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davent bm 5.jpg|thumb|[[Léon Davent]], Etching, c.1541/45, after [[Francesco Primaticcio]].  341 x 231 mm.]]
Timoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos|topos]].  But she featured in cycles on the ''Life of Alexander'', and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Aghion I., Barbillon C., Lissarrague, F., ''Gods and Heroes of Classical Antiquity'', Flammarion Iconographic Guides, pp. 30–31, 1996, {{ISBN|2080135805}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case in the cycle of [[fresco]]s painted in the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] in the 1540s by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and his team.  This was in the bedroom of [[Francis I of France|Francois I's]] mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|the Duchess of Étampes]] (1508–1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings.  The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle [[etching|etched]] as a print by [[Léon Davent]].&lt;ref&gt;Boorsch, Suzanne, in: Jacobson, Karen (ed), (often wrongly cat. as [[George Baselitz]]), ''The French Renaissance in Prints'', pp. 256–257, 1994, Grunwald Center, UCLA, {{ISBN|0962816221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. 

Here and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common ''[[The Continence of Scipio]]''; the subject likewise emphasized the magnamimity of the commander.  Timoclea sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Life of Alexander'' was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of [[The Family of Darius before Alexander]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]], which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=timoclea British Museum search]&lt;/ref&gt; was the painting by [[Domenichino]] of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of [[Louis XIV]], and then the [[Louvre]].  Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently.  A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an [[engraving]] of 1629–30 by [[Matthäus Merian]], a book illustration for a popular German world history by [[Johann Ludwig Gottfried]].  This was later adapted in an oil painting by [[Elisabetta Sirani]].&lt;ref&gt;Golahny, Amy, [https://www.lycoming.edu/art/amy/Golahny-Timoclea-SOURCE-2011.pdf 1 "Elisabetta Sirani’s Timoclea and Visual Precedent", ''Source'', 30, 2011, 37–42 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later literature==
A play, now lost, called ''Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes'' was performed at [[Hampton Court Palace]] before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and the English court at [[Candlemas]] 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by [[Thomas North]] was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylor's School, London]], directed by their master [[Richard Mulcaster]].&lt;ref name=lost&gt;[https://www.lostplays.org/lpd/Timoclea_at_the_Siege_of_Thebes Lost Plays Database], University of Melbourne, "Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes", Anon. (1574) &lt;/ref&gt;  They were one of a number of [[Boy player#Children's companies|companies of boy players]] active in [[English Renaissance theatre]] in London.  The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the [[Master of the Revels]], and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers.  It may not have been a great success, as the [[masque]] prepared to follow it, with ladies "with lightes being vj vertues" was "not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte."&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

Timoclea also appears in ''Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women'' by [[Thomas Heywood]], 1624, and as a minor character in [[John Lyly]]'s play  ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'',&lt;ref name=lost/&gt; a comedy also performed by boy players.  According to this, Timoclea and [[Campaspe]] were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as "a humble handmaid to Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;''"Campaspe" and "Sappho and Phao": John Lyly", ''The Revels Plays'', eds.

The '''Turner Museum of Glass''' is housed in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the [[University of Sheffield]], in England.  It is in the Hadfield Building with the entrance from Portobello Street.  It contains examples from ancient Egypt and Rome but mainly from major European and American glassworkers, with a particular focus on those from the 1920s to 1950s.&lt;ref name=TMW&gt;[http://www.turnermuseum.group.shef.ac.uk/biography.html Museum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|other types of typology|Typology (disambiguation)}}


'''Typology''' (in urban planning and architecture) is the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] classification of (usually physical) characteristics commonly found in buildings and urban places, according to their association with different categories, such as intensity of development (from natural or rural to highly urban), degrees of formality, and school of thought (for example, modernist or traditional).  Individual characteristics form patterns.  Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems). 

For an authoritative essay on Typology in urban planning and architecture, see Rafael Moneo's 1978 Essay 'On Typology', published in Oppositions magazine. In this article the history of the notion of type is traced from its origins in the French Enlightenment until the late 20th century.

The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations:&lt;br /&gt;  

[[Single-family detached home]]s set well back from a street on large [[land lot|lots]] (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American [[suburban]] places.&lt;br /&gt; 

Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America.  

An emphasis on typology is characteristic of [[New Urbanism]].  New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history.  Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

'''Values Modes''' is a [[Geodemographic segmentation|segmentation]] tool in the United Kingdom, based on the British Values Survey.

== Background ==
The Values Modes model was created in 1973, by Pat Dade and Les Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/viewpoints/Ubuntu-BOTU.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Ubuntu - BOTU Struggle |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool, which is owned by the company Cultural Dynamics, is used strategically in marketing and political campaigns. It divides the population by values, identifying three core groups: Settlers, Prospectors and Pioneers. It is the main subject of the book "What Makes People Tick",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Chris|title=What Makes People Tick?|date=2011|publisher=Matador|isbn=978 1848767 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Chris Rose.

== Methodology ==

=== Segmentation ===
The Values Modes tool is based on the premise of twelve discrete [[psychographic|psychographic types]], under three umbrella groups. These were developed using a combination of empirical research and the application of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]].&lt;ref name="cultdyn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/valuesmodes.html |title=CDSM Values Modes |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking ===
The British Values Survey asks a large sample of people a range of questions each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignstrategy.org/articles/usingvaluemodes.pdf Using Values Modes], Chris Rose and Pat Dada, 2007, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It uses their answers to track how values are changing. Researchers gauge shifts in the values composition of certain groups and track changes in the overall population.

=== Questions ===
The British Values Survey measures over 100 psychological attributes of individuals, and includes [[Shalom Schwartz]]'s [[Values scales]] model, which identifies ten core human values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], IPPR, October 2013, Nick Pecorelli, p.11-13&lt;/ref&gt; Questions are based on a simple [[Likert scale]]. They range from everyday concerns (i.e. "How much do you agree that products don't last as long as they used to?") to questions on social issues like the sentencing of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/bvs.html |title=BVS |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups and sub-groups ==
There are three core umbrella groups, each of which contains four sub-groups.

|-
| Pioneer group – ''inner-directed'' || Pioneers are motivated by [[self-realisation]]. Their views are governed by values of [[collectivism]] and fairness. In their personal lives they are ambitious, but seek internal fulfilment rather than the esteem of others. || 'Transitionals','Flexible Individuals', [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM2.html ‘Concerned Ethicals’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM4.html ‘Transcenders’] || 32%

They are often conscious of fashion or image, and tend to be [[swing voters]]. || [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM8.html ‘Golden Dreamers’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM7.html ‘Happy Followers’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM6.html ‘Now people’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM5.html ‘Tomorrow people’] || 37%
|-
| Settler group – ''sustenance-driven'' || Settlers are motivated by resources and by fear of perceived threats. They tend to be older, [[socially conservative]] and security conscious. They are often pessimistic about the future, and are driven by immediate, local issues affecting them and their family. || [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM12.html ‘Roots’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM11.html ‘Smooth sailing’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM10.html ‘Brave New Worlders’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM9.html ‘Certainty First’] || 31%

==Uses of Values Modes==

===Organisational uses===
A person's 'values group' can affect how they view most issues, from the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/CCEnV_Feb_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Climate Change, Energy and Values : Surveys in Five Countries |author=Chris Rose |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to taxation, immigration or economic and personal aspiration. Individuals with different values are said to perceive these issues differently, and are more amenable to certain changes. Values Modes is therefore used by some organisations to design policies, [[Behaviour Change Communication|behaviour change]] strategies and [[social marketing]] campaigns. It has been deployed in areas including [public health, recycling and road safety, and has particular usage among local authorities looking to build relations with residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/wp-content/uploads/Changing-Behaviours.pdf |format=PDF |title=NLGN : Changing Behaviours |author=Nigel Keohane |publisher=Nlgn.org |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values Modes is also said to have business uses, and has also been applied to [[corporate governance]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominantneedsanalysis.com/images/corporategovernance,executivevalues,organisationalperforma%85.pdf] {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's values can also affect the language they respond best to. Prospectors, for example, are reportedly more open than Settlers to statistics-led messaging, and there are also often clashes between service providers, who tend to be Pioneers, and service-users, who are often Settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thecampaigncompany.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/the-values-gap/ |title=The Values Gap &amp;#124; The Campaign Company Blog |publisher=Thecampaigncompany.wordpress.com |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Values Modes tool is therefore also used by some communications departments, to prevent “clashes” and to "tailor initiatives and messages to fit different value groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rsablogs.org.uk/2012/social-economy/making-sense-world/ |title=Making sense of the world - RSA |publisher=Rsablogs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political uses ===
Analysts who use the Values Modes tool claim that, as class-based voting has "dealigned",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2011/09/still-partying-like-1995-110922_7983.pdf Still Partying Like it's 1995], IPPR, Graeme Cooke, September 2011, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a more accurate model of [[voting behaviour]] than segmentation based on race or ethnicity, or social class-based approaches such as [[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic]] and [[ACORN (demographics)|ACORN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/campaigns/1328/speak-to-the-value-not-to-class.thtml |title=Speak to the Value Not to Class |publisher=Total Politics |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

This has affected how analysts who use Values Modes view politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf Beyond Class: The Motivational Values And  Political Affinities of British Voters], Chris Rose, April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], for example, it has been suggested that the distinction between [[Blue Labour|Blue]] and [[New Labour]] is largely a distinction between an appeal to Settler and Prospector values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The tool has also been used in the media to analyse [[Barack Obama]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhu |first=Jaideep |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/new-america-gives-obama-hope |title=A new America gives Obama hope |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore messaging in the film [[An Inconvenient Truth]], by [[Al Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/175 Media and Culture Journal, Vol. 12, No. 4 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; and to inform the debate about the possibility of a UK [[Brexit]] from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhu |first=Jaideep |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/02/no-again-all-things-euro |title=It’s no again to all things Euro: the rise of the new Eurosceptics |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led some to go further and link people's values to fundamental changes in [[Left-right politics|the political spectrum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Clarke |url=http://leftfootforward.org/2014/06/ukips-rise-isnt-the-end-of-politics/ |title=UKIP’s rise isn’t the end of politics – but it does mean the end of the left-right continuum |publisher=Left Foot Forward |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – although the three main [[UK political parties]] each have a fairly even mix of the three values groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf |format=PDF |title=Beyond Class: The Motivational Values And Political Affinities of British Voters |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UKIP===
Some figures on the political left have used the Values Modes tool to try and understand the rise of [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk/post/93886955583/ukip-and-the-migration-issue |title=UKIP and the migration issue &amp;#124; John Denham |publisher=Theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a political party with a predominantly Settler base (especially among those with Brave New World or Golden Dreamer values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Council_Elections_2013.html |title=Council Elections |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which is built on preoccupations with issues like immigration. Nick Pecorelli argues that Labour lost many of its Settler supporters in office, and attributes the rise of UKIP, in part, to this change, writing that “Labour Settlers, once the bedrock of the party’s support, are gradually being dislodged from their tribal loyalties”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Values Modes were used as part of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] strategy on 'Beating Ukip on the Ground',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk/post/93887140448/beating-ukip-on-the-ground |title=Beating UKIP on the ground &amp;#124; John Denham |publisher=Theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was incorporated into the Fabian Society paper, "Revolt on the Left".

==Changes to values==

===Within individuals===
The Values Modes tool is based on the premise that people switch between groups as life experiences change their values. If people's needs are met and goals are fulfilled they tend to make a transition through the groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf Beyond Class], p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This shift usually takes the form of a move from Settler to Prospector to Pioneer, as immediate, sustenance-driven needs are replaces with more abstract concerns.

===Over time===
The British Values Survey indicates that, since data collection began, the proportion of the [[UK population]] in different values groups has changed significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignstrategy.org/newsletters/values_dynamic_tippingpoint.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Values-Dynamic Tipping Point |author=Chris Rose |publisher=Campaignstrategy.org |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period 1973–2005 saw a shift away from Settler values&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.org.uk/pdf/sof1120.pdf Using Values Modes], p.1-4&lt;/ref&gt; – probably because of greater affluence meaning core needs were more often being met. Since the [[2008 economic crisis]], the survey describes a return, by some of the less optimistic Prospectors, to Settler values, perhaps as a result of resources being scarcer.

The table below&lt;ref name="cultdyn19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf |format=PDF |title=IPPR Report : The New Electorate |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracks changes to the UK values composition over time. The increase in Prospector values between 2011 and 2012 is "hints at a hesitant return to optimism or perhaps a normalisation of austerity."&lt;ref name="cultdyn19"/&gt;

== Criticism and alternative approaches ==
The [[Common Cause Foundation]] set of "cultural values"] is seen by some as an alternative approach to Values Modes. A RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) blog on the subject, written in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2013/02/understanding-your-values---a-group-exercise--new-uk-values-report&lt;/ref&gt;, described the Common Cause critique of Values Modes as being that "Rather than satiating that level of Maslow’s ‘Hierarchy of Needs’ – and thus prompting people move to new more globally compassionate, caring needs – Values Modes will just strengthen the values of selfish consumerism." Pat Dade, according to the blog, responded by saying that such an approach would "alienate many, perhaps even most of the UK population, who don’t enjoy the feeling of being lectured in worthy-sounding ''Guardian''-esque language, and rarely if ever change their behaviour as a result of it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24865">In [[geometry]], the '''Weber problem''', named after [[Alfred Weber]], is one of the most famous problems in [[location theory]]. It requires finding a point in the plane that minimizes the sum of the transportation costs from this point to ''n'' destination points, where different destination points are associated with different costs per unit distance.

The Weber problem generalizes the [[geometric median]], which assumes transportation costs per unit distance are the same for all destination points, and the problem of computing the [[Fermat point]], the geometric median of three points. For this reason it is sometimes called the Fermat–Weber problem, although the same name has also been used for the unweighted geometric median problem. The Weber problem is in turn generalized by the [[attraction–repulsion problem]], which allows some of the costs to be negative, so that greater distance from some points is better.

In the triangle case, the Fermat problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the distances between D and each of the three other points is minimized. It was formulated by the famous French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]] before 1640, and it can be seen as the true beginning of both location theory, and space-economy. Torricelli found a geometrical solution to this problem around 1645, but it still had no direct numerical solution more than 325 years later. Kuhn and Kuenne&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Harold W. and Robert E. Kuenne, 1962, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the Generalized Weber Problem in Spatial Economics." ''Journal of Regional Science'' 4, 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; found an iterative solution for the general Fermat problem in 1962, and, in 1972, [[Luc-Normand Tellier|Tellier]]&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1972, “The Weber Problem: Solution and Interpretation”, ''Geographical Analysis'', vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 215–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  found a direct numerical solution to the Fermat triangle problem, which is trigonometric. Kuhn and Kuenne's solution applies to the case of polygons having more than three sides, which is not the case with Tellier's solution for reasons explained further on.

The Weber problem consists, in the triangle case, in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimized. The Weber problem is a generalization of the Fermat problem since it involves both equal and unequal attractive forces (see below), while the Fermat problem only deals with equal attractive forces. It was first formulated, and solved geometrically in the triangle case, by [[Thomas Simpson]] in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Thomas, 1750, ''The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions'', London.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later popularized by [[Alfred Weber]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Alfred, 1909, ''Über den Standort der Industrien'', Tübingen, J.C.B. Mohr) — English translation: ''The Theory of the Location of Industries'', Chicago, Chicago University Press, 1929, 256 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn and Kuenne's iterative solution found in 1962, and Tellier's solution found in 1972 apply to the Weber triangle problem as well as to the Fermat one. Kuhn and Kuenne's solution applies also to the case of polygons having more than three sides.

In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out as it must do at the optimum. It constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. It was first formulated and solved, in the triangle case, in 1985 by [[Luc-Normand Tellier]].&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1985, ''Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité'', Chicoutimi, Gaëtan Morin éditeur, 280 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy found a solution to the Tellier problem for the case of polygons having more than three sides.

== Torricelli’s geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem ==
[[File:Figaa.jpg|thumb|alt=Torricelli's solution|right|upright=1.5| Torricelli's geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem.]]

[[Evangelista Torricelli]]’s geometrical solution of the Fermat triangle problem stems from two observations:

1– point D is at its optimal location when any significant move out of that location induces a net increase of the total distance to reference points A, B, and C, which means that the optimal point is the only point where an infinitesimal movement towards one of the three reference points induces a reduction of the distance to that point that is equal to the sum of the induced changes in the distances to the two other points; in fact, in the Fermat problem, the advantage to reduce the distance from A by one kilometer is equal to the advantage to reduce the distance from B by one kilometer or the distance from C by the same length; in other words, the activity to be located at D is equally attracted by A, B, and C;

2– according to an important theorem of Euclidean geometry, in a convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the opposite angles are supplementary (that is their sum is equal to 180°); that theorem can also take the following form: if we cut a circle with a chord AB, we get two circle arcs, let us say AiB and AjB; on arc AiB, any ∠AiB angle is the same for any chosen point i, and, on arc AjB, all the ∠AjB angles are also equal for any chosen point j; moreover, the ∠AiB and ∠AjB angles are supplementary.

It can be proved that the first observation implies that, at the optimum, the angles between the AD, BD, and CD straight lines must be equal to 360° / 3 = 120°. Torricelli deduced from that conclusion that:

1– if any triangle ABD, whose ∠ADB angle is equal to 120°, generates an ABDE convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the ∠ABE angle of the ABE triangle must be equal to (180°&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;120°)= 60°;

2– one way to determine the set of locations of D for which the ∠ADB angle is equal to 120° is to draw an equilateral ABE triangle (because each angle of an equilateral triangle is equal to 60°), where E is located outside the ABC triangle, and draw a circle round that triangle; then all the D’ points of the circumference of that circle that lie within the ABC circle are such that the ∠AD’B angle is equal to 120°;

3– the same reasoning can be made with respect to triangles ACD, and BCD;

4– this leads to draw two other equilateral triangles ACF and BCG, where F and G are located outside the ABC triangle, as well as two other circles round these equilateral triangles, and to determine the location where the three circles intersect; at that location, the angles between the AD, BD, and CD straight lines is necessarily equal to 120°, which proves that it is the optimal location.

== Simpson’s geometrical solution of the Weber triangle problem ==
[[File:Figb.jpg|thumb|alt=Simpson's solution|right|upright=1.5| Simpson's geometrical solution of the Weber triangle problem.]]

Simpson's geometrical solution of the so-called “Weber triangle problem” (which was first formulated by [[Thomas Simpson]] in 1750) directly derives from Torricelli's solution. Simpson and Weber stressed the fact that, in a total transportation minimization problem, the advantage to get closer to each attraction point A, B or C depends on what is carried and on its transportation cost. Consequently, the advantage of getting one kilometer closer to A, B or C varies, and the ∠ADB, ∠ADC and ∠BDC angles no more need to be equal to 120°.

Simpson demonstrated that, in the same way as, in the Fermat triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG were equilateral because the three attractive forces were equal, in the Weber triangle problem case, the constructed triangles ABE, ACF and BCG, where E, F and G are located outside the ABC triangle, must be proportional to the attractive forces of the location system.

The solution is such that:

1– in the constructed triangle ABE, the AB side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards C, the AE side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards B, and the BE side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A;

2– in the constructed triangle BCG, the BC side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A, the BG side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards B, and the CG side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards C;

3– the optimal point D is located at the intersection of the two circumferences drawn round the ABE and BCG constructed triangles.

A third triangle of forces ACF, where F is located outside the ABC triangle, can be drawn based on the AC side, and a third circumference can be traced round that triangle. That third circumference crosses the two previous ones at the same point D.

== Tellier’s geometrical solution of the attraction-repulsion triangle problem ==
[[File:Figc.jpg|thumb|alt=Tellier's solution|right|upright=1.5| Tellier's geometrical solution of the attraction-repulsion triangle problem.]]

A geometrical solution exists for the attraction-repulsion triangle problem. Its discovery is rather recent.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 2013, « Annexe 1 : Solution géométrique du cas triangulaire du problème d’attraction-répulsion », annex of the paper of Pierre Hansen, Christophe Meyer and Luc-Normand Tellier, « Modèles topodynamique et de la Nouvelle économie géographique : compatibilité, convergence et avantages comparés », in Marc-Urbain Proulx (ed.), 2013, ''Sciences du territoire II : méthodologies'', Québec, Presses de l’Université du Québec.&lt;/ref&gt;  That geometrical solution differs from the two previous ones since, in this case, the two constructed force triangles overlap the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle (where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are attraction points, and R, a repulsion one), while, in the preceding cases, they never did.

This solution is such that:

1– in the constructed triangle RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H, which partly overlaps the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle, the RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the RH side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H side is proportional to the repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w pushing away from point R;

2– in the constructed triangle RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I, which partly overlaps the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R location triangle, the RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the RI side is proportional to the attractive force &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w pointing towards A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I side is proportional to the repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w pushing away from point R;

3– the optimal point D is located at the intersection of the two circumferences drawn round the RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H and RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I constructed triangles.
This solution is useless if one of the forces is greater than the sum of the two other ones or if the angles are not compatible. In some cases, no force is larger than the two other ones, and the angles are not compatible; then, the optimal location lies at the point that exerts the greater attractive force.

== Tellier’s trigonometric solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems ==

[[File:Fige.jpg|thumb|alt=Non-coincidence of angles|right|upright=1.1| The case of non-coincidence of the vertices of the α angles.]]

More than 332 years separate the first formulation of the Fermat triangle problem and the discovery of its non-iterative numerical solution, while a geometrical solution existed for almost all that period of time. Is there an explanation for that? That explanation lies in the possibility of the origins of the three vectors oriented towards the three attraction points not coinciding. If those origins do coincide and lie at the optimum location P, the vectors oriented towards A, B and C, and the sides of the ABC location triangle form the six angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, and ∠6, and the three vectors form the ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; angles. It is easy to write the following six equations linking six unknowns (the angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, and ∠6) with six known values (angles ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C, whose values are given, and angles ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, whose values depend only on the relative magnitude of the three attractive forces pointing towards the A, B and C attraction points):

: ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠C ;
: ∠3 + ∠4 = ∠A ;
: ∠5 + ∠6 = ∠B ;
: ∠1 + ∠6 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 180°.

Unfortunately, this system of six simultaneous equations with six unknowns is undetermined, and the possibility of the origins of the three vectors oriented towards the three attraction points not coinciding explains why. In the case of non-coincidence, we observe that all the six equations are still valid. However, the optimal location P has disappeared because of the triangular hole that exists inside the triangle. In fact, as Tellier (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1972, “The Weber Problem: Solution and Interpretation”, ''Geographical Analysis'', vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 215–233.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown, that triangular hole had exactly the same proportions as the “forces triangles” we drew in Simpson's geometrical solution.

In order to solve the problem, we must add to the six simultaneous equations a seventh requirement, which states that there should be no triangular hole in the middle of the location triangle. In other words, the origins of the three vectors must coincide.

Tellier's solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems involves three steps:

1– Determine the angles ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; that are such that the three attractives forces &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w, &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w and &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w cancel each other to ensure equilibrium. This is done by means of the following independent equations:

: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;
: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;
: cos ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;( &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

2– Determine the value of angle ∠3 (this equation derives from the requirement that point D must coincide with point E):

: tan ∠3 = (k sin k’) / (1 + k cos k’) ;

where k = (CB/CA) (sin ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / sin ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;), and k’ = (∠A +∠B + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;minus; 180° ;

3– Solve the following system of simultaneous equations where ∠3 is now known:

: ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠C ;
: ∠3 + ∠4 = ∠A ;
: ∠5 + ∠6 = ∠B ;
: ∠1 + ∠6 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 180° ;
: ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠α&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 180°.

[[File:Figg.jpg|thumb|alt= Non-coincidence of points D and E |right|upright=1.6| The case of non-coincidence of points D and E.]]

Tellier (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, Luc-Normand, 1985, ''Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité'', Chicoutimi, Gaëtan Morin éditeur, 280 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the Fermat–Weber problem to the case of repulsive forces. Let us examine the triangle case where there are two attractive forces &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w and &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w, and one repulsive force &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w. Here as in the previous case, the possibility exists for the origins of the three vectors not to coincide. So the solution must require their coinciding. Tellier's trigonometric solution of this problem is the following:

1– Determine angle ∠e :

: cos ∠e = -( &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

2– Determine angle ∠p :
: cos ∠p = -( &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; &lt;sub&gt;A2&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / (2 &lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;w &lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;w)  ;

3– Determine angle ∠c :
: ∠c = 180° &amp;minus; ∠p ;

4– Determine angle ∠d :
: ∠d = ∠e &amp;minus; ∠c ;

5– Determine the value of angle ∠3 (this equation derives from the requirement that point D must coincide with point E):
: tan ∠3 = x / y ;
where	x = sin ∠f – (RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(sin ∠d sin [∠e &amp;minus; ∠b] / sin ∠c) ; 
and	y = (RA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/RA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(sin ∠d cos [∠e &amp;minus; ∠b] / sin ∠c) &amp;minus; cos ∠f ;

6– Determine ∠1 :
: ∠1 = 180° &amp;minus; ∠e &amp;minus; ∠3 ;

7– Determine ∠5 :
: ∠5 = 180° &amp;minus; ∠b &amp;minus; ∠c &amp;minus; ∠1 ;

8– Determine ∠2 :
: ∠2 = ∠a &amp;minus; ∠5 .

== Iterative solutions of the Fermat, Weber and attraction-repulsion problems ==

When the number of forces is larger than three, it is no longer possible to determine the angles separating the various forces without taking into account the geometry of the location polygon. Geometric and trigonometric methods are then powerless. Iterative optimizing methods are used in such cases. Kuhn and Kuenne (1962)&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Harold W. and Robert E. Kuenne, 1962, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the Generalized Weber Problem in Spatial Economics." ''Journal of Regional Science'' 4, 21–34.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested an algorithm based on [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] generalizing [[Weiszfeld's algorithm]] for the [[geometric median|unweighted problem]]. Their method is valid for the Fermat and Weber problems involving many forces, but not for the attraction–repulsion problem. In this method, to find an approximation to the point ''y'' minimizing the weighted sum of distances
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\, \|x_i-y\|,&lt;/math&gt;
an initial approximation to the solution ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is found, and then at each stage of the algorithm is moved closer to the optimal solution by setting ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the point minimizing the sum of weighted squared distances
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{\|x_i-y_j\|} \|x_i-y\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the initial weights ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the input points are divided by the distances from each point to the approximation from the previous stage.
As the unique optimal solution to a weighted least squares problem, each successive approximation may be found as a weighted average:
:&lt;math&gt;\left. y_{j+1}=\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_ix_i}{\| x_i - y_j \|} \right) \right/ \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{\| x_i - y_j \|} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

For the attraction–repulsion problem one has instead to resort to the algorithm proposed by Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Pey-Chun, Hansen, Pierre, Jaumard, Brigitte and Hoang Tuy, 1992, "Weber's Problem with Attraction and Repulsion," ''Journal of Regional Science'' 32, 467–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation of the land rent theory in the light of the attraction–repulsion problem ==

In the world of [[location theory|spatial economics]], repulsive forces are omnipresent. Land values are the main illustration of them. In fact a substantial portion of [[Bid rent theory|land value theory]], both rural and urban, can be summed up in the following way.

In the case where everybody is attracted by a single attraction point (the rural market or the urban central business district), competition between the various bidders who all want to locate at the center will generate land values that will transform the unique attraction point of the system into a repulsion point from the land value point of view, and, at the equilibrium, each inhabitant and activity will be located at the point where the attractive and the repulsive forces exerted by the center on them will cancel out.

== The attraction–repulsion problem and the New Economic Geography ==

The Tellier problem preceded the emergence of the [[Economic geography#New economic geography|New Economic Geography]]. It is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Ottaviano, Gianmarco and Jacques-François Thisse, 2005, « New Economic Geography: what about the N? », ''Environment and Planning A'' 37, 1707–1725.&lt;/ref&gt; as a prelude to the New Economic Geography (NEG) that developed in the 1990s, and earned [[Paul Krugman]] a [[Nobel Memorial Prize]] in Economic Sciences in 2008. The concept of attractive force is akin to the NEG concept of agglomeration or centripetal force, and the concept of repulsive force is akin to the NEG concept of dispersal or centrifugal force.

'''Writers of the Future''' ('''WOTF''') is a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] story contest that was established by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in the early 1980s. A sister contest, '''Illustrators of the Future,''' presents awards for science fiction art.  Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of "giving back" to the field that had defined his professional writing life.  The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers.  Notable past winners of WOTF include [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[James Alan Gardner]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Jay Lake]], [[Michael H. Payne]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Robert Reed (author)|Robert Reed]], [[Dean Wesley Smith]], [[Sean Williams (author)|Sean Williams]], [[Dave Wolverton]], [[Nancy Farmer (author)|Nancy Farmer]], and [[David Zindell]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Contest rules and procedures==

===Writers of the Future===
The Writers of the Future (WOTF) contest may be entered quarterly, and is open to authors who have no, or few, professional publications. The contest rules state that entrants cannot have had published "a [[novel]] or [[novella|short novel]], or more than one [[Novella|novelette]], or more than three [[short story|short stories]], in any medium. Professional publication is deemed to be payment and at least 5,000 copies or 5,000 hits."  Works that are less than 3,000 words and for which payment was less 6c/word, do not count as "professional" publications.  Stories of up to 17,000 words in length can be submitted to the contest. Poems, screenplays, non-fiction, etc., are not eligible.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;
{{Citation

  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts are judged with the authors' names deleted and are separated out in quarterfinal and semifinal award rounds by the Coordinating Judge (previously [[K. D. Wentworth]], currently [[Dave Wolverton]], and originally [[Algis Budrys]]). Eight finalists are sent to a panel of professional science fiction writers, who determine the top three awards. Prizes are $1000 (first place), $750 (second) and $500 (third).  The process is then repeated the next quarter.  At the end of the contest year, the four quarterly first place stories compete for a separate annual grand prize, the "Gold Award," which includes an additional $5000. The first, second and third-place winners and often a selection of the other finalist stories are published annually, for which the writers receive additional compensation for publication rights.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  Thus, a grand prize-winning author can make over $6000 for a single story - more than many writers receive for a first novel.&lt;ref&gt;Buckell, Tobias, "[http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2005/10/05/author-advance-survey-version-20/ Author Advance Survey]," version 2.0 (Oct 2005), retrieved 25 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some finalist stories not considered among the top three (in effect, the fourth or fifth placers) may be included in the annual anthology.  These are called "published finalists."  The writers are compensated for publication rights, but are not considered winners and receive no prize money, but are eligible to re-enter the contest.  Often writers will repeatedly enter the contest, quarter after quarter, until they either win or become ineligible due to publications elsewhere.

===Illustrators of the Future===
An artists' contest, the Illustrators of the Future (IOTF), was added in 1988.  Like the WOTF contest, the Illustrators contest is open to amateurs.  The Rules state: "The Contest is open to those who have not previously published more than three black-and-white story illustrations, or more than one process-color painting, in media distributed nationally to the general public, such as magazines or books sold at newsstands, or books sold in stores merchandising to the general public. The submitted entry shall not have been previously published in professional media as exampled above."&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Entrants submit a portfolio of three pieces of artwork, which are circulated among the judges.  Up to three winners are selected every quarter, each given a prize of $500.  Unlike the Writers, the Illustrators are not ranked.  After the completion of the contest year, each of the twelve Illustration winners is assigned one of the stories from among the twelve Writer winners, and given a month to return the finished illustration.  A single grand prize, also called the Gold Award, is accompanied by a prize of $5000 - judging is based only on the final illustration, not the initial portfolio.  While the art is judged according to standard artistic considerations (composition, draftsmanship, consistency of lighting, [[sense of wonder]], facial expressions, etc.), a key consideration during the final judging is whether or not the art would make the viewer want to read the accompanying story.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  The art is also included in the annual anthology, and illustrators are additionally compensated.

===Awards and workshop===
No official tallies are given for the number of entrants in either contest, but it is believed that thousands enter the Writers contest every quarter, while only hundreds enter the Illustration contest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Thus, the Illustration judges are sometimes often unable to find three deserving winners, and only pick one or two.  (This is not a problem for the Writing judges.)  Should the Illustration winners number less than twelve in a year, each illustrator is - as usual - assigned a single story to illustrate for purposes of determining who wins the Gold Award.  Returning the assigned illustration quickly does not directly correlate to winning the Gold Award, but those artists who do so are allowed the opportunity to illustrate additional stories.   

All winners and published finalists are invited to attend the annual week-long writers' and artists' workshops and Awards gala at the invitation and expense of the contest administration.  Tuxedoes and gowns are worn by the judges, administrators, and winners for the Awards gala (but members of the general public are casually attired), and various Hollywood actors are generally in attendance, in addition to prominent science fiction authors and artists.  These include the present judges in addition to a famous and generally elderly writer given a Lifetime Achievement Award.  While it is not required to attend the week-long festivities and seminars, it is thought by some that those in the running for the Gold Award may advance their cause by displaying professionalism and hard work at that time; judges for the contest, however, refute this, as the judging is done blindly in advance of the week-long pre-awards event and most judges don't arrive on site until the last day of the workshop.

==Judges==
Many noted writers and artists have judged WotF awards, or have won them themselves.

Anderson]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[Algis Budrys]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Brian Herbert]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Tim Powers]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], [[Robert J. Sawyer]], [[K. D. Wentworth]], and [[Jack Williamson]].&lt;ref name="writing judges"&gt;

==Connections to Scientology==
[[File:WOTF22cover.png|thumb|121px|Cover of Volume 22 of the anthology series ''Writers of the Future'', prominently featuring Hubbard's name]]

The original sponsor of the contest was [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]], Inc., the publishing arm of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to [[Author Services Inc.]] under the [[trade name]] [[Galaxy Press]], which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard's fiction and the contest anthologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard's name appears "above the title", and in at least as prominent a font. The prominence of Hubbard's name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard's status in the science fiction and literary communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Entering or winning the contest does not require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard's books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;

However, records with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] show that the rights to the Writers of the Future name were transferred from the L. Ron Hubbard estate ("Family Trust-B") to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trademark Assignment Abstract of Title | url = http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=tm&amp;sno=73703450 | work =  | publisher = [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date = 1989-01-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the 1993 [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] closing agreement with the Church of Scientology, the L. Ron Hubbard estate became part of the Church of Spiritual Technology, a "Scientology-related entity".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Scientology Settles With IRS | date = 1997-12-30 | newspaper = [[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:École de Physique des Houches (Les Houches Physics School) main lecture hall 1972.jpg|thumb|Summer, 1972, discussion in main lecture hall.  From left, [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Bryce DeWitt]], [[Kip Thorne]].]]
L’'''École de Physique des Houches''' (the Physics School of [[Les Houches]]) was founded in 1951 by a young French scientist, [[Cécile DeWitt-Morette]].

Historically the first lessons were given in 1951 by [[Léon van Hove]]  on quantum mechanics.  The conditions were very spartan with the lessons lasting eight weeks in alpine chalets devoid of all comforts, a few kilometers from the village of Les Houches.

Soon, the school rapidly attracted the greatest names of modern physics, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[John Bardeen]] amongst others.  The young students, then unknown, included such future scientists as [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], [[Georges Charpak]], and [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], all future winners of the Nobel prize for Physics, as well as mathematician [[Alain Connes]], future winner of the Fields medal.
