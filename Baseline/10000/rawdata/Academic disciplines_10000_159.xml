'''All About Us: Living and Growing''' is a British [[Sex and Relationships Education]] series for 5–13 year olds published by [[Channel 4]] on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. The series is often referred to by its short name of ''Living and Growing''. It covers the differences between a boy and a girl, [[Puberty]], how babies are made and how babies are born. The programmes were put into units 1, 2, 3 and 4.

In the first three units the programme includes gently introducing sex education to younger children, through puberty and birth, to media images, same-sex relationships and teenage pregnancy. The fourth unit covers puberty and body image in more detail with a focus on maintaining a healthy mind and body

Unit 1 - Age 5-7
Differences | How did I get here? | Growing up

Unit 2 - Age 7-9
Changes | How babies are made | How babies are born

Unit 3 - Age 9-11
Girl talk | Boy talk | Let's talk about sex

Unit 4 - Age 11-13
Puberty | Body image | Making the right choices

As of July 7, 2012, the DVDs were removed from the Channel 4 product catalogue as a result of the Government’s announcement that the PSHE curriculum is under review. The Alternative version, featuring the first three units, was released in 2013 as the review had not taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version listing|url=https://shop.channel4learning.com/?page=shop&amp;pid=26651|website=Channel 4 Shop|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Alternative version Girl Talk and Boy Talk were moved to Unit 2 which now focuses mainly on puberty. How babies are made and How babies are born took their place in Unit 3 and the Let's talk about sex episode was dropped.

==Controversy==

The program has come under scrutiny by parents because of its graphic depictions of sexual intercourse and foreplay in Unit 2, in which, among other scenes, it "shows a naked cartoon couple pillow fighting before having sexual intercourse in several positions, as a narrator describes sex and its physical changes as "fun and very exciting".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kathleen (2011-07-08) [http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/graphic-sex-ed-program-for-kids-to-stay-in-compulsory-science-classes-uk-of Graphic sex-ed program for kids can stay in compulsory science classes: UK official], ''Lifesitenews.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Alternative version removed some of more explicit content concerns have still been expressed and it has been noted that the worksheets remain unchanged and the original DVDs were not recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version review|url=https://www.spuc.org.uk/campaigns/safeatschool/livingandgrowingalternative|website=Society for the Protection of Unborn Children|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management''' is a graduate professional school at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

The mission of the Bren School is to play a leading role in researching environmental issues, identifying and solving environmental problems, and training research scientists and environmental-management professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1991, recognizing the need for a graduate school dedicated to the study of the environment, the [[Regents of the University of California]] established the School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Jeff Dozier]] became the school's first dean. In 1995, the first faculty were appointed, and in 1996 the first master's students were admitted, receiving their degrees in 1998. In 2000, the first PhD students were admitted. The first PhD degrees were awarded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the school received a major gift from the Donald Bren Foundation to provide funding for endowed faculty chairs, faculty scholars, visiting lecturers, conferences, and student support. In recognition of the gift, the school was renamed the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Bren Hall]] was completed, providing the school with the facilities and the physical focus it retains to this day.

== Degree programs ==
The Bren School offers Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) degree is a two-year program comparable to the [[Master of Environmental Management]] (MEM) degree offered by other schools. The Bren School chose to include "Science" in the name of its degree to emphasize its focus on environmental science.

One notable aspect of the master's program at the Bren School is the group project. The master's thesis for MESM candidates consists of a project, usually proposed by an agency or company having a local, statewide, nationwide, or international presence. Group projects begin during the spring quarter of the first year of study, and culminate in a final presentation to the Bren community, project stakeholders, and local professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/MESM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PhD in Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's PhD program is designed to prepare leaders in Environmental Science &amp; Management. The program is notable for its focus on a wide variety of environmental issues.

== Bren Hall ==
[[File:Bren Hall, UCSB.jpg|thumb|Bren Hall]]
The school's classrooms, laboratories, and other facilities are located in [[Bren Hall]]. Since opening in 2002, Bren Hall has been recognized as an exemplar of sustainable building practices. The building was the first laboratory building in the United States to receive a [[LEED Platinum]] certification from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/facilities/greening_bren_hall.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the building became the first structure in the nation to received a second [[LEED Platinum]] certification—the ''LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/news/platinum_eb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, Bren Hall received its third LEED Platinum certification. The building was the highest scoring LEED project in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/defining-projects-and-policies-2017-top-10-states|title=Defining projects and policies of the 2017 Top 10 States {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[molecular biology]], the '''cAMP-dependent pathway''', also known as the '''[[adenylate cyclase|adenylyl cyclase]] pathway''', is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]]-triggered [[signal transduction|signaling cascade]] used in [[cell communication]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-3480-X"&gt;{{cite book | author = Bruce Alberts | author2 = Alexander Johnson | author3 = Julian Lewis| author4 = Martin Raff | author5 = Dennis Bray| author6 = Karen Hopkin | author7 = Keith Roberts| author8 = Peter Walter | others =   | title = Essential cell biology | edition = 2nd | language = | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | year = 2004 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 978-0-8153-3480-4 | oclc = | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
cAMP was discovered by Earl Sutherland and Ted Rall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Aldebaran M.|last2=Lefkimmiatis|first2=Konstantinos|title=Extracellular Calcium and cAMP: Second Messengers as "Third Messengers"?|journal=Physiology|date=1 October 2007|volume=22|issue=5|pages=320–327|doi=10.1152/physiol.00019.2007|pmid=17928545|url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/5/320.long|language=en|issn=1548-9213}}&lt;/ref&gt; cAMP is considered a secondary messenger along with [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Aldebaran M.|last2=Lefkimmiatis|first2=Konstantinos|title=Extracellular Calcium and cAMP: Second Messengers as "Third Messengers"?|journal=Physiology|date=1 October 2007|volume=22|issue=5|pages=320–327|doi=10.1152/physiol.00019.2007|pmid=17928545|url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/5/320.long|language=en|issn=1548-9213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutherland won a Nobel Prize in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Aldebaran M.|last2=Lefkimmiatis|first2=Konstantinos|title=Extracellular Calcium and cAMP: Second Messengers as "Third Messengers"?|journal=Physiology|date=1 October 2007|volume=22|issue=5|pages=320–327|doi=10.1152/physiol.00019.2007|pmid=17928545|url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/22/5/320.long|language=en|issn=1548-9213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[G protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs) are a large family of [[integral membrane protein]]s that respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli.  Each GPCR binds to and is activated by a specific [[ligand]] stimulus that ranges in size from small molecule [[catecholamine]]s, lipids, or [[neurotransmitter]]s to large protein hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willoughby|first1=Debbie|last2=Cooper|first2=Dermot M. F.|title=Organization and Ca2+ Regulation of Adenylyl Cyclases in cAMP Microdomains|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=1 July 2007|volume=87|issue=3|pages=965–1010|doi=10.1152/physrev.00049.2006|pmid=17615394|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/87/3/965.long|language=en|issn=0031-9333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willoughby|first1=Debbie|last2=Cooper|first2=Dermot M.

The [[Gs alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha subunit]] of the stimulated G protein complex exchanges [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] for [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and is released from the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willoughby|first1=Debbie|last2=Cooper|first2=Dermot M.

In a cAMP-dependent pathway, the activated G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha subunit binds to and activates an enzyme called [[adenylyl cyclase]], which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP).&lt;ref name="pmid11264454"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanoune J, Defer N | title = Regulation and role of adenylyl cyclase isoforms | journal = Annu.

Specificity of signaling between a GPCR and its ultimate molecular target through a cAMP-dependent pathway may be achieved through formation of a multiprotein complex that includes the GPCR, adenylyl cyclase, and the effector protein.&lt;ref name="pmid11441182"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davare MA, Avdonin V, Hall DD, Peden EM, Burette A, Weinberg RJ, Horne MC, Hoshi T, Hell JW | title = A β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor signaling complex assembled with the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cav1.2 | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5527 | pages = 98–101 |date=July 2001 | pmid = 11441182 | doi = 10.1126/science.293.5527.98 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
{{Main article|function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase}}
In humans, cAMP works by activating protein kinase A (PKA, [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]]), one of the first few kinases discovered.  It has four sub-units two catalytic and two regulatory. cAMP binds to the regulatory sub-units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Xiaodong|last2=Ji|first2=Zhenyu|last3=Tsalkova|first3=Tamara|last4=Mei|first4=Fang|title=Epac and PKA: a tale of two intracellular cAMP receptors|journal=Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica|date=8 November 2016|volume=40|issue=7|pages=651–662|issn=1672-9145|pmc=2630796|pmid=18604457|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7270.2008.00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It causes them to break apart from the catalytic sub-units. The Catalytic sub-units make their way in to the nucleus to influence transcription.Further effects mainly depend on [[function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase|cAMP-dependent protein kinase]], which vary based on the type of cell.

cAMP-dependent pathway is necessary for many living organisms and life processes. Many different cell responses are mediated by cAMP; these include increase in heart rate, cortisol secretion, and breakdown of glycogen and fat. cAMP is essential for the maintenance of memory in the brain, relaxation in the heart, and water absorbed in the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Xiaodong|last2=Ji|first2=Zhenyu|last3=Tsalkova|first3=Tamara|last4=Mei|first4=Fang|title=Epac and PKA: a tale of two intracellular cAMP receptors|journal=Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica|date=8 November 2016|volume=40|issue=7|pages=651–662|issn=1672-9145|pmc=2630796|pmid=18604457|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7270.2008.00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This pathway can [[enzyme activator|activate enzyme]]s and [[gene expression|regulate gene expression]].  The activation of preexisting enzymes is a much faster process, whereas regulation of gene expression is much longer and can take up to hours. The cAMP pathway is studied through loss of function (inhibition) and gain of function (increase) of cAMP.

If cAMP-dependent pathway is not controlled, it can ultimately lead to hyper-proliferation, which may contribute to the development and/or progression of [[cancer]].

==Activation==
Activated GPCRs cause a conformational change in the attached G protein complex, which results in the G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha subunit's exchanging GDP for GTP and separation from the beta and gamma subunits. The G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha subunit, in turn, activates adenylyl cyclase, which quickly converts ATP into cAMP. This leads to the activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway.  This pathway can also be activated downstream by directly activating adenylyl cyclase or PKA.

Molecules that activate cAMP pathway include:
* [[cholera toxin]] - increases cAMP levels
* [[forskolin]] - a [[terpene|diterpene]] natural product that activates adenylyl cyclase
* [[caffeine]] and [[theophylline]] inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, which degrades cAMP - thus enabling higher levels of cAMP than would otherwise be had. 
* [[bucladesine]] (dibutyryl cAMP, db cAMP) - also a phosphodiesterase inhibitor
* [[pertussis toxin]], which increases cAMP levels by inhibiting Gi to its GDP (inactive) form. This leads to an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby increasing cAMP levels, which can lead to an increase in insulin and therefore hypoglycemia

==Deactivation==
The G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; alpha subunit slowly catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, which in turn deactivates the G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein, shutting off the cAMP pathway.  The pathway may also be deactivated downstream by directly inhibiting adenylyl cyclase or dephosphorylating the proteins phosphorylated by PKA.

Molecules that inhibit the cAMP pathway include:
* cAMP [[phosphodiesterase]] converts cAMP into AMP by breaking the phosphodiester bond, in turn reducing the cAMP levels
* [[Gi protein|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; protein]], which is a G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP levels.

[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] System '''A''' was the [[405-line television system|405 line]] analog broadcast [[television]] system broadcast in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Ireland]]. CCIR service was discontinued in 1985.

== Specifications ==

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System A (VHF Bands).svg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System A (VHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the audio and video carriers is -3.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 405 '''lines''' (or 202.5 lines in a field.) So the '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 405 times the frame frequency or 405•25=10125&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The '''video bandwidth''' was 3.0&amp;nbsp;MHz. The video signal modulates the carrier by [[amplitude modulation]], but a portion of the upper sideband is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial sideband modulation ('''AC3'''). The polarity of modulation is positive, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the [[video signal]] results in an increase in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the sync pulses (being "blacker than black") result in minimum power (possibly zero power) from the vision transmitter.

The [[audio signal]] was modulated by [[amplitude modulation]].

The separation between the audio AM carrier and the video carrier is -3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The total '''RF bandwidth''' of System A was 4.26&amp;nbsp;MHz, allowing System A to be transmitted in the 5.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels specified for television in the British VHF bands with an ample 740&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zone between channels.

In specifications, sometimes, other parameters such as vestigial sideband characteristics and gamma of display device are also given.

=== Colour TV ===
System '''A''' has variously been tested with the [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] colour systems. However, apart from out-of-hours technical tests in the 1950s and 1960s, colour was never transmitted officially on System A.

Colour tests were first radiated from [[Alexandra Palace transmitting station|Alexandra Palace]] from 7 October 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/british_ntsc_color.html British Experiments with NTSC Color]&lt;/ref&gt; When testing with NTSC between November 1956 and April 1958, the colour subcarrier was 2.6578125&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 'Q' bandwidth of 340&amp;nbsp;kHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +3.0&amp;nbsp;MHz). On the low-frequency side, a full 1.0&amp;nbsp;MHz single-sideband of the 'I' signal was radiated.&lt;ref&gt;http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When testing with PAL, the colour subcarrier was 2.66034375&amp;nbsp;MHz and the sidebands of the PAL signal had to be truncated on the high-frequency side at +330&amp;nbsp;kHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +3.0&amp;nbsp;MHz). On the low-frequency side, a full 1.0&amp;nbsp;MHz sideband was radiated. ( This behaviour would cause massive U/V crosstalk in the NTSC system, but delay-line PAL hides such artefacts. )

When used with SECAM, the FM carrier was nominally 2.66&amp;nbsp;MHz with a deviation of ±250&amp;nbsp;kHz.

None of the above colour encoding systems had any effect on the bandwidth of system '''A''' as a whole.

=== Improved audio===
No changes were made to the audio specification over the 49 years that the 405-line system was in use.

== Transmission channels ==
System '''A''' was the first formal broadcasting standard in the world. A European 41-68&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Band I]] television allocation was agreed at the 1947 ITU (International Telecommunications Union) conference in 1947, effectively "grandfathering in" the VHF allocation that has been used in Britain since 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">In [[rhetoric]], a '''climax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κλῖμαξ}}, ''klîmax'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"staircase" or "ladder") is a [[figure of speech]] in which [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, or [[clause]]s are arranged in order of increasing importance.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 57&lt;br&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smyth | first = Herbert Weir | year = 1920 | title = Greek Grammar | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge MA | isbn = 0-674-36250-0 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its use with clauses, it is also sometimes known as '''[[auxesis (rhetoric)|auxesis]]''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"growth").&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==Usage==
Climax is frequently used in [[persuasion]] (particularly [[advertising]]) to create [[false dilemma]]s and to focus attention on the positive aspects of the subject at hand. The initial inferior options make the final term seem still better by comparison than it would appear in isolation: "X is good, Y is better, Z is best" is a standard format. It can also be used in reverse to make the initial term seem better by comparison: "A isn't perfect but B is worse and C is worst."&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm|title=Auxesis|website=changingminds.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/|title=How to Use the Simple Power of Contrast to Become More Persuasive - Copyblogger|date=2007-04-30|work=Copyblogger|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/ 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticlimax==
An '''anticlimax''' or '''anti-climax''' is an abrupt descent (either deliberate or unintended) on the part of a speaker or writer from the dignity of idea which he appeared to be aiming at,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=P.G. |last=Wodehouse |title=Much Obliged, Jeeves }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a relative term, anticlimax requires a greater or lesser climax to precede it in order to have proper effect. An anticlimax can be intentionally employed only for a jocular or satiric purpose. It frequently partakes of the nature of [[antithesis]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"Die and endow a ''college'' or a ''cat''."

[[File:Coded aperture mask (for gamma camera).jpg|thumb|Coded aperture mask for [[gamma camera]] (for [[SPECT]])]]
'''Coded Apertures''' or '''Coded-Aperture Masks''' are grids, gratings, or other patterns of materials opaque to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelengths are usually high-energy radiation such as [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]]. By blocking radiation in a known pattern, a coded "shadow" is cast upon a plane. The properties of the original radiation sources can then be mathematically reconstructed from this shadow. Coded apertures are used in X- and gamma ray imaging systems, because these high-energy rays cannot be focused with lenses or mirrors that work for visible light.

==Rationale==
[[File:HURA_hexagonal_coded_aperture_mask_principle.svg|thumb|Simplified principle of operation of a HURA hexagonal coded aperture mask used in the SPI instrument of the INTEGRAL space telescope]]

Imaging is usually made at optical wavelengths by lenses and mirrors. However, for [[X-ray]]s and [[γ-ray]]s, lenses and mirrors do not exist, or else are impractical. Image modulation by apertures is therefore often used instead. The [[pinhole camera]] is the most basic form of such a modulation imager, but its disadvantage is low throughput, as its small aperture allows through little radiation. Only a tiny fraction of the light passes through the pinhole, which causes a low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. To solve this problem, the mask can contain many holes, in one of several particular patterns, for example. Multiple masks, at varying distances from a detector, add flexibility to this tool. Specifically the [[modulation collimator]], invented by [[Minoru Oda]], was used to identify the first cosmic X-ray source and thereby to launch the new field of [[X-ray astronomy]] in 1965. Many other applications in other fields, such as [[tomography]], have since appeared.

In a coded aperture more complicated than a [[pinhole camera]], images from multiple apertures will overlap at the detector array. It is thus necessary to use a computational algorithm (which depends on the precise configuration of the aperture arrays) to reconstruct the original image. In this way a sharp image can be achieved without a lens. The image is formed from the whole array of sensors and is therefore tolerant to faults in individual sensors; on the other hand it accepts more background radiation than a focusing-optics imager (e.g., a refracting or reflecting [[telescope]]), and therefore is normally not favored at wavelengths where these techniques can be applied.

The coded aperture imaging technique is one of the earliest forms of [[computational photography]] and has a strong affinity to [[astronomical interferometry]]. Aperture-coding was first introduced by Ables&lt;ref name=ables&gt;{{cite journal

== Well known types of masks ==

[[File:MURA mask, size 101.jpg|thumb|right|A rectangular MURA mask of size 101]]
Different mask patterns exhibit different image resolutions, sensitivities and background-noise rejection, and computational simplicities and ambiguities, aside from their relative ease of construction.

'''Copperplate''' is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing most commonly associated with [[Round hand|English Roundhand]]. Although often used as an [[umbrella term]] for various forms of pointed pen calligraphy, Copperplate most accurately refers to script styles represented in [[Copybook (education)|copybooks]] created using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio printmaking method]].

==History==
The first use of the term "Copperplate" was in [[Ambrose Heal|Sir Ambrose Heal]]'s 1931 work ''The English Writing-Masters and Their Copy-Books 1570-1800'', although the term may have been used earlier. The term derives from the practice of engraving English roundhand onto a copper plate, also known as intaglio printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iampeth.com/lesson/business-handwriting/styles-script|title=Styles of Script|website=[[IAMPETH]]|first=Joseph|last=Vitolo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Copperplate is typically written at a 55-degree angle, and written at a slow speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COllDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=%22copperplate+script%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixlae3srbeAhWQ3VMKHY6FCmsQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22copperplate%20script%22&amp;f=false|title=Copperplate Calligraphy from A to Z: A Step-by-Step Workbook for Mastering Elegant, Pointed-Pen Lettering|isbn=1612438792|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23285">[[Image:MET00506.jpg|thumb|Meteorites are often studied as part of cosmochemistry.]]
'''Cosmochemistry'''  (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος ''kósmos'', "universe" and χημεία ''khemeía'') or '''chemical cosmology''' is the study of the chemical composition of matter in the [[universe]] and the processes that led to those compositions.&lt;ref name=McSween&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSween|first1=Harry|title=Cosmochemistry|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-87862-4|last2=Huss |first2=Gary|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done primarily through the study of the chemical composition of [[meteorite]]s and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were some of the first solid material to condense from the early solar nebula, cosmochemists are generally, but not exclusively, concerned with the objects contained within the [[Solar System]].

==History==
In 1938, Swiss mineralogist [[Victor Goldschmidt]] and his colleagues compiled a list of what they called "cosmic abundances" based on their analysis of several terrestrial and meteorite samples.&lt;ref name=Goldschmidt&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldschmidt|first=Victor|title=Geochemische Verteilungsgestze der Elemente IX|date=1938|publisher=Skrifter Utgitt av Det Norske Vidensk. Akad|location=Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldschmidt justified the inclusion of meteorite composition data into his table by claiming that terrestrial rocks were subjected to a significant amount of chemical change due to the inherent processes of the Earth and the atmosphere. This meant that studying terrestrial rocks exclusively would not yield an accurate overall picture of the chemical composition of the cosmos. Therefore, Goldschmidt concluded that extraterrestrial material must also be included to produce more accurate and robust data. This research is considered to be the foundation of modern cosmochemistry.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, cosmochemistry became more accepted as a science. [[Harold Urey]], widely considered to be one of the fathers of cosmochemistry,&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt; engaged in research that eventually led to an understanding of the origin of the elements and the chemical abundance of stars. In 1956, Urey and his colleague, German scientist [[Hans Suess]], published the first table of cosmic abundances to include isotopes based on meteorite analysis.&lt;ref name=Suess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suess|first=Hans|author2=Urey, Harold|title=Abundances of the Elements|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1956|volume=28|issue=1|pages=53–74|bibcode = 1956RvMP...28...53S |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued refinement of analytical instrumentation throughout the 1960s, especially that of [[mass spectrometry]], allowed cosmochemists to perform detailed analyses of the isotopic abundances of elements within meteorites. in 1960, [[John Reynolds (physicist)|John Reynolds]] determined, through the analysis of short-lived nuclides within meteorites, that the elements of the Solar System were formed before the Solar System itself &lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Isotopic Composition of Primordial Xenon|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=April 1960|volume=4|issue=7|pages=351–354|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.351|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.351|bibcode = 1960PhRvL...4..351R }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began to establish a timeline of the processes of the early Solar System.

==Meteorites==
[[Meteorite]]s are one of the most important tools that cosmochemists have for studying the chemical nature of the Solar System. Many meteorites come from material that is as old as the Solar System itself, and thus provide scientists with a record from the early [[solar nebula]].&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt; [[Carbonaceous chondrite]]s are especially primitive; that is they have retained many of their chemical properties since their formation 4.56 billion years ago,&lt;ref name=McSween2&gt;{{cite journal| last=McSween| first=Harry| title=Are Carbonaceous Chondrites Primitive or Processed? A Review| journal=Reviews of Geophysics and Space Physics|date=August 1979| volume=17| issue=5| pages=1059–1078| doi=10.1029/RG017i005p01059 |bibcode = 1979RvGSP..17.1059M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore a major focus of cosmochemical investigations.

The most primitive meteorites also contain a small amount of material (&lt; 0.1%) which is now recognized to be [[presolar grain]]s that are older than the Solar System itself, and which are derived directly from the remnants of the individual supernovae that supplied the dust from which the Solar System formed. These grains are recognizable from their exotic chemistry which is alien to the Solar System (such as matrixes of graphite, diamond, or silicon carbide). They also often have isotope ratios which are not those of the rest of the Solar System (in particular, the Sun), and which differ from each other, indicating sources in a number of different explosive supernova events. Meteorites also may contain interstellar dust grains, which have collected from non-gaseous elements in the interstellar medium, as one type of composite [[cosmic dust]] ("stardust")&lt;ref name="McSween"/&gt;

Recent findings by [[NASA]], based on studies of [[meteorites]] found on [[Earth]], suggests [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]] and related [[organic molecules]]), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in [[outer space]].&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Callahan |first = M.P. |display-authors=2 |last2=Smith |first2=K.E. |last3=Cleaves |first3=H.J. |last4=Ruzica |first4=J. |last5=Stern |first5=J.C. |last6=Glavin |first6=D.P. |last7=House |first7=C.H. |last8=Dworkin |first8=J.P. |date=11 August 2011 |title=Carbonaceous meteorites contain a wide range of extraterrestrial nucleobases |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/10/1106493108 |publisher=[[PNAS]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1106493108 |accessdate=2011-08-15 |pmid=21836052 |pmc=3161613 |volume=108 |journal=Proc.

==Comets==
On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the ''[[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]]'' lander on [[comet]] [[67/P]]{{'s}} surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen [[organic compound]]s, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including [[acetamide]], [[acetone]], [[methyl isocyanate]] and [[propionaldehyde]].&lt;ref name="wapo20150730"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/philae-probe-finds-evidence-that-comets-can-be-cosmic-labs/2015/07/30/63a2fc0e-36e5-11e5-ab7b-6416d97c73c2_story.html |title=Philae probe finds evidence that comets can be cosmic labs |work=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |first=Frank |last=Jordans |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20150730"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Science_on_the_surface_of_a_comet |title=Science on the Surface of a Comet |publisher=European Space Agency |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20150731"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bibring |first1=J.-P. |last2=Taylor |first2=M.G.G.T. |last3=Alexander |first3=C. |last4=Auster |first4=U. |last5=Biele |first5=J. |last6=Finzi |first6=A.

In 2004, scientists reported&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=S. |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4552-space-molecules-point-to-organic-origins.html |title=Space molecules point to organic origins|publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=2004 |accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; detecting the [[spectral signature]]s of [[anthracene]] and [[pyrene]] in the [[ultraviolet light]] emitted by the [[Red Rectangle nebula]] (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053738|title=Estimated IR and phosphorescence emission fluxes for  specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Red Rectangle|date=2006|last1=Mulas|first1=G.|last2=Malloci|first2=G.|last3=Joblin|first3=C.|last4=Toublanc|first4=D.|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=446|issue=2|pages=537–549|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...446..537M|arxiv = astro-ph/0509586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt; that since they discovered [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs)—which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth—in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In August 2009, NASA scientists identified one of the fundamental chemical building-blocks of life (the amino acid [[glycine]]) in a comet for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Staff |title='Life chemical' detected in comet |date=18 August 2009 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8208307.stm |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[fullerenes]] (or "[[buckyball]]s") were detected in nebulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/724/1/L39| title=Formation Of Fullerenes In H-Containing Planetary Nebulae| last1=García-Hernández|first1=D.

In August 2011, findings by [[NASA]], based on studies of [[meteorites]] found on Earth, suggests [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]] and related [[organic molecules]]), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in [[outer space]].&lt;ref name="Callahan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigerwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA"/&gt;

In October 2011, scientists reported that [[cosmic dust]] contains complex [[organic compound|organic]] matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow |first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Organic Matter from Stars |url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwok |first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature10542  |bibcode=2011Natur.479...80K |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3 |pmid=22031328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2012, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sugar Found In Space|journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Detection of the simplest sugar, glycolaldehyde, in a solar-type protostar with ALMA|author=Jørgensen, J.

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to [[Interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] - "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins |url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |number=1 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in [[interstellar space]] (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important [[amino acid]]. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces [[adenine]], one of the four [[nucleobases]] that form the "rungs" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called [[ethanamine]], is thought to play a role in forming [[alanine]], one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code.

The Scheme was first launched in 1997 under the auspices of what eventually became the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA) and originally covered only museum collections. [[Harewood House]] became the first stately home to be awarded Designated status in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-first-stately-museum-of-england-1196544.html The first stately museum of England], ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was expanded to cover libraries and archives in 2005.

[[File:Angelic movers.jpg|thumb|250px|alt= Ornate manuscript illumination showing celestial spheres, with angels turning cranks at the axis of the starry sphere|Fourteenth-century drawing of angels turning the celestial spheres]]

Ancient, medieval and [[Renaissance]] astronomers and philosophers developed many different theories about the '''dynamics of the [[celestial spheres]]'''.  They explained the motions of the various nested spheres in terms of the materials of which they were made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces.  Most of these models were qualitative, although a few of them incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance.

==The celestial material and its natural motions==
In considering the physics of the celestial spheres, scholars followed two different views about the material composition of the celestial spheres.  For [[Plato]], the celestial regions were made "mostly out of fire"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'' 40a2–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornford 1957, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; on account of fire's mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'', 55d-56a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Platonists, such as [[Plotinus]], maintained that although fire moves naturally upward in a straight line toward its natural place at the periphery of the universe, when it arrived there, it would either rest or move naturally in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merlan  | first = Philip | title = Plotinus Enneads 2.2 | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 74 | pages = 179–191 | year = 1943 | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;186–7. | doi = 10.2307/283597 | jstor = 283597}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was compatible with [[Aristotle]]'s [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|meteorology]]&lt;ref name="Webster2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |first2=E.W. |last2=Webster |year=2006 |title=Meteorology |publisher=Digireads.com |isbn=978-1-4209-2748-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etvHt-bBafMC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a fiery region in the upper air, dragged along underneath the circular motion of the lunar sphere.&lt;ref name="Sorabji2005"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Sorabji |year=2005 |title=The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200-600 AD: Physics |series=G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8988-4 |lccn=2004063547 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QpQw8JDgQcC&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;pg=PA352 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aristotle, however, the spheres themselves were made entirely of a special fifth element,&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aether (classical element)|''Aether'' (Αἰθήρ)]], the bright, untainted upper atmosphere in which the gods dwell, as distinct from the dense lower atmosphere, ''Aer'' (Ἀήρ).&lt;ref&gt;''Aether'' was personified in mythology as the offspring of night and the dwelling place of Zeus.{{cite book |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D104#note2 |author=Hesiod |title=Theogony |at=lines 123-4, 929j}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the four terrestrial elements ([[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]) gave rise to the [[generation and corruption]] of natural substances by their mutual transformations, aether was unchanging, moving always with a [[uniform circular motion]] that was uniquely suited to the celestial spheres, which were eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd  1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"by simple bodies I mean those which possess a principle of movement in their own nature, such as fire and earth and their kinds&amp;nbsp;... there must necessarily be some simple body which revolves naturally and by virtue of its own nature with a circular movement."  Aristotle, ''On the heavens'', 268b28-269a8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth and water had a natural heaviness (''gravitas''), which they expressed by moving downward toward the center of the universe. Fire and air had a natural lightness (''levitas''), such that they moved upward, away from the center. Aether, being neither heavy nor light, moved naturally around the center.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;196–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The causes of celestial motion==

As early as Plato, philosophers considered the heavens to be moved by immaterial agents.  Plato believed the cause to be a [[Anima mundi|world-soul]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)#The Creation of the World Soul|created]] according to mathematical principles, which governed the daily motion of the heavens (the motion of the Same) and the opposed motions of the [[Planet#Ancient Greece to Medieval Europe|planets]] along the [[zodiac]] (the motion of the Different).&lt;ref&gt;Cornford 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle proposed the existence of divine [[unmoved mover]]s which act as [[Four causes#Final cause|final causes]]; the [[celestial spheres]] mimic the movers, as best they could, by moving with uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle maintained that an individual unmoved mover would be required to insure each individual motion in the heavens. While stipulating that the number of spheres, and thus gods, is subject to revision by astronomers, he estimated the total as 47 or 55, depending on whether one followed the model of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|Eudoxus]] or [[Callippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[On the Heavens]]'', Aristotle presented an alternate view of eternal circular motion as moving itself, in the manner of Plato's world-soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.J. |last=Cleary |year=1995 |title=Aristotle and Mathematics: Aporetic Method in Cosmology and Metaphysics |series=Philosophia Antiqua |publisher=E.J.

In his ''Planetary Hypotheses'', [[Ptolemy]] (c.90–168) rejected the Aristotelian concept of an external prime mover, maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a voluntary motion.  Each planet sends out motive emissions that direct its own motion and the motions of the [[epicycle]] and [[deferent]] that make up its system, just as a bird sends out emissions to its nerves that direct the motions of its feet and wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murschel | first = Andrea | title = The Structure and Function of Ptolemy's Physical Hypotheses of Planetary Motion | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 26 | pages = 33–61 | year = 1995 | bibcode = 1995JHA....26...33M | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40.| doi = 10.1177/002182869502600102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto E.

[[John Philoponus]] (490–570) considered that the heavens were made of fire, not of aether, yet maintained that circular motion is one of the two natural motions of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theological work, ''On the Creation of the World'' (''De opificio mundi''), he denied that the heavens are moved by either a soul or by angels, proposing that "it is not impossible that God, who created all these things, imparted a motive force to the Moon, the Sun, and other stars&amp;nbsp;– just as the inclination to heavy and light bodies, and the movements due to the internal soul to all living beings&amp;nbsp;– in order that the angels do not move them by force."&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is interpreted as an application of the concept of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] to the motion of the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildberg 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, pp. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an earlier commentary on Aristotle's ''Physics'', Philoponus compared the innate power or nature that accounts for the rotation of the heavens to the innate power or nature that accounts for the fall of rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji 1988, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic interpreters===

The Islamic philosophers [[al-Farabi]] (c.872–c.950) and [[Avicenna]] (c.980–1037), following Plotinus, maintained that Aristotle's movers, called intelligences, came into being through a series of [[Emanationism|emanations]] beginning with God.  A first intelligence emanated from God, and from the first intelligence emanated a sphere, its soul, and a second intelligence.  The process continued down through the celestial spheres until the sphere of the Moon, its soul, and a final intelligence.  They considered that each sphere was moved continually by its soul, seeking to emulate the perfection of its intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davidson | first = Herbert A. | title = Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of Human Intellect | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1992 | location = Oxford | pages = 44–48, 74–77 | isbn = 0-19-507423-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Wolfson 1958, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna maintained that besides an intelligence and its soul, each sphere was also moved by a natural inclination (''mayl'').&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, pp.&amp;nbsp;82–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpreter of Aristotle from [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]], [[al-Bitruji]] (d. c.1024), proposed a radical transformation of astronomy that did away with [[epicycles]] and eccentrics, in which the celestial spheres were driven by a single unmoved mover at the periphery of the universe.  The spheres thus moved with a "natural nonviolent motion".&lt;ref&gt;al-Biţrūjī. (1971) ''On the Principles of Astronomy'', 1.60-62, trans. Bernard R. Goldstein, vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–9.  New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr.  {{ISBN|0-300-01387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mover's power diminished with increasing distance from the periphery so that the lower spheres lagged behind in their daily motion around the Earth; this power reached even as far as the sphere of water, producing the [[tides]].&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;538–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

More influential for later Christian thinkers were the teachings of [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who agreed with Avicenna that the intelligences and souls combine to move the spheres but rejected his concept of emanation.&lt;ref name="Wolfson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering how the soul acts, he maintained that the soul moves its sphere without effort, for the celestial material has no tendency to a contrary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;539–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the [[mutakallim]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[atomism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Huff-175&gt;{{Cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;57 of {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/649338| issn = 0369-7827| last = Ragep| first = F.

===Medieval Western Europe===

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Plato's picture of the heavens was dominant among European philosophers, which led Christian thinkers to question the role and nature of the world-soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | first = John | last = Marenbon  | editor-last = Gersh | editor-first = Stephen | editor2-last = Hoenen | editor2-first = M.

In the early phases of the Western [[recovery of Aristotle]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c.1175–1253), influenced by medieval Platonism and by the astronomy of al-Bitruji, rejected the idea that the heavens are moved by either souls or intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;540–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adam Marsh]]'s (c.1200–1259) treatise ''On the Ebb and Flow of the Sea'', which was formerly attributed to Grosseteste, maintained al-Bitruji's opinion that the celestial spheres and the seas are moved by a peripheral mover whose motion weakens with distance.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), following Avicenna, interpreted Aristotle to mean that there were two immaterial substances responsible for the motion of each celestial sphere, a soul that was an integral part of its sphere, and an intelligence that was separate from its sphere.  The soul shares the motion of its sphere and causes the sphere to move through its love and desire for the unmoved separate intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, 87-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;516–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Avicenna, [[al-Ghazali]], [[Moses Maimonides]], and most Christian [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] identified Aristotle's intelligences with the [[angels]] of revelation, thereby associating an angel with each of the spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Aquinas rejected the idea that celestial bodies are moved by an internal nature, similar to the heaviness and lightness that moves terrestrial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attributing souls to the spheres was theologically controversial, as that could make them animals.  After the [[Condemnations of 1277]], most philosophers came to  reject the idea that the celestial spheres had souls.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;546–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Kilwardby]] (c. 1215–1279) discussed three alternative explanations of the motions of the celestial spheres, rejecting the views that celestial bodies are animated and are moved by their own spirits or souls, or that the celestial bodies are moved by angelic spirits, which govern and move them.  He maintained, instead, that "celestial bodies are moved by their own natural inclinations similar to weight".&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as heavy bodies are naturally moved by their own weight, which is an intrinsic active principle, so the celestial bodies are naturally moved by a similar intrinsic principle.  Since the heavens are spherical, the only motion that could be natural to them is rotation.  Kilwardby's idea had been earlier held by another [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] scholar, [[John Blund]] (c. 1175–1248).&lt;ref&gt;Weisheipl 1961, pp. 316-317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;547–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two slightly different discussions, [[John Buridan]] (c.1295–1358) suggested that when God created the celestial spheres, he began to move them, impressing in them a circular impetus that would be neither corrupted nor diminished, since there was neither an inclination to other movements nor any resistance in the celestial region.  He noted that this would allow God to rest on the seventh day, but he left the matter to be resolved by the theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;547–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = John Buridan | author-link = John Buridan | editor = Marshall Clagett | contribution = Questions on the Eight Books of the Physics of Aristotle | title = The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages | year = 1959 | page = 536 | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = John Buridan | author-link = John Buridan | editor = Marshall Clagett | contribution = Questions on the Four Books on the Heavens and the World of Aristotle | title = The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages | year = 1959 | page = 561 | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme]] (c.1323-1382) explained the motion of the spheres in traditional terms of the action of intelligences but noted that, contrary to Aristotle, some intelligences are moved; for example, the intelligence that moves the Moon's epicycle shares the motion of the lunar orb in which the epicycle is embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = A. D. Menut and A. J. Denomy | title = Le Livre du ciel et du monde | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1968 | pages = 286–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He related the spheres' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Dales 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;548–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = A. D. Menut and A. J. Denomy | title = Le Livre du ciel et du monde | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1968 | pages = 286–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence, the resistance of the sphere, and the circular [[velocity]], he said "this ratio ought not to be called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy, because an intelligence moves by will alone&amp;nbsp;... and the heavens do not resist it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Nicole Oresme | author-link = Nicole Oresme | editor = Edward Grant | title = De proportionibus proportionum ''and'' Ad pauca respicientes | place = Madison | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1966 | page = 293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grant, except for Oresme, scholastic thinkers did not consider the force-resistance model to be properly applicable to the motion of celestial bodies, although some, such as [[Bartholomeus Amicus]], thought analogically in terms of force and resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;502–3, 541-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Middle Ages it was the common opinion among philosophers that the celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, or angels, and not by some kind of an internal mover.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The movers and Copernicanism===

Although [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) transformed Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotelian cosmology by moving the Earth from the center of the universe, he retained both the traditional model of the celestial spheres and the medieval Aristotelian views of the causes of its motion.  Copernicus follows Aristotle to maintain that circular motion is natural to the form of a sphere.  However, he also appears to have accepted the traditional philosophical belief that the spheres are moved by an external mover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jardine | first = Nicholas | title = The Significance of the Copernican Orbs | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 13 | pages = 168–194 | year = 1982 | bibcode = 1982JHA....13..168J | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–183.| doi = 10.1177/002182868201300302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]]'s (1571–1630) cosmology eliminated the celestial spheres, but he held that the planets were moved both by an external motive power, which he located in the Sun, and a motive soul associated with each planet.  In an early manuscript discussing the motion of Mars, Kepler considered the Sun to cause the circular motion of the planet.  He then attributed the inward and outward motion of the planet, which transforms its overall motion from circular to oval, to a moving soul in the planet since the motion is "not a natural motion, but more of an animate one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Donahue | first = W. H.  | title = Kepler's First Thoughts on Oval Orbits: Text, Translation, and Commentary | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 24 | pages = 71–100 | year = 1993 | bibcode = 1993JHA....24...71D | postscript =, pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76, 85-88.| doi = 10.1177/002182869302400103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In various writings, Kepler often attributed a kind of intelligence to the inborn motive faculties associated with the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson 1962, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Copernicanism  the planets came to be seen as bodies moving freely through a very subtle aethereal medium.  Although many scholastics continued to maintain that intelligences were the celestial movers, they now associated the intelligences with the planets themselves, rather than with the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Grant 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;544–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic writing===

First described by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Mina Shaughnessy]] in the 1970s, [[Basic writing]] is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8269">'''Formal equivalence checking''' process is a part of [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), commonly used during the development of [[digital circuit|digital]] [[integrated circuit]]s, to formally prove that two representations of a [[circuit design]] exhibit exactly the same behavior.

== Equivalence checking and levels of abstraction ==

In general, there is a wide range of possible definitions of functional equivalence covering comparisons between different [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and varying granularity of timing details. 
*The most common approach is to consider the problem of machine equivalence which defines two [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous design]] specifications functionally equivalent if, clock by clock, they produce ''exactly'' the same sequence of output signals for ''any'' valid sequence of input signals. 
*[[Microprocessor]] designers use equivalence checking to compare the functions specified for the [[instruction set]] architecture (ISA) with a [[register transfer level]] (RTL) implementation, ensuring that any program executed on both models will cause an identical update of the main memory content.  This is a more general problem.
*A system design flow requires comparison between a transaction level model (TLM), e.g., written in [[SystemC]] and its corresponding RTL specification. Such a check is becoming of increasing interest in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design environment.

== Synchronous machine equivalence ==
The [[register transfer level]] (RTL) behavior of a digital chip is usually described with a [[hardware description language]], such as [[Verilog]] or [[VHDL]]. This description is the golden reference model that describes in detail which operations will be executed during which [[clock cycle]] and by which pieces of hardware. Once the logic designers, by simulations and other verification methods, have verified register transfer description, the design is usually converted into a [[netlist]] by a [[logic synthesis]] tool. Equivalence is not to be confused with functional correctness, which must be determined by [[functional verification]].

The initial [[netlist]] will usually undergo a number of transformations such as optimization, addition of [[Design For Test]] (DFT) structures, etc., before it is used as the basis for the placement of the logic elements into a [[physical layout]]. Contemporary physical design software will occasionally also make significant modifications (such as replacing logic elements with equivalent similar elements that have a higher or lower [[drive strength and/or area]]) to the netlist. Throughout every step of a very complex, multi-step procedure, the original functionality and the behavior described by the original code must be maintained. When the final [[tape-out]] is made of a digital chip, many different EDA programs and possibly some manual edits will have altered the netlist.

In theory, a logic synthesis tool guarantees that the first netlist is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the RTL source code.  All the programs later in the process that make changes to the netlist also, in theory, ensure that these changes are logically equivalent to a previous version.

In practice, programs have bugs and it would be a major risk to assume that all steps from RTL through the final tape-out netlist have been performed without error. Also, in real life, it is common for designers to make manual changes to a netlist, commonly known as [[Engineering Change Order]]s, or ECOs, thereby introducing a major additional error factor.    Therefore, instead of blindly assuming that no mistakes were made, a verification step is needed to check the logical equivalence of the final version of the netlist to the original description of the design (golden reference model).

Historically, one way to check the equivalence was to re-simulate, using the final netlist, the test cases that were developed for verifying the correctness of the RTL. This process is called gate level [[logic simulation]]. However, the problem with this is that the quality of the check is only as good as the quality of the test cases. Also, gate-level simulations are notoriously slow to execute, which is a major problem as the size of digital designs continues to grow [[exponent]]ially.

An alternative way to solve this is to formally prove that the RTL code and the netlist synthesized from it have exactly the same behavior in all (relevant) cases. This process is called formal equivalence checking and is a problem that is studied under the broader area of [[formal verification]].

A formal equivalence check can be performed between any two representations of a design: RTL &lt;&gt; netlist, netlist &lt;&gt; netlist or RTL &lt;&gt; RTL, though the latter is rare compared to the first two. Typically, a formal equivalence checking tool will also indicate with great precision at which point there exists a difference between two representations.

== Methods ==
There are two basic technologies used for boolean reasoning in equivalence checking programs:
*[[Binary decision diagram]]s, or BDDs: A specialized data structure designed to support reasoning about boolean functions. BDDs have become highly popular because of their efficiency and versatility.
*Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability: [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] solvers returns an assignment to the variables of a [[propositional formula]] that satisfies it if such an assignment exists.  Almost any boolean reasoning problem can be expressed as a SAT problem.

== Commercial applications for equivalence checking ==
Major products in the Logic Equivalence Checking (''LEC'') area of ''EDA'' are:

* ''FormalPro'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Questa SLEC'' by [[Mentor Graphics]]
* ''Conformal'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''JasperGold'' by [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]]
* ''Formality'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''VC Formal'' by [[Synopsys]]
* ''360 EC'' by [[OneSpin Solutions]]
* ''ATEC'' by [[ATEC Technologies, Inc.|ATEC]]

== Generalizations ==
*Equivalence Checking of Retimed Circuits:  Sometimes it is helpful to move logic from one side of a register to another, and this complicates the checking problem.
*Sequential Equivalence Checking:  Sometimes, two machines are completely different at the combinational level, but should give the same outputs if given the same inputs.  The classic example is two identical state machines with different encodings for the states. Since this cannot be reduced to a combinational problem, more general techniques are required.
*Equivalence of Software Programs, i.e. checking if two well-defined programs that take N inputs and produce M outputs are equivalent:  Conceptually, you can turn software into a state machine (that's what the combination of a compiler does, since a computer plus its memory form a very large state machine.)  Then, in theory, various forms of property checking can ensure they produce the same output.  This problem is even harder than sequential equivalence checking, since the outputs of the two programs may appear at different times; but it is possible, and researchers are working on it.

'''''Fundamentals of Physics''''' is a [[calculus]]-based [[physics]] textbook by [[David Halliday (physicist)|David Halliday]], [[Robert Resnick]], and [[Jearl Walker]]. The textbook is currently in its tenth edition (published 2013). The current version is a revised version of the original 1960 textbook ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'' by Halliday and Resnick, which was published in two parts (Part I containing Chapters 1-25 and covering mechanics and thermodynamics; Part II containing Chapters 26-48 and covering electromagnetism, optics, and introducing quantum physics).  A 1966 revision of the first edition of Part I changed the title of the textbook to ''Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics'', Part I, rev. ed. (New York, London, and Sydney: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966), pp. v-vi, and Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'', Part II, 2nd ed. (New York and London: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1962), pp. xi-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in [[college]]s as part of the [[undergraduate]] physics courses, and has been well known to [[science]] and [[engineering]] students for decades as "the gold standard" of [[freshman]]-level physics texts. In 2002, the [[American Physical Society]] named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.

The first edition of the book to bear the title ''Fundamentals of Physics'', first published in 1981, was revised from the original text by [[Farrell Edwards]] and [[John J. Merrill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physics.byu.edu/department/publications/merrill-0 Publications by John J. Merill], Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; Walker has been the revising author since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=HRW Jearl D Walker], Profile page at CSU Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gable CAD''', or '''Gable 4D Series''', was a British architectural [[computer-aided design]] package initially developed in the early 1980s.

==History==
Gable CAD was developed at the [[University of Sheffield]] in the mid-1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phiri|first=Michael|title=Information technology in construction design|year=1999|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0727726735|pages=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zn6uLnZEvAUC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;ots=D4yKyYjo2O&amp;dq=%22GABLE%20CAD%22%20sheffield&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GABLE%20CAD%22%20sheffield&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Professor Bryan Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programme Committee Members’ Short Biographies|url=http://www.creativityandcognition.com/cc_conferences/cc05/aw.php?bios=1|work=Creativity &amp; Cognition 2005|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was spun out into Gable CAD Systems Limited (incorporated in 1984)&lt;ref name="DueDil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gable Cad Systems Limited |url=https://www.duedil.com/company/gb/01844894/gable-cad-systems-limited |website=DueDil |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retained links with the university until its demise in 1996 when a court order was made for compulsory winding up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 November 1996|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/54583/pages/15306/page.pdf|work=The London Gazette|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early [[building information modeling]] application, Gable CAD was an advanced 2D and 3D design package with different modules, and was operated via a Windows-style interface and mouse running on [[UNIX]]. It was possible to create detailed 3D models and then generate 2D drawings or rendered visualisations from the data.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, R.N..

Brussels, Belgium, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assets of the company were acquired by [[Auxer]] in 1997 and aimed to complete the conversion of Gable CAD to [[Windows NT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auxer Industries Inc. announces the acquisition of Gable CAD Systems|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Auxer+Industries+Inc.+announces+the+acquisition+of+Gable+CAD+Systems...-a019249636|work=The Free Library|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not appear to have ever been released.

'''Immediate mode''' rendering is a style for [[application programming interface]]s of graphics libraries, in which client calls directly cause [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] of graphics objects to the display, or in which the data to describe [[rendering primitive]]s is inserted frame by frame directly into a [[command list]] (in the case of ''{{visible anchor|immediate mode primitive rendering}}''), without the use of extensive indirection to retained resources. It does not preclude the use of [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]]. In contrast to [[retained mode]], lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library. Instead, the application must re-issue all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes. This method provides the maximum amount of control and flexibility to the application program.

== Immediate mode primitive rendering ==


Primitive [[vertex attribute]] data may be inserted frame by frame into a [[command buffer]] by a [[rendering API]]. This involves significant bandwidth and processor time (especially if the [[graphics processing unit]] is on a separate bus), but may be advantageous for data generated dynamically by the [[CPU]]. It is less common since the advent of increasingly versatile [[shaders]], with which a [[graphics processing unit]] may generate increasingly complex effects without the need for CPU intervention.

== Immediate mode rendering with vertex buffers ==


Although drawing commands have to be re-issued for each new frame, modern systems using this method are generally able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of more memory-intensive display data by referring to that unchanging data (via [[Indirection (computing)|indirection]]) (e.g. [[texture maps|textures]] and [[vertex buffer]]s) in the drawing commands.

'''Indigenous archaeology''' is a sub-discipline of western archaeological theory that seeks to engage and empower indigenous people in the preservation of their heritage and to correct perceived inequalities in [[modern archaeology]]. It also attempts to incorporate non-material elements of cultures, like oral traditions, into the wider historical narrative. This methodology came out of the global anti-colonial movements of the 1970s and 1980s led by aboriginal and indigenous people in settler-colonial nations, like the United States, Canada, and Australia.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearsall|first1=Deborah M.|title=Encyclopedia of Archaeology|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Inc|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major issues the sub-discipline attempts to address include the repatriation of indigenous remains to their respective peoples, the perceived biases that western archaeology's imperialistic roots have imparted into its modern practices, and the stewardship and preservation of indigenous people’s cultures and heritage sites. This has encouraged the development of more collaborative relationships between archaeologists and indigenous people and has increased the involvement of indigenous people in archaeology and its related policies.&lt;ref name=Jstor1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Tim|title=Archaeologists and Indigenous People: A Maturing Relationship?|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=2011|volume=40|pages=363, 378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLEGE STUDENTS WORK WITH ARCHAEOLOGISTS AT "KOSTER DIG" AN ANCIENT INDIAN BURIAL SITE - NARA - 552495.jpg|thumb|College students work with indigenous peoples in archaeological dig]]

As a relatively recently formed variety of archaeology, the "tenets and practices of Indigenous archaeology are currently being defined",&lt;ref&gt;Atalay 2006: 292&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a sub-discipline, it is "unavoidably pluralistic, contingent, and emergent".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 2007: 7&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in practices under what is called indigenous archeology may range from Indigenous peoples being consulted about archaeological research and the terms of non-Native researchers, to instances of Native-designed and directed exploration of their "own" heritage.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Million 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion of development-related [[cultural resources management]] (CRM) archaeology has prompted many Aboriginal organizations to get involved. They have worked to translate their cultural and archaeological values into heritage management plans that supplant the colonial status quo. Beyond field-based applications, Indigenous archaeology can empower Indigenous peoples as they work toward [[decolonization]] of society in general and of archaeology in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 2008, Nicholas and Andrews 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It has generated considerable controversy among scholars, some of whom support the concept in principle, but believe that incorporation of certain indigenous viewpoints has led to "major constraints on the research" of historical indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger 2007: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential Biases in Western Archaeology ==
The modern science of archaeology involves the collection and study of material objects like human remains and culturally or historically significant items.&lt;ref name=Race&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gidtri|first1=A.|title=Imperialism and Archaeology|journal=Race|date=April 1, 1974|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has its origins in European colonial policies. Many historical items obtained throughout the 18th and 19th centuries were acquired from colonized third world nations by European or American scientists and explorers. Some items were paid for, but many were excavated from indigenous lands without the consultation or permission of the people the items were culturally significant to.&lt;ref name="Race" /&gt; In the case of human remains, there are many documented instances of indigenous bodies being removed from battlefields or from burial sites by researchers during this time period.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Many of these bodies were used to assemble collections for the purpose of biological and cultural studies. At the time, many bodies were also used by European and American scientists as evidence in the creation of racial classification systems.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

Modern archaeological practices ensure the items obtained from excavations are through legal means.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; The knowledge obtained from the study of these artifacts can offer many historical insights in a wide variety of fields. For instance, human remains can give information on topics from the migration patterns of ancient humans to the evolution and spread of modern diseases.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Robyn J.|last2=Jones|first2=Gareth|title=Archeological Human Remains Scientific, Cultural, and Ethical Considerations|journal=Current Anthropology|date=1998|volume=39|issue=2|pages=253, 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring this information requires historical artifacts or remains to study. Indigenous communities are often not included or consulted in this process, and the desires of local communities can be marginalized. Findings are often not shared with the communities artifacts are obtained from, and many old artifacts are stored in museum collections for extended periods of time without being used.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

== Development ==
Much of the tension between archeologists and [[First Nations]] in [[the Americas]] has arisen because the latter believe that "current heritage ethics and values almost exclusively reflect the values and beliefs of Euro-Americans."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Moh94|Mohs 1994]]. p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream archaeology has been complicit in variously objectifying, denigrating, and ignoring native people as it pursues the study of their past. Some scholars think that Native people have become estranged from their archaeological heritage because European-American scholars made an artificial distinction between prehistory and history that denies connection between contemporary cultures and archaeological ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wat05|Watkins 2005]] p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The social disruptions of Native American cultures due to losses from disease, warfare and encroachment of colonization resulted in many cases in the severing of their traditions of history keeping. By the time formal studies in archeology began, several centuries of Indigenous history had been dismissed and/or distorted by the new settlers, who became the colonial custodians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lip97|Lippert 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of discarded indigenous narratives, colonialist perspectives dominated the academic discourse and evaluated the indigenous history as a separate and less significant extension of the contemporary culture. The viewpoints of colonialist empires impressed predispositions and assumptions regarding indigenous culture and history, whether by destroying indigenous property, seizing land, or using state-sponsored propaganda and education to reinterpret the legacy of indigenous groups. Furthermore, access to archaeological findings and the means to correct biased or misleading portrayals of indigenous culture were limited by the relative lack of indigenous scholars participating directly in archaeology. The means of correcting and recovering the indigenous narrative are thus further damaged, and the imperialist-aligned interpretation of history is codified in the academics and archaeological practice. Colonialist views on indigenous culture are subsequently ingrained in the education system and the populace itself (Sonya 2006).

The legacy of anthropologists and archaeologists "behaving badly" with respect to native people has affected 21st century relations. For instance, indigenous peoples pushed for passage by the US Congress of the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), due to their strong dissatisfaction with the conduct of archaeologists. In their pursuit of science, they overrode strong cultural traditions associated with grave sites and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lip97|Lippert 1997]]. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Canada the legislature passed the [[Heritage Conservation Act]] (1994). Provincial governments have recognised that local First Nations had an interest in being consulted in the archaeological permit application process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-lyackson1.htm "[[Lyackson First Nation]] and Heritage Preservation"], Turtle Island News Network, June 2000, accessed 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, consultation has arranged for additional roles for them and sometimes become vehicles for community and economic development.

Debate about indigenous concerns about archeology have been related to criticism of 20th-century post-[[structuralism|structuralist]] and post-[[modernist]] approaches in the writing of history. Rossiter and Wood, and Windschuttle are among those who do not believe that Western enlightenment thought and "[[neoliberalism|neo-liberal capitalist frameworks]]" can be applied in a blanket manner to Indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ros05|Rossiter and Wood 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Win97|Windschuttle 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, scholars such as Cooper, Yellowhorn and Wylie have re-ignited fundamental debates that contrast the role and status of science against the role and status of Indigenous knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[#Coo06|Cooper 2006]], [[#Yel96|Yellowhorn 1996]] and [[#Wyl02|Wylie 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such scholars increasingly find fault with science's "universalizing myth" and its allegedly objective "[[view from nowhere]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nag86|Nagel 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt; its appeal to pan-human values and reliance on empirical modes of understanding. {{Who|date=March 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Many{{Who|date=March 2012}} agree with philosopher [[Alison Wylie]] in accepting empiricism as one route to productive knowledge, while finding "no reason to conclude that this insulates the scientific enterprise or its products from political, moral, or social scrutiny, much less establishes that scientific interests have a transcendent value that takes precedence over all other interests".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wyl05|Wylie 2005]]. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also Forsman 1997 and White Deer 1997).

Since the activism associated with the late twentieth century, Indigenous peoples have worked to develop strategies to use, protect, research and manage their cultural heritage. Indigenous archaeology is just one among the tools they are using to reclaim their heritage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Internalist archaeology ==
[[Eldon Yellowhorn]] has written about what is called internalist archaeology (2006). Primarily but not exclusively for the benefit of Native people, the internalist perspective has overturned the late 19th century, Eurocentric theory that the Native peoples were disappearing for good, or that they were unrelated to the ancient archaeological remains, or both (Yellowhorn 2006: 197). Internalism practitioners reconsider basic archaeological conventions that can carry connotations distasteful to First Nations and others. An example is what Yellowhorn calls "chronological oppression", that is, the European-American emphasis on a dichotomy between prehistory and history (the latter first documented by evidence in writing.(2006: 198).

Internalism encourages reclaiming by indigenous peoples of the archaeological record, and thus their connections to land, spirit and power. It treats oral narrative as a kind of middle-range theory (Yellowhorn 2006: 205), drawing on [[mythology]]’s established [[mnemonic]] role of "connecting higher with lower levels of abstraction" (Yellowhorn 2006: 202). Because internalism focuses on specific cultural traditions, for instance, using established archaeological methods to "search for the signatures" of oral narratives in the local archaeological record (Yellowhorn 2006: 137), it has appealed to Native practitioners and publics. Such an approach values a local understanding of history and is also grounded firmly in a global anthropological context. Yellowhorn says that it is best achieved through the "development of applicable theoretical frameworks borne of rigorous professionalism" (Yellowhorn 2006: 195).

== Archaeology and national politics==
The importance of archaeological sites and materials to Indigenous peoples’ case for their uninterrupted occupation of colonized lands cannot be overestimated: "control of cultural property is central to the struggle of decolonization, aboriginal self-government, and in some areas, First Nations cultural survival" (Walker and Ostrove 1995: 14). As archeology provides incontrovertible material related to past events, First Nations peoples are beginning to consider archeology as a practice they can use, rather than as a colonialist project or bureaucratic obstacle course. Archaeological sites and objects may serve the philosophy and process of decolonization; for instance, being used to negotiate land claims or to promote cultural cohesion. Indigenous groups have begun to insist on control of such resources in their transition toward self-determination (Walker and Ostrove 1995). A relationship is seen between archaeology and nationalism. According to Kohl and Fawcett, as well as Trigger, such a relationship is "not necessarily corrupt or intrinsically suspect", any more than it was when European-Americans were making all the decisions about archeological sites and materials.(Kohl and Fawcett 1995: 3; also Trigger 1983).

Scholars generally support the rights of Indigenous peoples to the sites and materials created and used by their ancestors. Canadian First Nations, and others in like circumstances, "hold better jurisdictional title", thus legislative authority, to heritage resources than either Canada or the provinces (Asch 1997: 66). Yet the disposition of these areas continues to challenge governments: “given the intellectual and political traditions of historically and colonially established behaviour still influential in nominally post-colonial societies, any change becomes an issue of national and inherently contested politics” (Boyd et al. 2005: 92). So while the care and management of heritage materials and sites is often among those areas first offered up by colonial governments at modern negotiating tables, few accommodations are made for the attendant financial demands and regulative license required for these transfers of responsibility (Mohs 1994).

== Self-determination ==
In once-colonial nations, the efforts of current governments to reconcile with First Nations people is having direct effects on the practical and legal aspects of stewardship of archaeological resources. Waves of globally and federally endorsed recognition of Aboriginal rights in general, and of heritage stewardship in particular, are pounding the shores of nominally post-colonial governments (see, for example, Ritchie [1994] on Australia, Watkins [2003] and Wylie [1999] on Canada and the United States, and Whitelaw [2005] on South Africa). Domestic commitments to honourable negotiation (e.g., Canada’s [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] [1996] and British Columbia’s New Relationship with Aboriginal Peoples [2005]) and a flush of heritage-specific pledges to more fully accommodate Native interests (e.g., [[World Archaeological Congress]] 1990, Canadian Archaeological Association 1997, [[Society for American Archaeology]] 1990) are reinvigorating the debate about the values, roles and responsibilities related to heritage stewardship.

The contributions of the indigenous viewpoint to archaeology also aid in addressing the problems of race that are integrated into the practice. The archaeological discourse can take a patronizing and judgmental interpretation of indigenous practices and artifacts without proper context, often portraying indigenous culture as comparatively flawed or inferior in technique and technology. These construe the notion of indigenous culture as particularly alien and foreign, building a racist image to the [[Indigenous_peoples#Non-indigenous_viewpoints|non-indigenous viewpoint]]. The incorporation of the indigenous viewpoint in the academics can normalize their culture in the overall historical narrative, and shift away from portraying indigenous peoples as "savage", and instead evaluate them equally with other world cultures (Echo-Hawk 2006).

The indigenous narrative is significantly influenced by the colonialist tendency to homogenize indigenous culture into one single entity. The contemporary historical sequence focuses on the fall of indigenous cultures as a result of the advent of empires, and portrays the end segment of their history as the only significant contribution. For example, the [[European_colonization_of_the_Americas|colonization of the Americas]] in Central and South America neglect the long history of the [[Aztec_Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca_Empire|Incan]] empires, and only associates those cultures with defeat in the context of colonization. The complex political and economic infrastructure and achievements of those indigenous societies, and their legacy leading up to that point, is discarded in the narrow scope of the colonial achievement. Additionally, characterizing the indigenous history as an era of collective defeat fails to distinguish between individual indigenous cultures, cutting off their own histories and obscuring the features unique to each society (Oland 2012).

== Indigenous and mainstream archaeologies ==

=== Applications ===
As Indigenous archaeology unfolds, two things are becoming clear that serve to highlight some of the principle similarities and differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives. First, most Indigenous archaeologies hold the view that archaeology makes up only one part of the cultural resources spectrum (Anyon 1991). The inclusion of spiritual, traditional use, linguistic and historical studies are influencing the direction of heritage research and management, just as anthropology’s standard [[Anthropology#Approaches to anthropology|four-field approach]] has done for archaeology. In both traditions, "intellectual and material aspects of these cultural practices are nearly impossible to separate and an attempt to do so threatens or undermines the practices themselves" (Smith and Jackson 2006: 312). Second, where archaeology and Indigenous archaeology diverge, is on the issue of human remains. These, according to most Indigenous practitioners and publics, are not the same as other kinds of cultural resources, their use and disposition should not be subject to the regulations or negotiations. However, archaeologists need them for their research and to advance society’s knowledge. This divide stems from how many people in both groups see the world. Scientists are trained in western schools of thought, which portrays time as linear. People beyond a couple generations into the past are seen as long gone, and it is less taboo to study their remains. In contrast, many indigenous cultures see time as circular and deceased ancestors as a current members of their society.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; In recent years the political climate has favored indigenous people. Many major European and American universities and museums have returned stored remains to indigenous communities around the world.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt;

Despite, or perhaps because of, these differences, Indigenous archaeology should not be seen as exclusive to Indigenous peoples. It has wide relevance outside Indigenous communities (Atalay 2006), where post-colonial methodology is wanting in quantity and quality. The practice of Indigenous archaeology provides non-Native people with a tool by which they may aid in the larger project of decolonization and reclamation of minority rights and identities. It actively recognizes the special rights, interests and responsibilities that Native people have in the realm of cultural heritage (e.g., Anyon 1991, [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith|L.T. Smith]] 2005, Wilson 2007; Yellowhorn 1996). Indigenous archaeology has become part of the greater transformative project of Indigenous research "that is active in pursuit of social and institutional change, that makes space for Indigenous knowledge, and that has a critical view of power relations and inequality" ([[Linda Tuhiwai Smith|L.T. Smith]] 2005: 89).

=== Managing differences ===
Negotiating the difference in Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspective, of course, entails an "increasingly holistic engagement…with modern native peoples who are direct heirs to the traditions they are studying" (Trigger 1990: 781-782), which is changing the whole thrust of archaeological practice and stewardship. Conservative factions in archaeology (e.g. McGhee 2008) are finding the risk of infidelity to the archaeological record too great to sanction an Indigenous archaeology, believing the endeavour to be too subjective to be considered archaeology. Abdicating the use of archaeology's unique set of methods for interpreting the past in favour of alternative lines of evidence (e.g. oral history, genealogical studies) is, critics argue, setting up competing, even incompatible, versions of history.

The disparity between the indigenous and non-indigenous interpretations of archaeological conduct may be addressed by the integration of indigenous perspective in explaining artifacts and observations initially made by non-indigenous archaeologists. The intent and historical background of particular historical remnants offered by the indigenous perspective can assist in the contemporary archaeological approach. For example, the rationale behind choice of material and method used in constructing historical artifacts would allow a fairer evaluation of indigenous technology to be seen in the historical narrative. In the same way, an archaeological approach headed by indigenous researchers could benefit from the input of non-indigenous research. A responsible and equitable account of indigenous history requires that the narratives of different cultures is taken into consideration by the parties involved (Croes 2010).

The late, eminent Canadian theoretician [[Bruce Trigger]] suggested archaeologists continue to rigorously evaluate each history based on "evidence of greater or lesser completeness and accuracy and on more or less sound reasoning" (1997: ix). Advocating a continued use of careful, objective assessment of such qualities can help integrate different aspects of the past into a more complete, holistic picture of history (ibid). The anthropological-Indigenous collaborative model inevitably raises hackles because at some point, somebody’s truth is going to have to be truer than someone else’s to move forward (or it will be presented as such; Cooper 2006). Where archaeologists' version of events contradicts First Nations' beliefs about their history, is each obliged to challenge others' myth-building? "If archaeologists knowingly treat the beliefs of Indian differently from those of Euro-Canadians," writes Trigger, "there is a danger that the discipline will descend into mythography, political opportunism, and bad science" (x). While he asserts that "the only morally defensible option" (x) in such cases is to report the truth (as far as it can be known), the real, social implications this could have on relationships predicated on goodwill and respect may be severe. Trigger acknowledges the influence that both [[cultural relativism]] and the great [[white guilt]] have on archaeologists looking to do the right thing, but maintains that above all, archaeology must retain the scientific method if it can hope to "refute claims being made by fascists, sexists, racists, and Indian-haters" (x). He insists that archaeologists have a responsibility not only to educate people, but to do so "honestly and frankly" (x) and to credit individuals with the ability to form their own opinions.

== Indigenous archaeology in practice ==
As the values and goals of descendent communities are incorporated into the structure of heritage management, a different picture of heritage stewardship should emerge. Where the Western mode is predicated on ideas of the public trust, the Indigenous stewardship paradigm is more often concerned with the care of living history (Smith and Burke 2003: 183-185; also Lawson 1997, Watkins 2003). Assigning custody of heritage on the basis of cultural patrimony respects the "traditionally, or historically, legitimate cultural or spiritual responsibility for the cultural property at hand" (Meskell 2002: 291), and infuses stewardship with a duty of familial care. The differences between the "public trust" school of archaeological thought, and the "cultural legacy" perspective of Indigenous thought have cognitive implications: the former isolates history, failing to link it with other people, places or times, while the latter binds the studied past with the present and future. The distinction can be as simple a matter as considering an archaeological skeletal specimen as object or ancestor (Smith and Burke 2003: 184-185). Or, it can be as complex as demonstrating continuity by drawing one’s past on the landscape for a world that relies on discontinuities to order time and space.

Controlling and preserving culturally significant archaeological materials and shaping the discourse around their history are the other primary issues of indigenous archaeology. The fact based nature of archaeology as a science leads it to value sources that do not have hard evidence, like material information or data, less than those that do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=M.J.|title=Bridging the gap: A critical analysis of implementing an indigenous archaeology approach in the management of cultural resources|date=2012|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous archaeology sees this approach as biasing the historical narrative because excludes cultures with non-material methods of preserving history, like oral traditions, from contribution as much to the historical narrative. It advocates for methods similar to the [[Four field approach]] in anthropology to negate this perceived bias.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

Legislation around the stewardship and preservation of archaeological and cultural sites is perceived to be similarly biased as well.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; It is seen as favoring sites that have physical objects there, and often requires them to be relatively untouched by the modernization. This excludes many sites of cultural or religious value to many indigenous communities. Many of these communities are either unwilling or unable to pay for the upkeep of sites that legislation does protect, so archaeologists are brought in to do so.&lt;ref name="fancyJstor" /&gt; This may cause conflict between the two groups, since archaeologists may use invasive methods of preservation that conflict with the desires or traditions of the local community. In response to this, programs for the training of indigenous people in archaeological practices in order to allow them to consult on ongoing dig sites and the consultation of local communities before archaeological experiments begin have become more widespread.&lt;ref name="Jstor1" /&gt; [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM) programs, along with expanded collegiate resources and museum programs in this area are helping to engage local communities and work to address these perceived biases.&lt;ref name="Jstor1" /&gt;

== Global Impact ==
Watkins (2005) presents an overview of the gradual progress of the Indigenizing of archaeology worldwide, lauding the few accomplishments and trying to "interpret the relative quiet of the Indigenous voice" (40). In Australia and New Zealand, Aboriginal peoples are using archeology as part of their reclamation of heritage and assertion of indigenous rights, where it is increasingly used in support of land claims and repatriation issues (39). The Canadian experience follows a similar trajectory, albeit at a slower pace. Specific examples of unambiguously successful Canadian collaborative projects include the partnership in [[British Columbia]] between [[SCES]] and [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU). Another was the [[DNA]] and other studies associated with ''Kwaday Dan Ts’inchi,'' the 500-year-old remains called "Long Ago Man Found", "discovered by sheep hunters in 1999 at the foot of a melting glacier in [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park]] in the [[Yukon]]". There was also cooperation on his reburial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sealaskaheritage.org/news/articles/article_dna_test.htm CATHY BROWN, Associated Press, "Giving blood in a search for history"], 13 June 2001, at Sealaska Heritage Institute, accessed 16 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;(Watkins 2005: 35).

[[File:UNDER THE DIRECTION OF PAUL FRISH, SKILLED NAVAJO WORKMEN PERFORM DELICATE ARCHAEOLOGICAL OPERATIONS. THE DIG IS A... - NARA - 544162.tif|thumb|Navajo workers excavate and archaeological dig.]]

The value of indigenous communities is taking becoming greater in archaeological projects that work with sensitive artifacts and cultural remnants, though conflict between contemporary and indigenous approaches still exist. For example, the integration of indigenous permissions in studying sites, such as Massachusetts's 1983 Unmarked Burial Law, assists in providing indigenous communities a measure of control over archaeological studies. However, indigenous communities dispute on whether or not their cultural practices should be subject to academic and legalistic judgement by external scholars. The demands on indigenous peoples concerning archaeological collaboration involve more burdens on the indigenous community to answer to archaeological probing, while traditional archaeological approaches do not change and fail to accommodate to indigenous needs (Matthews 2009).

The regions of Mesoamerica and South America are beginning the dialogue of indigenous interests in archaeology, which there as elsewhere takes a backseat to more pressing efforts to secure basic rights for First Peoples. The nations of [[Scandinavia]] have made minimal progress in considering the archaeology of the [[Sami people]] as a field of study, let alone involving the descendent populations in projects (Watkins 2005:38). In Africa, attention is focused on fundamental economic and human rights issues, which has forced the issue of indigenous participation in archaeology to the back compared to the status in developed nations (Watkins 2005:39).

The '''Institut français d'archéologie orientale''' (or '''IFAO'''), also known as the '''French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo''' is a French research institute based in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], dedicated to the study of the [[archaeology]], [[history]] and languages of the various periods of Egypt's civilisation.

The IFAO is under the authority of the [[Minister of National Education (France)|French Ministry for National Education, Advanced Instruction, and Research]].

The Institute conducts archaeological excavations and also publishes a number of books and journals.

==History==
The IFAO was created on 28 December 1880 by a signed decree of the [[List of Education Ministers of France|French Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts]] [[Jules Ferry]], which created a permanent Mission in [[Cairo]], intended as a counterpart in Egypt of the [[French School of Athens]] (Ecole française d'Athènes) and [[French School of Rome]] (Ecole française de Rome), under the name of French School of Cairo (École française du Caire).

The School adopted its current name of '''Institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale''' in 1898.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">'''The International Phytogeographic Excursions''' was a series of international meetings in [[plant geography]] that significantly contributed to exchange of scientific ideas across national and linguistic barriers and also to the rise of Anglo-American plant [[ecology]]. The initiative was taken by the British [[botanist]] [[Arthur Tansley]] at the International Geographic Congress in [[Geneva]] in 1908. Tansley and another early key figure, [[Henry C. Cowles]], were both much-inspired by the new 'ecological plant geography' introduced by [[Eugenius Warming]] and its quest for answering why-questions about plant distribution, as opposed to the traditional, merely descriptive 'floristic plant geography'. 

The '''First International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in the [[British Isles]] in 1911. It was organized by [[Arthur Tansley]] and went through parts of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

The '''Third International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was proposed in 1915, but postponed due to the [[First World War]]. It was finally carried through in 1923 in neutral [[Switzerland]], and as noted by [[John William Harshberger]] is his report in [[Ecology]], the participants from [[Germany]], [[France]] and other nations recently at war, coexisted peacefully. &lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929456 Harshberger, J.

The '''Fourth International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in Scandinavia in 1925 (July 2 to August 24). It formed as a trip through Sweden and Norway starting in [[Lund]] in southernmost [[Sweden]], passing [[Stockholm]], [[Uppsala]] and [[Abisko]], going down through Norway, ending in [[Oslo]]. It was organized by [[G. Einar Du Rietz]] from [[Uppsala University]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1648950 Raber, Oran (1925) The Fourth International Phytogeographic Excursion.

Veröffentlichungen des geobotanischen Institutes Rübel in Zürich, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, [[Eugenius Warming|Warmings]] 'ecological plant geography' had developed into [[plant ecology]] and the excursion programme returned to 'floristic plant geography'. Through the 1930s and after the [[Second World War]], the International Phytogeographic Excursions continued at regular intervals, but now outside the mainstream of [[ecology]]. At the same time, scientific exchange between plant ecologists had found other means.

The '''Fifth International Phytogeographic Excursion''' was held in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1928. It was organized by [[Karel Domin]]. &lt;ref&gt;Domin, K.

[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s, that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth, particularly when an intersex variation is visible. In some countries (particularly in Africa and Asia) this may include [[infanticide]], abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in [[East Africa]] may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a [[curse]].&lt;ref name="cschrcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"/&gt;

Intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, may be surgically and/or hormonally altered to fit perceived more socially-acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes.&lt;ref name="apeg2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=aafe43f3-c6a2-4525-ad16-15e4210ee0ac&amp;subId=16191 | title = Submission 88 to the Australian Senate inquiry on the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of people with disabilities in Australia | work = Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG) | date = 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such treatments may involve sterilization.

Implementation of human rights protections in legislation and regulation has progressed more slowly. In 2011, [[Christiane Völling]] won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention.&lt;ref name="voll" /&gt; In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] recognized for the first time a right for intersex persons to ''not'' undergo sex assignment treatment.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw nonconsensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Reuters| title = Surgery and Sterilization Scrapped in Malta's Benchmark LGBTI Law| work = The New York Times| date = 1 April 2015| url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/04/01/world/europe/01reuters-gay-rights-malta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Star Observer| authorlink = Star Observer | title = Malta passes law outlawing forced surgical intervention on intersex minors| work = Star Observer| date = 2 April 2015| url = http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/international-news-news/malta-passes-law-outlawing-forced-surgical-intervention-on-intersex-minors/134800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other human rights and legal issues include the right to life, protection from discrimination, access to justice and reparations, access to information, and legal recognition.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination, or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

Research indicates a growing consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal—if relatively rare—forms of human biology,&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=  Stephen |last = Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=978-0306467592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on medical practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]],&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

The [[Council of Europe]] highlights several areas of concern:

* unnecessary "normalising" treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* unnecessary medicalisation is said to also impact a right to life.
* inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law; facilitating access to justice and reparations.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* respecting self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{Citation| last1 = [[Council of Europe]]| last2 = Commissioner for Human Rights| title = Human rights and intersex people, Issue Paper| date = April 2015| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH/IssuePaper(2015)1&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights remains slow. These actions take place through legislation, regulation and court cases, detailed below.

=== "Pinkwashing" ===
{{main|Intersex and LGBT}}
Multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]". In June 2016, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI (LGBT and intersex) people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission: list of issues for Australia's Convention Against Torture review | url = https://oii.org.au/30546/loi-cat-review/ | work = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] | date = June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[Zwischengeschlecht]] described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Intersex legislation" that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people face stigmatisation and discrimination from birth. In some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, this may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families.

Non-consensual medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people take place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been explored.&lt;ref name="ghattas" /&gt; Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions.

{{further|Intersex human rights reports}}
These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions. In 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics reported.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; In 2013, they included the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,&lt;ref name="untorture"/&gt; and the Australian Senate.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; In 2015 they included the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. In April 2015, [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] became the first country to outlaw coercive medical interventions.&lt;ref name="nyt-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="star-2015" /&gt; In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right ''not'' to undergo sex affirmation interventions.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

For [[Intersex Awareness Day]], October 26, UN experts including the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee against Torture]], the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], along with the Council of Europe [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]s called for an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex persons, including in medical settings. The experts also called for the investigation of human rights abuses, access to reparations, and the implementation of anti-discrimination measures:&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Citation| last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| authorlink = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |title = End violence and harmful medical practices on intersex children and adults, UN and regional experts urge| date = October 24, 2016| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&amp;LangID=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In countries around the world, intersex infants, children and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures in an attempt to forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies. When, as is frequently the case, these procedures are performed without the full, free and informed consent of the person concerned, they amount to violations of fundamental human rights...

States must, as a matter of urgency, prohibit medically unnecessary surgery and procedures on intersex children. They must uphold the autonomy of intersex adults and children and their rights to health, to physical and mental integrity, to live free from violence and harmful practices and to be free from torture and ill-treatment. Intersex children and their parents should be provided with support and counselling, including from peers.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt;}}

Although not many cases of children with intersex conditions are available, a case taken to the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] led to changes in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Skyler|title=Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Development: The Constitutional Issues Created by the Surgical Treatment of Intersex Children|journal=McGeorge Law Review|year=2010–2011|volume=42|page=863|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr42&amp;div=66&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case restricted the power of doctors and parents to decide surgical procedures on children's ambiguous genitalia after the age of five, while continuing to permit interventions on younger children. Due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia on Case 1 Part 1 (SU-337 of 1999), doctors are obliged to inform parents on all the aspects of the intersex child. Parents can only consent to surgery if they have received accurate information, and cannot give consent after the child reaches the age of five. By then the child will have, supposedly, realized their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Constitucional de Colombia: Sentencia T-1025/02|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2002/t-1025-02.htm|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case led to the setting of legal guidelines for doctors' surgical practice on intersex children.

(2) In exceptional circumstances treatment may be effected once agreement is reached between the Interdisciplinary Team and the persons exercising parental authority or tutor of the minor who is still unable to provide consent: Provided that medical intervention which is driven by social factors without the consent of the minor, will be in violation of this Act.&lt;ref name="gigesc"&gt;{{Citation| last = Malta| title = Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act: Final version| date = April 2015| url = http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26805&amp;l=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Right to life==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
[[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] testing of [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the condition under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to [[assisted reproductive technology]], and requires [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. The technology allows discrimination against those with [[intersex]] traits.

[[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Carpenter]] highlights the appearance of several intersex variations in a list by the UK [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] of "serious" "genetic conditions" that may be de-selected, including [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]] and [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], traits evident in elite women athletes and "the world's first openly [[Tony Briffa|intersex mayor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| author-link=Morgan Carpenter |title = Morgan Carpenter at LGBTI Human Rights in the Commonwealth conference| location = Glasgow| date = July 18, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/27467/lgbti-human-rights-in-the-commonwealth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last1 = Carpenter| first1 = Morgan| last2 = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]| title = Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007| location = Sydney| date = April 30, 2014| url = http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory “sex selection” and “preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics”.

On August 12, 2005, the mother of a child, Benjamín, filed a lawsuit against the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)|Maule Health Service]] after the child's male gonads and reproductive system were removed without informing the parents of the nature of the surgery. The child had been raised as a girl. The claim for damages was initiated in the Fourth Court of Letters of [[Talca]], but ended up in the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. On November 14, 2012, the Court sentenced the Maule Health Service for "lack of service" and to pay compensation of 100 million pesos for moral and psychological damages caused to Benjamín, and another 5 million for each of the parents.&lt;ref name="diario.latercera.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condenan al H. de Talca por error al determinar sexo de bebé|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2012/11/24/01/contenido/pais/31-123780-9-condenan-al-h-de-talca--por-error-al-determinar-sexo-de-bebe.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124010101/http://diario.latercera.com/2012/11/24/01/contenido/pais/31%2D123780%2D9%2Dcondenan%2Dal%2Dh%2Dde%2Dtalca%2D%2Dpor%2Derror%2Dal%2Ddeterminar%2Dsexo%2Dde%2Dbebe.shtml|website=diario.latercera.com|accessdate=15 February 2017|archivedate=24 November 2012|dead-url=yes|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite web|last = García | first = Gabriela | title=Identidad forzada|url=http://www.paula.cl/reportajes-y-entrevistas/reportajes/identidad-forzada/|website=www.paula.cl|language=es| date = 2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, many intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed the birth of intersex babies as a "social emergency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coran|first1=Arnold G.|last2=Polley|first2=Theodore Z.|title=Surgical management of ambiguous genitalia in the infant and child|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|date=July 1991|volume=26|issue=7|pages=812–820|doi=10.1016/0022-3468(91)90146-K|pmid=1895191|citeseerx=10.1.1.628.4867}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure “normal” physical and psychosocial development.&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Holmes| first = Morgan| authorlink=Morgan Holmes |title = Is Growing up in Silence Better Than Growing up Different?| work = Intersex Society of North America| url = http://www.isna.org/node/743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Intersex Society of North America]]| title = What's wrong with the way intersex has traditionally been treated?| url = http://www.isna.org/faq/concealment#fn2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure also included telling people that they would never meet anyone else with the same condition.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt; Access to medical records has also historically been challenging.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; Yet the ability to provide free, informed consent depends on the availability of information.

The [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; and [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref name="who2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = World Health Organization| isbn = 9789241564984| last = [[World Health Organization]]| title = Sexual health, human rights and the law| location = Geneva| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the necessity for improvements in information provision, including access to [[medical record]]s.

Some intersex organizations claim that secrecy-based models have been perpetuated by a shift in clinical language to [[Disorders of sex development]]. [[Morgan Carpenter]] of [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] quotes the work of [[Miranda Fricker]] on "hermeneutical injustice" where, despite new legal protections from discrimination on grounds of intersex status, "someone with lived experience is unable to even make sense of their own social experiences" due to the deployment of clinical language and "no words to name the experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Organisation Intersex International Australia| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| title = Intersex and ageing| date = February 3, 2015 | url = https://oii.org.au/28385/intersex-and-ageing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal recognition ==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions, few countries have provided for the legal recognition of intersex people. The Forum states that the legal recognition of intersex people is:

* firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; 
* secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and 
* thirdly, while opt in schemes may help some individuals, legal recognition is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population, but instead is about enabling an opt-in scheme for any individual who seeks it.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

In some jurisdictions, access to any form of identification document can be an issue.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Gender identities===
Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8.5-20% of persons with intersex conditions may experience [[gender dysphoria]],&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

===Access to identification documents===
Depending on the jurisdiction, access to any birth certificate may be an issue,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|journal=Reuters|date=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a birth certificate with a sex marker.&lt;ref name="adv-de"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2013/11/06/op-ed-germany's-third-gender-law-fails-equality | first = Hida | last = Viloria | work = The Advocate | title = Op-ed: Germany's Third-Gender Law Fails on Equality | date = November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, in the case of ''Baby 'A' (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news| last = Migiro| first = Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; Many intersex persons in [[Intersex rights in Uganda|Uganda]] are understood to be stateless due to historical difficulties in obtaining identification documents, despite a birth registration law that permits intersex minors to change assignment.&lt;ref name="sipd2016"&gt;{{Cite| last = Support Initiative for Persons with Congenital Disorders| title = Baseline Survey on Intersex Realities in East Africa - Specific Focus on Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to the same rights as other men and women===
The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] states that:
{{quotation|Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that. For intersex people, this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents. Firstly, it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Binary categories===
Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth,&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements.&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

===Third categories===
The passports and identification documents of [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] and some other nationalities have adopted "X" as a valid third category besides "M" (male) and "F" (female), at least since 2003.&lt;ref name="Science as Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ingrid | last = Holme | title = Hearing People's Own Stories | journal = Science as Culture | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09505430802280784 | date = 2008| pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passports.govt.nz/Transgender-applicants|title=New Zealand Passports - Information about Changing Sex / Gender Identity|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as ''indeterminate gender'' on birth certificates, amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dw.de/third-sex-option-on-birth-certificates/a-17193869 | title = Third sex option on birth certificates | work = [[Deutsche Welle]] | date = 1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/bluff-package-for-inter-leaving-sex-entry-open-is-not-an-option/ | title = Sham package for Intersex: Leaving sex entry open is not an option | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rt.com/news/germany-allows-third-gender-062/ | title = 'X' gender: Germans no longer have to classify their kids as male or female | work = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach, and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper, stating that these may lead to "forced outings" and "lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex."&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; The Issue Paper argues that "further reflection on non-binary legal identification is necessary":

{{quotation|[[Mauro Cabral]], [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] (GATE) Co-Director, indicated that any recognition outside the “F”/”M” dichotomy needs to be adequately planned and executed with a human rights point of view, noting that: “People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker”&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

[[Image:Jackshaft two belt pulleys.png|thumb|A two-pulley jackshaft redirecting belt power from horizontal to vertical.]]

A '''jackshaft''', also called a ''countershaft'', is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it.  In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting [[Horsepower|power]] from a driving shaft to a driven shaft.

==History==
===Jackshaft===
The oldest uses of the term ''jackshaft'' appear to involve shafts that were intermediate between [[water wheel]]s or [[stationary steam engine]]s and the [[line shaft]]s of 19th century mills.&lt;ref&gt;James Emerson, Report of Water-Wheel Tests at Lowell and Other Places, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIII, No. 3 (March, 1872); pages 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holyoke Warter Power Co., Experiments with Gears, Belts and Draft Tubes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HD1EAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 Holyoke Hydrodynamic Experiments], Weaver Shipman and Co., Springfield, Mass., 1880; pages 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early sources from [[New England]] mills in 1872 and 1880, the term ''"jack shaft"'' always appears in quotes.  Another 1872 author wrote "Gear wheels are used in England to transmit the power of the engine to what is usually called the jack shaft."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872"&gt;Coleman Sellers, Transmission of Motion, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNgGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIV, No. 5 (Nov. 1872); pages 305-319, ''countershaft'' is defined on page 314, ''jack shaft'' on page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission], [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219-224, see particularly figure 1 and the discussion of it on pages 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills or power plants were frequently connected to the shaft with [[clutch]]es.  For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two [[Corliss engine]]s and five [[dynamo]]s, linked through a jackshaft.  Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed any or all of the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Flather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q5dKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=42 Rope-Driving:  A treatise on the transmission of power by means of fibrous ropes], Wiley, New York, 1895; pages 42-43. Fig. 21 shows part of the jack-shaft.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[Chain drive#Automobiles|chain-drive vehicles]], the term ''jackshaft'' was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth on the inside of the rims of the drive wheels,&lt;ref&gt;The Darling Steam Carriage, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IVMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316 The Horseless Age], Vol. 5, No. 2 (Oct. 11, 1899); page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some New American Steam Carriages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojofAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565 The Motor Car Journal], Vol I, No. 36 (Nov. 10, 1899); page 565.&lt;/ref&gt; or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.&lt;ref&gt;The Grout Steam Tonneau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J0eOQXpW6MEC&amp;pg=PA55 Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal] Vol II, No. 8 (Feb 1, 1902) ;pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the term ''jackshaft'' in the context of railroad equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower.  In his electric-motor driven [[railroad truck]], the motor was geared to a jackshaft mounted between the side frames.  A sliding [[Dog clutch]] inside the jackshaft was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Mower, Electric-Motor Mechanism, {{US patent|450970}}, issued Apr. 21, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using [[side rod]]s; see [[Jackshaft (locomotive)]] for details.
===Countershaft===
The term ''countershaft'' is somewhat older.  In 1828, the term was used to refer to an intermediate horizontal shaft in a [[gristmill]] driven through gearing by the [[waterwheel]] and driving the [[millstones]] through bevel gears.&lt;ref&gt;James Hindman and William Hindman, Improvement in the Grist Mill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaM1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 The American Journal of Improvements in the Useful Arts and Mirror of the Patent Office in the United States], Vol I, No. 3 (July, Aug. and Sept. 1828); page 324.  This reads like a patent application, there is no record of a corresponding patent.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a [[Belt drive|belt]] from the [[line shaft]] and driving the spindle of a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] through additional belts.  The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter [[pulley]]s for speed control.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Willis, Part the Third, Chapter II -- To Alter the Velocity Ratio by Determinate Changes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty84AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 Principles of Mechanism Designed for the Use of Students in the Universities and for Engineering Students Generally], John W. Parker, London, 1841; page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, this definition was given:  "The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line &lt;nowiki&gt;[shaft]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872" /&gt;
;Modern uses
Modern jackshafts and countershafts are often hidden inside large machinery as components of the larger overall device.

[[Image:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|thumb|A PTO Shaft or jackshaft with a protective shield to prevent entanglement.]]
In farm equipment, a spinning output shaft on the rear of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the ''[[power take-off|Power Take-Off]]'' or PTO, and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a ''PTO shaft'', but is also a jackshaft.

The '''Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World''' is an interdisciplinary center for research and teaching of [[archaeology]], particularly archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, at [[Brown University]].

==History==
The Joukowsky Institute was established in 2004, with a gift from Artemis Joukowsky, a former Chancellor of Brown University&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/portraits/display.php?idno=230 Brown Portrait Collection biography of Artemis A.W. Joukowsky]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martha Sharp Joukowsky]], a former associate professor of Anthropology at Brown. A new director, [[Susan E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16646">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions''', also known as the '''Kuhn–Tucker conditions''', are [[first-order condition|first derivative tests]] (sometimes called first-order) [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary conditions]] for a solution in [[nonlinear programming]] to be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]], provided that some [[#Regularity conditions (or constraint qualifications)|regularity condition]]s are satisfied. Allowing inequality constraints, the KKT approach to nonlinear programming generalizes the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which allows only equality constraints. The system of equations and inequalities corresponding to the KKT conditions is usually not solved directly, except in the few special cases where a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] solution can be derived analytically. In general, many optimization algorithms can be interpreted as methods for numerically solving the KKT system of equations and inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Vandenberghe|first2=Lieven|title=Convex Optimization|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge |year=2004|pages=244|isbn=0-521-83378-7|mr=2061575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKT conditions were originally named after [[Harold W. Kuhn]] and [[Albert W. Tucker]], who first published the conditions in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Nonlinear optimization problem ==

Consider the following nonlinear [[optimization problem|minimization or maximization problem]]:

:Optimize &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:subject to

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \leq 0, &lt;/math&gt; 
::&lt;math&gt; h_j(x) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the optimization variable, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[objective function|objective]] or [[utility]] function, &lt;math&gt; g_i \ (i = 1, \ldots, m) &lt;/math&gt; are the inequality [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] functions, and &lt;math&gt;h_j \ (j = 1,\ldots,\ell)&lt;/math&gt; are the equality constraint functions. The numbers of inequality and equality constraints are denoted &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

== Necessary conditions ==

Suppose that the [[objective function]] &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint functions &lt;math&gt;g_i : \,\!\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_j : \,\!\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are [[smooth function|continuously differentiable]] at a point &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local optimum]] and the optimization problem  satisfies some regularity conditions (see below), then there exist constants &lt;math&gt;\mu_i\ (i = 1,\ldots,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j\ (j = 1,\ldots,\ell)&lt;/math&gt;, called KKT multipliers, such that

[[File:Inequality constraint diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2|Inequality constraint diagram for optimization problems]]

;Stationarity
: For maximizing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x^*) = \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \nabla h_j(x^*),&lt;/math&gt;
: For minimizing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;-\nabla f(x^*) = \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \nabla h_j(x^*),&lt;/math&gt;

;Primal feasibility
:&lt;math&gt;g_i(x^*) \le 0, \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_j(x^*) = 0, \text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, \ell \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

;Dual feasibility
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i \ge 0, \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;

;Complementary slackness
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i g_i (x^*) = 0, \text{ for }\; i = 1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;

In the particular case &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., when there are no inequality constraints, the KKT conditions turn into the Lagrange conditions, and the KKT multipliers are called [[Lagrange multipliers]].

If some of the functions are non-differentiable, [[subderivative|subdifferential]] versions of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are available.&lt;ref&gt;

== Regularity conditions (or constraint qualifications) ==
In order for a minimum point &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the above KKT conditions, the problem should satisfy some regularity conditions; some common examples are tabulated here:

|}

It can be shown that

: LICQ ⇒ MFCQ ⇒ CPLD ⇒ QNCQ

and

: LICQ ⇒ CRCQ ⇒ CPLD ⇒ QNCQ

(and the converses are not true), although MFCQ is not equivalent to CRCQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice weaker constraint qualifications are preferred since they provide stronger optimality conditions.

== Sufficient conditions ==

In some cases, the necessary conditions are also sufficient for optimality. In general, the necessary conditions are not sufficient for optimality and additional information is necessary, such as the Second Order Sufficient Conditions (SOSC). For smooth functions, SOSC involve the second derivatives, which explains its name.

The necessary conditions are sufficient for optimality if the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a maximization problem is a [[concave function]], the inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; are continuously differentiable [[convex function]]s and the equality constraints &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[affine function]]s.

It was shown by Martin in 1985 that the broader class of functions in which KKT conditions guarantees global optimality are the so-called Type 1 '''[[invex function]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. H. |last=Martin |journal=J. Optim. Theory Appl. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=65–76 |title=The Essence of Invexity |year= 1985 |doi=10.1007/BF00941316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. A. |last=Hanson |title=Invexity and the Kuhn-Tucker Theorem |journal=J. Math. Anal. Appl. |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=594–604 |year=1999 |doi=10.1006/jmaa.1999.6484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-order sufficient conditions ===

For smooth, [[Nonlinear programming|non-linear optimization]] problems, a second order sufficient condition is given as follows.

The solution &lt;math&gt;x^*, \lambda^*, \mu^*&lt;/math&gt; found in the above section is a constrained local minimum if for the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt; L(x,\lambda,\mu) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j h_j(x) &lt;/math&gt;

then,

:&lt;math&gt;s^T\nabla ^2_{xx}L(x^*,\lambda^*,\mu^*)s \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is a vector satisfying the following,

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \nabla_x g_i(x^*),  \nabla_x h_j(x^*) \right]^T s = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where only those active inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;g_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to strict complementarity (i.e. where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;) are applied. The solution is a strict constrained local minimum in the case the inequality is also strict.

== Economics ==
{{see also|Profit maximization}}
Often in [[mathematical economics]] the KKT approach is used in theoretical models in order to obtain qualitative results. For example,&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C. ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', 3rd edition, 1984, pp. 750–752.&lt;/ref&gt; consider a firm that maximizes its sales revenue subject to a minimum profit constraint. Letting &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be the quantity of output produced (to be chosen), &lt;math&gt;R(Q)&lt;/math&gt; be sales revenue with a positive first derivative and with a zero value at zero output, &lt;math&gt;C(Q)&lt;/math&gt; be production costs with a positive first derivative and with a non-negative value at zero output, and &lt;math&gt;G_{\min}&lt;/math&gt; be the positive minimal acceptable level of [[Profit (economics)|profit]], then the problem is a meaningful one if the revenue function levels off so it eventually is less steep than the cost function.  The problem expressed in the previously given minimization form is

:Minimize &lt;math&gt; -R(Q)&lt;/math&gt; 
:subject to 
:&lt;math&gt; G_{\min} \le R(Q) - C(Q)  &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; Q \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and the KKT conditions are

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} \right) (1+\mu ) - \mu \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q} \right) \le 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; Q \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; Q \left[ \left( \frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} \right) (1+\mu ) - \mu \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q}\right) \right] = 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; R(Q) - C(Q) - G_{\min} \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; \mu \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; \mu [R(Q) - C(Q) - G_{\min}] = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;Q = 0&lt;/math&gt; would violate the minimum profit constraint, we have &lt;math&gt;Q &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and hence the third condition implies that the first condition holds with equality. Solving that equality gives

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} = \frac{\mu}{1+ \mu} \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Because it was given that &lt;math&gt;\text{d} R / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{d} C / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; are strictly positive, this inequality along with the non-negativity condition on &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is positive and so the revenue-maximizing firm operates at a level of output at which [[marginal revenue]] &lt;math&gt; \text{d} R / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; is less than [[marginal cost]] &lt;math&gt; \text{d} C / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; — a result that is of interest because it contrasts with the behavior of a [[profit maximization|profit maximizing]] firm, which operates at a level at which they are equal.

== Value function ==
If we reconsider the optimization problem as a maximization problem with constant inequality constraints:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Maximize }\; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{subject to }\ &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \le a_i , h_j(x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The value function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;V(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \sup\limits_x f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{subject to }\ &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \le a_i , h_j(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; j \in \{1,\ldots, \ell\}, i\in\{1,\ldots,m\},&lt;/math&gt;

so the domain of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{a \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \text{for some }x\in X, g_i(x) \leq a_i, i \in \{1,\ldots,m\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this definition, each coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the value function  increases as &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; increases.  Thus if each &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as a resource constraint, the coefficients tell you how much increasing a resource will increase the optimum value of our function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  This interpretation is especially important in economics and is used, for instance, in [[utility maximization problem]]s.

== Generalizations ==

With an extra multiplier &lt;math&gt;\mu_0\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, which may be zero (as long as &lt;math&gt;(\mu_0,\mu,\lambda)\neq0&lt;/math&gt;), in front of &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x^*)&lt;/math&gt; the KKT stationarity conditions turn into

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mu_0 \,\nabla f(x^*) + \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \,\nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \,\nabla h_j(x^*) = 0, \\[4pt]
&amp; \mu_jg_i(x^*)=0, \quad i=1,\dots,m,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which are called the [[Fritz John conditions]]. This optimality conditions holds without constraint qualifications and it is equivalent to the optimality condition ''KKT or (not-MFCQ)''.

The KKT conditions belong to a wider class of the first-order necessary conditions (FONC), which allow for non-smooth functions using [[subderivative]]s.

'''Leuckart's law''' is an [[empirical law]] in [[zoology]] that states that the size of the eye of an animal is related to its maximum speed of movement; fast-moving animals have larger eyes, after allowing for the effects of [[body mass]]. The hypothesis dates from 1876,&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; and in older literature is usually referred to as '''Leuckart's ratio'''.&lt;ref name=stew/&gt;

The principle was initially applied to birds; it has also been applied to mammals.&lt;ref name=heard/&gt;

==Criticism==
A study of 88 bird species, published in 2011, found no useful correlation between flight speed and eye size.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

A '''maid''', or '''housemaid''' or '''maidservant''', is a female [[domestic worker]]. Although now usually found only in the most wealthy of [[households]], in the [[Victorian era]] domestic service was the second largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/census.html|title=Occupations: census returns for 1851, 1861 and 1871|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in [[great house]]s, where the [[retinue]] of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler, responsible for female and male employees respectively. The word "maid" itself is short for "maiden", meaning a girl or unmarried young woman or virgin. Domestic workers, particularly those low in the hierarchy, such as maids and [[footmen]], were expected to remain unmarried while in service,&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essay XI''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; and even highest-ranking workers such as butlers could be dismissed for marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320949/Downstairs-Downton-Abbey-How-real-servants-worked-14-hour-days-maids-confined-virgin-quarters.html|title=Downstairs at Downton: How the real servants worked 14-hour days and the maids were confined to 'virgin quarters'|date=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victorian England, all middle class families would have "help", but for most small households, this would be only one employee, the maid of all work, often known colloquially as "the girl".

Historically many maids suffered from [[Prepatellar bursitis]], an inflammation of the [[Prepatellar bursa]] caused by long periods spent on the knees for purposes of scrubbing and fire-lighting, leading to the condition attracting the colloquial name of "Housemaid's Knee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://patient.info/health/housemaids-knee-prepatellar-bursitis|title = Housemaid's Knee (Prepatellar Bursitis)|work = Patient.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{See also|Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong}}

In the contemporary [[Western world]], comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help, usually relying on [[cleaner]]s, employed directly or through an agency ([[Maid service]]). Today a single maid may be the only [[domestic worker]] that upper-middle class households employ, as was historically the case. 

In less developed nations, various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work: very large differences in the income of urban and rural households, widespread poverty, fewer educated women, and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women.

Maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry, ironing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for household pets. They may also [[child care|take care of children]], although there are more specific occupations for this, such as [[nanny]]. In some poor countries, maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a [[uniform]].

Legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions, working hours, or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service. Nonetheless, the work of a maid has always been hard, involving a full day, and extensive duties.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} 

==Types==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds - George Clive and his Family with an Indian Maid - WGA19338.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Clive (died 1779)|George Clive]] and his family with an Indian maid, painted 1765. As she appears to be caring for the child, she may be an ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]''.]]
Maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households, and although there is overlap between definitions (dependent on the size of the household) the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to. The usual classifications of maid in a large household are:

* [[Lady's maid]]: a senior servant who reported directly to the [[lady]] of the house, but ranked beneath the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeeper]], and accompanied her lady on travel. She took care of her mistress's clothes and hair, and sometimes served as confidante. 
* House-maid or housemaid: a generic term for maids whose function was chiefly "above stairs", and were usually a little older, and better paid. Where a household included multiple housemaids the roles were often sub-divided as below.
** Head house-maid: the senior house maid, reporting to the Housekeeper. (Also called "House parlour maid" in an establishment with only one or two upstairs maids).
** Parlour maid: they cleaned and tidied reception rooms and living areas by morning, and often served refreshments at [[afternoon tea]], and sometimes also dinner. They tidied studies and libraries, and (with footmen) answered bells calling for service.&lt;ref&gt;A Parlour Maid's timetable is summarised [http://chestofbooks.com/food/household/Woman-Encyclopaedia-1/Parlourmaid-s-Time-Table.html in this webpage] extract from a book.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Chamber maid: they cleaned and maintained the bedrooms, ensured fires were lit in fireplaces, and supplied hot water.
** Laundry maid: they maintained bedding and towels. They also washed, dried, and ironed clothes for the whole household, including the servants.
** Under house parlour maid: the general deputy to the house parlour maid in a small establishment which had only two upstairs maids.
* [[Nursemaid|Nursery maid]]: also an "upstairs maid", but one who worked in the children's nursery, maintaining fires, cleanliness, and good order. Reported to the [[Nanny]] rather than the Housekeeper.
* [[Kitchen maid (domestic worker)|Kitchen maid]]: a "below stairs" maid who reported to the Cook, and assisted in running the kitchens.
** Head kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, the "head kitchen maid" was effectively a [[line cook|deputy to the cook]], engaged largely in the plainer and simpler cooking (sometimes cooking the servants' meals).
** Under kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed these were the staff who prepared vegetables, peeled potatoes, and assisted in presentation of finished cooking for serving.
* [[Scullery maid]]: the lowest grade of "below stairs" maid, reporting to the cook, the scullery maids were responsible for washing cutlery, crockery, and glassware, and scrubbing kitchen floors, as well as monitoring ovens while kitchen maids ate their own supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlifestyle.org/?cat=14|title=Victorian Life Style|work=victorianlifestyle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Between maid]]: roughly equivalent in status to scullery maids, and often paid less, the between maids in a large household waited on the senior servants ([[butler]], [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]]) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwardfamily.com/victorian_servants.htm|title=ourwardfamily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes known by the name 'tweeny'.
* [[Still room maid]]: a junior maid employed in the [[still room]]; as the work involved the supply of alcohol, cosmetics, medicines, and cooking ingredients across all departments of the house, the still room maids were part of the "between staff", jointly answerable to all three department heads.

In more modest households a single '''maid-of-all-work''' or '''skivvy''' was often the only staff. It is possible this word originates from the Italian for slave ("schiavo"—"owned person").

==In popular culture==
One of the most in-depth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', set in [[England]] between 1903 and 1936. Another representation of the lives of maids is seen nowadays in ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', set in England between 1912 and 1926.

==In Middle East countries==

Foreign women are employed in Middle East and African countries ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Somalia]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and others) in large numbers to work as maids and domestic servants and are often vulnerable to sexual abuse, violence and poor living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/07/07/if-i-am-not-human/abuses-against-asian-domestic-workers-saudi-arabia|title="As If I Am Not Human" - Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|date=7 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013| title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan maid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanrightswatch1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=printdoc&amp;amp;docid=412ef32a4| title='Bad Dreams:' Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date= 14 July 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minni ritchi''' is a type of reddish brown [[Bark (botany)|bark]] that continuously peels in small curly flakes, leaving the tree looking like it has a coat of red curly hair.  Brooker and Kleinig (1990) formally described it as a bark type in which "the outer rich, red-brown smooth bark splits both longitudinally and horizontally, the free edges rolling back without completely detaching to expose new green bark beneath".

A number of species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' have minni ritchi bark.  These include:
* ''[[Acacia curranii]]''
* ''[[Acacia cyperophylla]]'' (Creekline Miniritchie)
* ''[[Acacia gracillima]]''
* ''[[Acacia grasbyi]]'' (Miniritchie)
* ''[[Acacia monticola]]''
* ''[[Acacia rhodophloia]]''
* ''[[Acacia trachycarpa]]''
* ''[[Eucalyptus caesia]]'' (Gungurru, Silver Princess)
* ''[[Eucalyptus crucis]]''
* ''[[Eucalyptus orbifolia]]''

After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottomans and the following trends of Greek migration to the [[Greek diaspora|diaspora]], Greek architecture was concentrated mainly on the Greek Orthodox churches of Diaspora. These churches, such as other intellectual centres built by Greeks (foundations, schools, etc.), was used also as a meeting-place. The architectural style of these buildings was heavily influenced by the western European architecture.

After the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the creation of the modern Greek state, the modern Greek architecture tried to combine the traditional Greek architecture and Greek elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. 

The 19th-century architecture of [[Athens]] and other cities of the [[Greek Kingdom]] is mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]], with architects such as  [[Theophil Hansen]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Panagis Kalkos]] and [[Stamatios Kleanthis]].

==History==
[[File:Ακαδημία Αθηνών 5242-1.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Interior of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens.]]]]
The architecture of the modern Greek cities, especially the old centres ("old towns") is mostly influenced either by the [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] or the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architecture, two forces that dominated the Greek space from the [[early modern period]].

After the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.

Two special genres can be considered the [[Cycladic architecture]], featuring white-colour houses, in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Epirotic architecture]] in the region of [[Epirus]].

After the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], the [[architecture]] of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]]. For Athens, the first [[King of Greece]], [[Otto of Greece]], commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In 1917 most of [[Thessaloniki]]'s old center of the city was destroyed by the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]]. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton [[Thomas Mawson]], and headed by French architect [[Ernest Hébrard]].

In 1933 was signed the [[Athens Charter]], a manifesto of the modernist movement which published later by [[Le Corbusier]]. Architects of this movement were among others the [[Bauhaus]]-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Patroklos Karantinos]] and Takis Zenetos.

In 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about "horizontal property" made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of "αντιπαροχή" (''[[antiparochì]]'', literally "a supply in exchange"). With ''antiparochi'', the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the interwar period the practice of ''antiparochi'' was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, ''antiparochi'' became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoikìes) from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt; However this practice had the negative effect of the destruction of many old-era buildings and houses in the major Greek cities, just to be replaced by common appartment buildings.

After [[World War II]] and the [[Greek civil war]], the massive construction of [[condominium]]s in the major Greek city-centres was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first scycrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the [[OTE Tower]] and the [[Athens Tower 1|Athens Tower Complex]].

[[File:Acropolis Museum - Night.jpg|thumb|24ppx|The [[Acropolis Museum]]]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, ''[[Xenia (Hotel)|Xenia]]'' was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τουρισμού, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under [[Aris Konstantinidis]].
Famous foreign architects who have also designed buildings in Greece during the 20th and 21st century, include [[Walter Gropius]], [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Mario Botta]]. Several new buildings were also constructed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] for the 2004 [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]], while [[Bernard Tschumi]]  designed the [[New Acropolis Museum]]. Recently in 2012 [[Renzo Piano]] designed the [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center]] (completed in 2016).

In more general philosophical terms, normative science is a form of [[inquiry]], typically involving a community of inquiry and its accumulated body of provisional knowledge, that seeks to discover good ways of achieving recognized aims, ends, goals, objectives, or purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine, George H. (1912). [https://archive.org/details/jstor-2177252 Descriptive and normative sciences]. The Philosophical Review. 21(4): 433-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brueckner, Martin and Pierre Horwitz. (2005).

Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy. 1(2): 14-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many political debates revolve around arguments over which of the many "good ways" shall be selected.&lt;ref&gt;Short, T. L. (2012). [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/transactions_of_the_charles_s_peirce_society/v048/48.3.short01.html Normative science?] Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 48(3): 310-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when presented as scientific information, words such as [[ecosystem health]], [[biological integrity]], and [[environmental degradation]] are typically examples of normative science because they each presuppose a policy preference and are therefore a type of [[policy advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Wayne G. (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.5630030312/full The Exxon Valdez oil spill revisited and the dangers of normative science].

'''Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS)''' is a large-scale [[astronomical survey]] using the [[Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope]].

The survey is exploring the structure and content of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] (M31) and its neighbour, the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] (M33). Clues to the formation of these galaxies may lie within the vast space being studied. PAndAS is searching for this history, hence the term "[[galactic archaeology]]".

The project is headed by Dr. Alan McConnachie at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] (NRC-HIA), and involves over twenty five investigators from that institute, as well as from universities in Canada, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/projects/hia/pandas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230042604/http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/projects/hia/pandas.html |archivedate=2012-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''parallel force system''' is a situation in which two [[force]]s of equal magnitude act in the same direction [[Coplanarity|within the same plane]], with the counter force in the middle.  An example of this is a [[see saw]].  The children are applying the two forces at the ends, and the [[Lever|fulcrum]] in the middle gives the counter force to maintain the see saw in neutral position.  Another example are the major vertical forces on an [[airplane]] in flight (see image at right).

The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a group of over 70 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the phase out of traditional or unabated coal power.

==History==
The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

{{quotation
|
"Canada and the UK are right to kick-start the Alliance, as science tells us that OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BREAKING: 25 Jurisdictions Join Canada, UK in Coal Phaseout Alliance |url=https://theenergymix.com/2017/11/16/breaking-25-jurisdictions-join-canada-uk-in-coal-phaseout-alliance/ |accessdate=30 September 2018|date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openeduLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada &amp; UK launch coal phaseout plan |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/environmental-studies/canada-uk-launch-coal-phaseout-plan |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Membership has grown rapidly. By the end of the summit membership was over 20 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="abcnet20"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056 |accessdate=29 September 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month membership had grown to over 50 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance Membership Blows Out Past 50 |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/13/powering-past-coal-alliance-membership-blows-past-50/ |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018 membership stood at 74: 29 countries, 17 regions and 28 organisations.&lt;ref name="nrdc74"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Climate Action Summit: A World Moving Beyond Coal |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/global-climate-action-summit-world-moving-beyond-coal |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the South Korean province of [[South Chungcheong]] became the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korean province joins international coal phase-out club |url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/10/03/south-korean-province-joins-international-coal-phaseout-club/ |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrdsSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=Korean Province to Phase Out Coal: Implications for Asia |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/korean-province-phase-out-coal-implications-asia |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Alliance members agree that:&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50" /&gt;

* Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power.
* Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.
* Businesses/organisations will power operations without coal.
* Members will ensure policies and investments support clean power.
* Members will restrict financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage.

==Members==
Members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance at the start of October 2018 were:&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: Partners |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/powering-past-coal-alliance-declaration/powering-past-coal-alliance-partners |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnet20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong" /&gt;

Cited 2 Dec 2009 (UTC)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Defined]] anatomically, it is the area of the anterior chest wall over the [[heart]].  It is therefore usually on the left side, except in conditions like [[dextrocardia]], where the individual's heart is on the right side. In such a case, the precordium is on the right side as well.

The precordium is naturally a cardiac area of dullness. During [[Physical examination|examination]] of the chest, the percussion note will therefore be dull. In fact, this area only gives a resonant percussion note in [[Hyperaeration|hyperinflation]], [[emphysema]] or [[tension pneumothorax]]. 

Precordial chest pain can be an indication of a variety of illnesses, including [[costochondritis]] and viral [[pericarditis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38677">{{sexual orientation}}
The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain hormones plays a role in fetal [[sex differentiation]], such exposure also influences the [[sexual orientation]] that emerges later in the adult. '''Prenatal hormones''' may be seen as the primary determinant of adult sexual orientation, or a co-factor with genes, [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological factors]] and/or environmental and social conditions.

==Sex-typed behavior==

The hormonal theory of sexuality and gender identity holds that, just as exposure to certain [[hormones]] plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation and or gender identity that emerges later in the adult. Differences in brain structure that come about from chemical messengers and genes interacting on developing brain cells are believed to be the basis of sex differences in countless behaviors, including sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF.

Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions.&lt;ref name=BornGay&gt;Wilson, G., &amp; Q. Rahman, ''Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Human Sex Orientation'', Peter Owen Publishers; 2nd edition (May 1, 2008) {{ISBN|9780720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} However, Garcia-Falgueras and [[Dick Swaab]] disagree that social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree. As seen in young children as well as in vervet and rhesus monkeys, sexually differentiated behavior in toy preference is differing in males versus females, where females prefer dolls and males prefer toy balls and cars; these preferences can be seen as early as 3–8 months in humans.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  It is impossible to completely rule out the social environment or the child's cognitive understanding of gender when discussing sex typed play in androgen-exposed girls.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  Conversely, children tend towards objects which have been labelled for their own sex, or toys that they have seen members of their sex playing with previously.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;

An endocrinology study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab postulated that "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of {{sic}} sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|25}} Further, their study puts forward that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, the authors say that sexual organs are differentiated first, and then the brain is sexually differentiated "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well ... . The changes brought about in this stage are permanent. ... [S]exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, even though they are very important for gender identity and sexual orientation."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Organizational aspects===

Fetal gonads develop primarily based on the presence or absence of [[androgen]] hormones, mainly [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) and [[androstenedione]]; production of testosterone and conversion into dihydrotestosterone during weeks 6 to 12 of pregnancy are key factors in the production of a male fetus's penis, scrotum and prostate.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  In a female, on the other hand, absence of these levels of androgens results in development of typically female genitals.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Following this, sexual differentiation of the brain occurs; sex hormones exert organizational effects on the brain that will be activated in puberty.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bao|first=Ai-Min|author2=Dick F. Swaab|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: Relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|date=18 February 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=214–226|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.007|pmid=21334362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of these two processes occurring separately, the degree of genital masculinization does not necessarily relate to the masculinization of the brain.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Sex differences in the brain have been found in many structures, most notably the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt;  However, few of these have been related to behavioral sex differences, and scientists are still working to establish firm links between early hormones, brain development and behavior.&lt;ref name="Hines Review" /&gt; The study of the organizational theory of prenatal hormones can be difficult, as ethically researchers cannot alter hormones in a developing fetus; instead, scholars must rely on naturally occurring abnormalities of development to provide answers.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berenbaum|first=Sheri A.|author2=Adriene M.

Most extensively studied in organizational effects of hormones is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH).&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hines |first=Melissa |year=2011 |title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=170–182 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006 |pmid=21333673|pmc=3296090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CAH is a genetic disease that results in exposure to high levels of [[androgens]] beginning early in gestation.  Girls with CAH are born with masculinized genitalia, which is corrected surgically as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;  CAH provides the opportunity for [[natural experiments]], as people with CAH can be compared to people without it.  However, "CAH is not a perfect experiment", since, "social responses to masculinized genitalia or factors related to the disease itself" can [[confound]] results.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum/&gt;   Nonetheless several studies have shown that CAH has a clear but not determining influence on sexual orientation; women with CAH are less likely to be exclusively heterosexual than are other women.&lt;ref name=hinesrev2011/&gt;
  
Since hormones alone do not determine sexual orientation and differentiation of the brain, the search for other factors that act upon sexual orientation have led genes such as the [[SRY]] and ZFY to be implicated.&lt;ref name="Ngun et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngun|first=Tuck C. |author2=Negar Ghahramani |author3=Francisco J.

===Prenatal maternal stress===

As of 2006 results from studies in humans had found conflicting evidence regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to hormones and psychosexual outcomes; Gooren noted in 2006 that studies in subprimate mammals are invalid measures of human sexual differentiation, as sex hormones follow a more "on-off" role in sex-typed behavior than is found in primates.&lt;ref name=Gooren&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gooren|first=Louis|title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=November 2006|volume=50|issue=4|pages=589–601|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011|pmid=16870186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies do suggest that prenatal stress significantly increases the likelihood of [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]], although varying evidence exists for which trimester is most important.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}  Studies of endocrinology have found implications for amphetamines and thyroid-gland hormones to increase homosexuality in female offspring as well, although it has not been examined in conjunction with prenatal stress levels.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Some have postulated that postnatal (e.g., social and environmental factors) development can play a role in the sexual orientation of an individual, yet solid evidence of this has yet to be discovered. Children born through artificial insemination with donor sperm and consequently raised by lesbian couples have typically been heterosexually oriented.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt; Summed up by Bao and Swaab, "The apparent impossibility of getting someone to change their sexual orientation ... is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;

====Fraternal birth order====
According to some studies, gay men have more older [[brother]]s on average, a phenomenon known as the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]].  It has been suggested that the greater the number of older male siblings the higher the level of [[androgen]] fetuses are exposed to&lt;!--I think this is a reference to Williams et al. Nature paper, but I don't think it says quite says what this last sentence says--&gt;. No evidence of birth order effects have been observed in women. The theory holds that the fraternal birth order effect is a result of a maternal immune response that is produced towards a factor of male development over several male pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Bogaert's hypothesis argues that "the target of the immune response may be malespecific molecules on the surface of male fetal brain cells (e.g., including those in the anterior hypothalamus). Antimale antibodies might bind to these molecules and thus interfere with their role in normal sexual differentiation, leading some later born males to being attracted to men as opposed to women."&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that  "The ... fraternal birth order effect ... is putatively explained by an immunological response by the mother to a product of the Y chromosome of her sons. The chance of such an immune response to male factors would increase with every pregnancy resulting in the birth of a son."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}}

While direct support has not been found for these hypotheses, evidence that favours this theory exists.&lt;ref name="Blanchard/Lippa cite"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Ray|author2=Richard Lippa|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=April 2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–176|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birth Order, Sibling Sex Ratio, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation of Male and Female Participants in a BBC Internet Research Project|author1=Ray Blanchard|author2=Richard Lippa|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=163–76|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7|pmid=17345165}}&lt;/ref&gt;–48% per older brother, these odds really account for only a few percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect.

In conjunction with fraternal birth order, [[Handedness and sexual orientation|handedness]] provides further evidence of prenatal effects on sexual orientation, because handedness is regarded by many as a marker of early neurodevelopment. Other correlates to handedness (e.g., cerebral laterality, prenatal hormonal profiles, spatial ability) have been linked to sexual orientation, either empirically and/or theoretically.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;  In right-handed individuals, the number of older brothers increased the odds of homosexual orientation, but this effect was not seen in left-handed individuals.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt; As with other purported marks indicating higher incidence of homosexuality, however, the link with handedness remains ambiguous and several studies have been unable to replicate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=====Implicated genes in fraternal birth order=====

A gene of the ''Rh'' system has been discussed as a possible candidate for affecting fraternal birth order, as it has been linked to both handedness and immune system functioning.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaert|first=Anthony|author2=Ray Blanchard |author3=Lesley Crothswait |title=Interaction of Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in the Kinsey Interview Data|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=October 2007|volume=121|issue=5|pages=845–853|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.121.5.845|pmid=17907817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene variants in the ''Rh'' system are implicated in a maternal response to what is known as [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]]. ''Rh'' is a factor in blood, and in cases where the mother is absent of this (''Rh-'') while carrying an ''Rh+'' fetus, an immune response may develop with deleterious effects. The ''Rh'' gene hypothesis is a strong candidate because not only does it involve the maternal immune response, but it has been implicated in handedness as well.&lt;ref name="Kinsey data" /&gt;

Variants of the androgen receptor (''AR'') gene have also been discussed, in that non-right-handedness in men has been linked with greater CAG repeats in the ''AR'' gene, which in turn is associated with lower testosterone. A theory that high prenatal testosterone leads to neuronal and axonal loss in the corpus callosum is supported by this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Witelson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra|author2=R.

===Male homosexuality as hypomasculine===
{{main|Hypomasculinity}}

In a 1991 study, [[Simon LeVay]] demonstrated that a tiny clump &lt;!--name that 'clump' (&amp; call it a nucleus) --&gt; of neurons of the anterior [[hypothalamus]]—which is believed to control sexual behavior and linked to prenatal hormones—known as the interstitial nuclei of the anterior was, on average, more than twice the size in heterosexual men when contrasted to homosexual men. Due to this area also being nearly twice the size in heterosexual men than in heterosexual women, the implication is that the sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus in homosexuals is in a female direction.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  In 2003 scientists at [[Oregon State University]] announced that they had replicated his findings in sheep. Later studies in humans, however, have yet to confirm this finding.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt; &lt;!-- I believe this has also been replicated in human subjects: Byne, W., S. Tobet, ''et al.'' (2001). "The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and hiv status." Horm Behav 40(2): 86–92. Dr. Simon LeVay, in his study of the hypothalamic differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men, offered the following criticisms of his own research, "It's important to stress what I didn't find. I did not prove that homosexuality is genetic, or find a genetic cause for being gay. I didn't show that gay men are born that way, the most common mistake people make in interpreting my work. Nor did I locate a gay center in the brain."--&gt;

===Female homosexuality===

Most empirical or theoretical research into women's sexual orientation has, historically, been guided by the idea of lesbians as essentially masculine and heterosexual women as essentially feminine.&lt;ref name=Peplau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peplau|first=Letitia|author2=Mark Huppin|title=Masculinity, Femininity and the Development of Sexual Orientation in Women|journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health|date=October 2008|volume=12|issue=1–2|pages=145–165|doi=10.1300/J529v12n01_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, this belief is traced to the early "inversion theory" of sex researchers who state that homosexuality is a result of biological abnormalities that "invert" sexual attraction and personality.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;  Handedness research has provided implications; because more men than women present a preference for their left hand, the higher proportion of non-right handedness that has been discovered among lesbians when compared to heterosexual women demonstrates a possible link of prenatal masculinization and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt; Backing this up are reports that lesbians display more masculinized 2D;4D digit ratios than heterosexual women, based on data gathered from at least six different laboratories.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins" /&gt;  This effect has not yet been observed between homosexual and heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2d4d twins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobrogge|first=Kyle L|author2=S.

these findings,&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  leaving the validity of this measure unconfirmed.

[[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), a drug that has been in the past prescribed to prevent miscarriages, has also been studied in relation to women's sexual orientation.

However, the degree to which the girls' genitals are masculinized does not correlate with their sexual orientation, suggesting that prenatal hormones are a stronger causal factor, not parental influence.

Together with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, DES studies have provided little support of the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation; they do, however, provide the framework for possible pathways to a homosexual orientation for a small number of women.&lt;ref name="Peplau" /&gt;

===Gender dysphoria===
{{main|Gender dysphoria}}

In individuals with [[gender dysphoria]], previously known as gender identity disorder (GID), prenatal exposure to testosterone has been hypothesized to have an effect on gender identity differentiation. The 2D;4D finger ratio, or relative lengths of the 2nd "index" and 4th "ring" fingers, has become a popular measure of prenatal androgen because of accumulated evidence suggesting the 2D;4D ratios are related to prenatal exposure to testosterone.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallien|first=Madeleine|author2=Kenneth J. Zucker |author3=Thomas D. Steensma |author4=Peggy T. Cohen-Kettenis |title=2D:4D finger-length ratios in children and adults with gender identity disorder|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=August 2008|volume=54|issue=3|pages=450–454|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.05.002|pmid=18585715}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many children with GID differentiate a homosexual orientation during adolescence, but not all of them; adults with "early onset", or a childhood history of cross-gender behavior, often have a homosexual orientation. Adults with "late onset", or those without a childhood history of said behavior, are more likely to have a non-homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="2d4d wallien"/&gt;

Prenatal androgen exposure has  been associated with an increased chance of patient-initiated [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment]] to male after being initially raised as female in early childhood or infancy.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer-Bahlburg 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Bahlburg|first=Heino|title=gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile albation|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=28 August 2005|volume=34|issue=4|pages=423–438|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gooren found that organizational effects of prenatal androgens are more prevalent in gender role behavior than in gender identity, and that there are preliminary findings that suggest evidence of a male gender identity being more frequent in patients with fully male-typical prenatal androgenization.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Individuals with complete [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] are almost always brought up as females, and the differentiation of gender identity/role is feminine.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;   This example is important in demonstrating that chromosomes and gonads alone do not dictate gender identity and role.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

====Transsexualism====
{{main|Transsexualism}}

Because organ differentiation and brain differentiation occur at different times, in rare cases transsexualism can result.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|24}} Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in transsexuality in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Sexual Differentiation of the Brain" /&gt;  
 
Drawing on some transsexualism cases, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state that "[f]rom these examples it appears that the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation ... ."&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;{{rp|26}} Countless studies have been run on peripheral levels of sex steroids in male and female homosexuals, a considerable number of which claimed to find "less 'male hormone' and/or more 'female hormone' in male homosexuals and vice versa in female homosexuals".&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  However, these findings have been reviewed and have subsequently been dismissed by scholars as suffering from faulty design and interpretation.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Factors implicated in the development of transsexuality include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in [[aromatase]] (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and [[CYP17]].&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of transsexuality later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;  These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of transsexualism and homosexuality exists.&lt;ref name=Gooren /&gt;

Due to relatively small population sizes, generalizability of studies on transsexuality cannot be assumed.

==Endocrine disruptors==

[[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerant]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] are algorithms that are robust to arbitrary types of failures in [[distributed algorithms]]. With the advent and popularity of the [[Internet]], there is a need to develop algorithms that do not require any centralized control that have some guarantee of always working correctly.{{OR|date=July 2016}} The Byzantine agreement protocol is an essential part of this task. In this article the quantum version of the Byzantine protocol,&lt;ref name="Ben-Or"&gt;Michael Ben-Or and Avinatan Hassidim,
Fast quantum byzantine agreement,STOC '05: Proceedings of the thirty-seventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,
pg 481-485 [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; which works in constant time is described.

==Introduction==
The [[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine Agreement]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]] is a protocol in [[distributed computing]].
It takes its name from a problem formulated by Lamport, Shostak and Pease in 1982,&lt;ref name="Lamport:1982"&gt;L. Lamport and R. Shostak and M. Pease, 
The [[Byzantine]] Generals Problem, ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst., volume 4, number 3, pg 382-401 [1982]&lt;/ref&gt; which itself is a reference to a historical problem.  The Byzantine army was divided into divisions with each division being led by a General with the following properties:

*Each General is either loyal or a traitor to the [[Byzantine|Byzantine state]].
*All Generals communicate by sending and receiving messages.
*There are only two commands: attack and retreat.
*All loyal Generals should agree on the same plan of action: attack or retreat.
*A small linear fraction of bad Generals should not cause the protocol to fail (less than a &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; fraction).
(See &lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;Michael J. Fisher, Nancy  A. Lynch,Michael S. Paterson,Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process, Journal of the ACM volume 32, issue=2, pg 374-382 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3149.214121 Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process][1985]&lt;/ref&gt; for the proof of the impossibility result). 
The problem usually is equivalently restated in the form of a commanding General and loyal Lieutenants with the General being either loyal or a traitor and the same for the Lieutenants with the following properties.

*All loyal Lieutenants carry out the same order.
*If the commanding General is loyal, all loyal Lieutenants obey the order that he sends.
*A strictly less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; fraction including the commanding General are traitors.

==Byzantine Failure and Resilience==
Failures in an [[algorithm]] or [[Communications protocol|protocol]] can be categorized into three main types:
# A failure to take another execution step in the algorithm: This is usually referred to as a "fail stop" fault.
# A random failure to execute correctly: This is called a "random fault" or "random Byzantine" fault.
# An arbitrary failure where the algorithm fails to execute the steps correctly (usually in a clever way by some adversary to make the whole algorithm fail) which also encompasses the previous two types of faults; this is called a "Byzantine fault".

A Byzantine resilient or [[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerant]] protocol or algorithm is an algorithm that is robust to all the kinds of failures mentioned above. For example, given a space shuttle with multiple redundant processors and some of the processors give incorrect data, which processors or sets of processors should be believed? The solution can be formulated as a [[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerant]] protocol.

==Sketch of the Algorithm==
We will sketch here the asynchronous algorithm &lt;ref name="Ben-Or"/&gt;
The algorithm works in two phases:
*Phase 1 (Communication phase):
:All messages are sent and received in this round.
:A coin flipping protocol is a procedure that allows two parties A and B that do not trust each other to toss a coin to win a particular object.
There are two types of coin flipping protocols
** [[Quantum Coin Flipping|weak coin flipping]] protocols:&lt;ref name="wiki:tossing"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206121v2  I. Kerenidis, A. Nayak, coin flipping with small bias, arxiv]&lt;/ref&gt; The two players A and B initially start with no inputs and they are to compute some value &lt;math&gt;c_{A},c_{B} \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and be able to accuse anyone of cheating. The protocol is successful if A and B agree on the outcome. The outcome 0 is defined as A winning and 1 as B winning. The protocol has the following properties:
***If both players are honest (they follow the protocol), then they agree on the outcome of the protocol &lt;math&gt; c_{A} = c_{B}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = b) = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; a,b \in \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
***If one of the players is honest (i.e., the other player may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol in his or her local computation), then the other party wins with probability at most &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if B is dishonest, then &lt;math&gt;Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = 1) \leq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and if A is dishonest, then &lt;math&gt;Pr(c_{A} = c_{B} = 0)\leq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.
** A [[Quantum Coin Flipping|strong coin flipping protocol]]: In a strong coin flipping protocol, the goal is instead to produce a random bit which is biased away from any particular value 0 or 1. Clearly, any strong coin flipping protocol with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; leads to weak coin flipping with the same bias.

===Verifiable secret sharing.===
* A [[verifiable secret sharing]] (VSS) protocol:&lt;ref name="wiki:VSS"&gt;Verifiable secret sharing [[verifiable secret sharing]]&lt;/ref&gt; A (n,k) [[secret sharing]] protocol allows a set of n players to share a secret, ''s'' such that only a quorum of k or more players can discover the secret. The player sharing (distributing the secret pieces) the secret is usually referred to as the dealer. A verifiable secret sharing protocol differs from a basic secret sharing protocol in that players can verify that their shares are consistent even in the presence of a malicious dealer.

===The Fail-stop protocol.===

====Protocol QuantumCoinFlip for player &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;====
#Round 1 generate the state &lt;math&gt;|Coin_i\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0,0,\ldots,0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|1,1,\ldots,1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; on n [[qubits]] and send the kth [[qubit]] to the kth player keeping one part
# Generate the state &lt;math&gt;|Leader_i\rangle= \frac{1}{n^{3/2}}\sum _{a=1}^{n^3}|a,a,\ldots,a\rangle&lt;/math&gt; on ''n'' qubits, an equal superposition of the numbers between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt;.Distribute the ''n'' [[qubits]] between all the players
# Receive the quantum messages from all players and wait for the next communication round, thus forcing the adversary to choose which messages were passed.
# Round 2: Measure (in the standard base) all &lt;math&gt;Leader_{j}&lt;/math&gt; [[qubits]] received in round I. Select the player with the highest leader value (ties broken arbitrarily) as the "leader" of the round. Measure the leader’s coin in the standard base.
# Set the output of the QuantumCoinFlip protocol: &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; = measurement outcome of the leader’s coin.

===The Byzantine protocol.===
To generate a random coin assign an integer in the range [0,n-1] to each player and each player is not allowed to choose its own 
random ID as each player &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; selects a random number &lt;math&gt;s{_{k}^{i}}&lt;/math&gt; for every other player &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and distributes  this using a verifiable secret sharing scheme.

At the end of this phase players agree on which secrets were properly shared, the secrets are then opened and each player &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is assigned the  value &lt;math&gt;s_i =\sum \, {s_{k}^{i}}{\text{for all secrets properly shared}}\mod n&lt;/math&gt;
This requires private information channels so we replace the random secrets by the superposition &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{a=0}^{n-1}|a\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. In which the state is encoded using a quantum verifiable secret sharing protocol (QVSS).&lt;ref name="wiki:QVSS"&gt;Claude Cr´epeau, Daniel Gottesman and Adam Smith, Secure Multi-party Quantum Computation, In 34th ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, STOC, pg. 643–652, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; We cannot distribute the state &lt;math&gt;|\phi,\phi,\ldots \phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; since the bad players can collapse the state. To prevent bad players from doing so we encode the state using the Quantum verifiable secret sharing (QVSS) and send each player their share of the secret. Here again the verification requires Byzantine Agreement, but replacing the agreement by the grade-cast protocol is enough.&lt;ref name="wiki:byzantine"&gt;Michael Ben-Or, Elan Pavlov, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Byzantine Agreement in the Full-Information Model in O(log n) Rounds, STOC '06: Proceedings of the thirty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,
pg 179-186 [2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiki:prob"&gt;Pesech Feldman and Silvio Micali. An optimal probabilistic protocol for synchronous byzantine agreement. SIAM J. Comput., pg 873–933, [1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grade-cast protocol====
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Broadcast.PNG|thumb|right|broadcast from dealer to players]] --&gt;
A grade-cast protocol has the following properties using the definitions in &lt;ref name="wiki:byzantine"/&gt;
Informally, a graded [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] protocol is a protocol with a designated player called “dealer” (the one who broadcasts) such that:
# If the dealer is good, all the players get the same message.
# Even if the dealer is bad, if some good player accepts the message, all the good players get the same message (but they may or may not accept it).
A protocol P is said to be achieve graded [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] if, at the beginning of the protocol, a designated player D (called the dealer) holds a value v, and at the end of the protocol, every player &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; outputs a pair &lt;math&gt;(value_{i}, confidence_{i})
&lt;/math&gt; such that the following properties hold: 
&lt;math&gt;(\forall i, confidence_{i} \in \{0, 1, 2\})&lt;/math&gt;
#If D is honest, then &lt;math&gt;value_{i}&lt;/math&gt; = v and &lt;math&gt;confidence_{i}&lt;/math&gt; = 2 for every honest player &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;.
# For any two honest players &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P_{j},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vert confidence_{i} - confidence_{j}\vert \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
# (Consistency) For any two honest players &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;confidence_{i}&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; confidence_{j}&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,then &lt;math&gt; value_{i}= value_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;t &lt; \frac{n}{4}&lt;/math&gt; the verification stage of the QVSS protocol guarantees that for a good dealer the correct state will be encoded, and that for any, possibly faulty dealer, some particular state will be recovered during the recovery stage. We note that for the purpose of our Byzantine quantum coin flip protocol the recovery stage is much simpler. Each player measures his share of the QVSS and sends the classical value to all other players. The verification stage guarantees, with high probability, that in the presence of up to &lt;math&gt;t &lt; \frac{n}{4}&lt;/math&gt; faulty players all the good players will recover the same classical value (which is the same value that would result from a direct measurement of the encoded state).

== Remarks ==
In 2007, a quantum protocol for Byzantine Agreement was demonstrated experimentally &lt;ref name="wiki:byzexperiment"&gt;Sascha Gaertner, Mohamed Bourennane, Christian Kurtsiefer, Adán Cabello, Harald Weinfurter, Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum Protocol for Byzantine Agreement and Liar Detection, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.0290v2 arXiv:0710.0290v2], [2007], [http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.070504 Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 070504].&lt;/ref&gt; using a four-photon polarization-entangled state. This shows that the quantum implementation of classical Byzantine Agreement protocols is indeed feasible.

The word was coined by Jake Kotze in August 2006.&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Synchromysticism has been described as a phenomenon "existing on the fringe of areas already considered fringe".&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sutcliff and Carole Cusack describe synchromysticism as "part artistic practice, part spiritual or metaphysical system, part conspiracy culture",&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[[#refSutcliffe|Sutcliffe, Steven &amp; Cusack, Carole. ''The Problem of Invented Religions'']]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jason Horsley]] describes it as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precursors and concept == 

'''Synchronicity''' is a concept first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle", "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mysticism''', in turn, has been loosely defined as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} James popularized this use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}} Religious experiences belong to the "personal religion", which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}}

'''Synchromysticism''', as the union of synchronicity and mysticism, is thus the sense of interconnectedness and oneness with reality that comes from a heightened and enhanced awareness of synchronicity.&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;[[#refValis|Valis. ''The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism'']]&lt;/ref&gt; A form of "postmodern animism", Horsley argues that synchromysticism "underlines a common theme beneath three apparently disparate areas: that of the religious quest for meaning or 'signs,' the [[shamanism|shamanic]]/[[animism|animistic]] relationship with Nature, and the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic's]] inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;[[#refHorsley|Horsley, Jason. ''The Secret Life of Movies'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Within chaos magic ==

[[Chaos magic]] as a contemporary [[Magic (paranormal)|magical practice]] consisting of "techniques" (most frequently, entering into an [[altered state of consciousness]] and manipulating [[Sigil (magic)|symbols]]) to attain objective "results" in physical reality.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;[[#refChryssides|Chryssides, George. ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;[[#refDrury|Drury, Nevill. ''The Watkins Dictionary of Magic'']]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were explicit in stating that these "results" take the form of synchronicities, with [[Peter J. Carroll]] stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978):

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for deliberately engineering synchronicities.&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;[[#refCarroll2|Carroll, Peter J. ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'']]&lt;/ref&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;[[#refCarroll4|Carroll, Peter J. ''Octavo'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1&gt;[[#refWhite1|White, Gordon. ''Pieces of Eight'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;[[#refWhite6|White, Gordon. ''Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biosphere Rules is a framework for implementing closed loop production in business. They emerged from a 2005 research project at [[IE Business School]] that identified the principles that facilitate circular processes in nature but interpreted for&amp;mdash;and translated to&amp;mdash;industrial production systems. The research indicated that adopting the principles allowed businesses to establish economically and environmentally sustainable [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed-loop]] manufacturing systems.

The five principles that constitute the Biosphere Rules are briefly:

'''1. Materials parsimony.'''

Minimize the types of materials used in products with a focus on materials that are life-friendly and economically recyclable.

'''2. Value cycle.'''

Recover and reincarnate materials from end-of-use goods into new value-added products.

'''3. Power autonomy.'''

Maximize the power autonomy of products and processes so they can function on renewable energy.

'''4. Sustainable product platforms.'''

Leverage value cycles as product platforms for profitable scale, scope, and knowledge economies.

'''5. Function over form.'''

Fulfill customers’ functional needs in ways that sustain the value cycle.

This [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] framework contends that these principles facilitate the transition of human manufacturing systems business towards a functioning circular economy.

== Origins ==
The Biosphere Rules emerged from a research program established through a 2005 partnership between the renowned eco-designer William McDonough and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206061342/http://www.ceim.ie.edu/ Center for Eco-Intelligent Management] at [http://www.ie.edu/business-school/ IE Business School], a top-ranked European management institute.  The research program identified the attributes of natural systems that allowed for the closed-loop production of organisms in the biosphere. These attributes were then used as a framework for analyzing concrete company examples in the program’s second phase.  Case studies of first mover companies adopting [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed loop]] or [[cradle-to-cradle design]] for product development found common elements that made closed-loop systems viable in a business context. Importantly, the identified elements were similar to the principles seen in natural systems, mapped onto human manufacturing approaches.

The principles were first published in the February 2008 issue the [[Harvard Business Review]] in an article entitled “The Biosphere Rules.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|year=2008|title=The Biosphere Rules|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=86.2|pages=111–117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later expanded upon in a book entitled “Earth, Inc.: Using Nature’s Rules to Build Sustainable Profits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth, Inc.: Using nature's rules to build sustainable profits|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2013|isbn=1422127176|location=USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010 by the Harvard Business School Press.

== The Five Biosphere Rules ==

'''Rule #1: Materials Parsimony'''

The Materials Parsimony rule deals with constraining the number of '''types''' of materials used in product design and manufacturing. This is not to be confused with the sustainable business strategy of [[eco-efficiency]] which seeks to reduce the '''amount''' of materials used in production.

The parsimony rule comes instead from applying a biomimicry perspective to materials in the biosphere. The [[Periodic table|Periodic Table of the Elements]] encompass the 88 naturally occurring elements from arsenic to xenon. Yet despite this diversity of options, the biosphere relies on four elements—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen ([[CHON]])—as the foundation of every living thing on earth. Adding trace amounts of sulfur, phosphorus and calcium we can account for the weight of 99 percent of every living thing on the planet. Parsimony in the biosphere makes it possible break down an organism like a rabbit locally and reassemble its constituent materials into a tree, mushroom or even another rabbit.

The functional benefit of materials parsimony for circular economy is that it dramatically simplifies the logistics and transaction costs of recycling, while producing scale economies through supply concentration.  Applying the Materials Parsimony rule to industry requires simplifying of the number and types of materials used in products. While expecting business to use the same four elements as nature is currently impractical, businesses can dramatically reduce the number of materials employed in manufacture, with a small number doing the yeoman’s work. For special isolated applications, a smaller set of select materials could be reserved and designed to be easily separated from the bulk of the product.  By making these choices, business could absorb a large percent of production within a [[Circular economy|circular materials economy]].

A first step towards materials parsimony that some companies are using is the materials sourcing strategy known as “green screening,” which seeks to exclude potentially hazardous materials from products. Limiting the “materials palette” to environmentally benign inputs at the design stage makes dealing with product and process waste much easier. It also can have the effect of dramatically reducing the number of materials in the product designer’s pallet. Beyond green screening, the emerging strategy of uni-materialization or monomateriality takes the material parsimony approach to its logical extreme by seeking to design products from a single material.

'''Rule #2: Value Cycling'''

The second principle - Value Cycling - refers to the actual cyclical reuse of materials from one high value use to another. It is called a “value cycle” to differentiate from the “[[value chain]]” model that is typical of current production approaches, whereby raw materials are converted into products and then into waste in a linear stepwise process.

In the biosphere, value cycling occurs at the atomic and molecular levels. The same materials that compose a leaf can be decomposed and incorporated into a new tree, a worm or other organisms. Technological limitations generally constrain human manufacturing system’s ability to mimic natural molecular cycling, but the approach can be applied analogously at different levels. Materials in products can be value cycled in “shallow loops” or “deep loops”.

With “shallow-loop” cycling, manufacturers adopt recycling at the “components level” through the [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]],  refurbishment or reuse of product parts and components. In contrast, “deep-loop” recycling refers to the regeneration at the material level. Currently a limited number of materials can be deep-loop value cycled, such as metals, glass and some plastics. As [[green chemistry]] research results in new polymers that can be recycled at the materials level, greater adoption of deep-loop value cycling approaches can be implemented.

'''Rule #3: Power Autonomy'''

Every transformation of materials in nature - from turtle to tree - requires energy. In nature, the energy source is solar power captured biologically through [[photosynthesis]]. A tree’s captured energy can then be transferred throughout ecosystems through the [[Trophic level|trophic pyramid]] to herbivores and carnivores. Plants and animals also have inherent biological processes that absorb energy and store it in chemical form for later use. [[Solar energy]] therefore serves as the basis of the biosphere’s transformations of material.

Human manufacturing, in contrast, has relied primarily on [[fossil fuel]]s like oil, gas and coal to extract and transform materials. Fossil fuels cannot be considered a sustainable energy solution for many reasons, including the fact that they are finite and their exploitation is reversing important planetary biogeochemical processes producing unwanted climatic and ecosystem impacts. The power autonomy rule applied to human manufacturing requires that products and production processes run on solar-motivated renewable energy sources as in the biosphere.

The power autonomy approach sees this occurring in a two step process.  The first step is to increase the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] products and production processes. As energy efficiency increases new options for generation and energy storage open up because less total energy is needed. The [[renewable energy]] technologies and energy storage technologies can be adopted that move the business towards a state of autonomous power generation.

Power autonomy can be seen from a [[fractal]] perspective in that it can occur at many levels. Power autonomy at the product level would be implemented by designing products that can capture and store their own energy. At the corporate level, a power autonomous company could be one that generates all its energy use from renewable sources. And power autonomy can be considered at the city or state level as in the concept of [[United States energy independence|energy independence]].

'''Rule #4: Sustainable Product Platforms'''

It is estimated that there 8.7 million [[Global biodiversity|species]] on the planet, yet all this diversity is built upon a single materials and energy platform consisting of a solar powered value cycle and a parsimonious materials pallet (CHON).   Nature’s platform allows economies of scale, scope and knowledge that drive the proliferation of species into every habitable niche on the planet. [[Economies of scale|Scale economies]] occur through reproduction and the duplicative growth of species population. [[Economies of scope|Scope economies]], on the other hand, come through speciation, the evolutionary emergence of new species, based on the same platform as individual species. Finally, knowledge economies arise through the accumulative encoding, refining and sharing of survival information genetically overtime in DNA.

The Sustainable Production Platform principle allows businesses to emulate nature’s platform approach in manufacturing and generate similar economies. A sustainable product platform consists of a parsimonious materials palette and associated processing technologies that are assembled into a power autonomous value cycle that is flexible enough to produce a wide variety of products. If managers only use this system to produce a single product, the realized increasing returns would come solely from scale economies (spreading the fixed costs over an increasing unit output). Henry Ford exploited economies of scale by efficiently [[Mass production|mass-producing]] a single car, the Model-T. But by treating the materials-process combination as a fundamental design platform and leveraging it across an entire family of products, managers can foster the scale, scope, and knowledge economies that will continually optimize the value cycle and build larger and more durable returns for their business and society.  In the 1920s, General Motors began exploiting an economy of scope by offering a variety of vehicle designs and brands built on a single automobile design platform.

Sustainable Product Platforms can be built across a spectrum of governance options. At one end manufacturers can [[Vertical integration|vertically integrate]] all the stages of the value cycle retaining full ownership of their materials and product components. At the other extreme, value cycles can be completely open source where materials are value cycled through market forces. This is the case for most commodity recycling today such as steel and aluminum.

'''Rule #5: Function Over Form'''

Throughout the geological record, there is evidence of nature’s constant evolutionary experimentation with life forms. Over billions of years, nature has produced innumerable species in an effort to take advantage of every ecological opportunity. But despite this evident diversity of forms, there are clear patterns in the ecological functions organisms fulfill.  Classes of organisms – producers, predators, pollinators, parasites – serve specific ecosystem functions. The form and its function are encoded in the genes of species, which allow the distributed local manufacturing of organisms necessary to fulfill needed ecosystem functions within the context of a globally integrated system.

In contrast, human manufacturing has tended to emphasize the commercialization of a specific product form rather than the underlying function that the product is intended to serve. Implementing the Biosphere Rules requires that engineers to shift design thinking towards providing a desired function, using the capabilities of the sustainable product platform as a design constraint on form. This approach logically leads to [[Service economy|servicization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothenberg|first=Sandra|year=2007|title=Sustainability through servicizing|url=|journal=MIT Sloan management review|volume=48.2|pages=83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and product of service strategies.

== Implementation ==
Implementing the Biosphere Rules at an established company require longterm strategic commitments and investment and there are many organizational and other barriers to adopting circular economy practices. The Biosphere Rules, however, were designed in a modular fashion that allows for stepwise implementation. A company can take action to review its input sourcing decisions and move towards greater materials parsimony without having to implement all the other rules simultaneously. Other rules can be implemented in a similar sequential manner which eases the disruption to existing systems and helps facilitate a smooth transition towards a circular business model. However, the ultimate goal is an integrated sustainable business system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''Transnational history''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at how developments within the history of one [[country]] have been shaped by developments outside of this country, e.g. how [[History of the British Isles|British history]] has been shaped by developments coming from [[France]], [[Germany]] or [[the US]]. The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when [[Ian Tyrrell]] pioneered this approach but it was in the field of [[American Studies]], in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. 

As the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historian]] Nils Arne Sørensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to reject the [[nation state]] as the "natural" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement was on the rise in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Arne Sørensen (2009) "[https://tidsskrift.dk/historisktidsskrift/article/view/56424/76630 Den transnationale vending?]"i ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' Volume 109, Issue 2: 459-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the "connections and circulations" between societies in the [[modern age]].&lt;ref&gt;Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier (2009) ''Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the [[Annales school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell (2008) [https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/what-is-transnational-history/ "What is transnational history?"] ''Ian Tyrell'' (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of New Hampshire''' ('''UNH''') is a [[public research university]] in the [[University System of New Hampshire]], in the United States. The university's [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] campus, comprising six colleges, is located in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast region]] of the state. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], known as the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] until 2010, is located in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital.

The University of New Hampshire was founded and incorporated in 1866, as a [[land grant college]]  in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]]. In 1893, UNH moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]].

With over 15,000 students between its Durham, Manchester, and Concord campuses, UNH is the largest university in the state. UNH is one of only a few universities that is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. The university's current President is [[James W. Dean Jr.]], the 20th President of the University, who took over from [[Mark Huddleston]] on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2018/04/04/james-w-dean-jr-named-20th-president-university-new-hampshire|title=James W.

== History ==
[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] 
[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]
[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]
The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the '''[[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]]''' in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891 Gov. Hiram Americus Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Gov. Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow &amp; Randlett]].

In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.

In 1923, Gov. Fred Herbert Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''.

In the spring of 2015, the university was given $4 million from the estate of [[Robert Morin (librarian)|Robert Morin]], who had been a librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2016/08/30/long-time-librarian-surprises-unh-4-million-gift|title=Long-Time Librarian Surprises UNH with $4 Million Gift|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/15/494134464/-1-million-of-frugal-librarians-bequest-to-n-h-school-goes-to-football-scoreboar|title=$1 Million Of Frugal Librarian's Bequest To N.H.

The university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.

The Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.

The coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].

The [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.

There are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).

The university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs. As of fall 2004, there were 561 students (4 percent of the student body) studying in 38 different countries. The university runs/manages 22 study abroad programs in locations which include [[Cambridge]], England; [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Brest, France]]; [[Dijon]], France; [[Grenoble]], France; [[Budapest]], Hungary; [[Osaka]], Japan; [[Utrecht]], Netherlands; [[Maastricht]], Netherlands; [[Ascoli Piceno]], Italy; New Zealand; India; South Africa; Kenya; and [[Granada]], Spain. The university also accepts credit from over 300 approved programs that are run through other institutions.  The university organizes an annual summer abroad program at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  There are also over 100 National Exchange Program opportunities.

In 2010, the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] was incorporated into the University of New Hampshire System and renamed the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]. It is the only law school in the state of New Hampshire. The School of Law offers Juris Doctor degrees in addition to graduate studies in Intellectual Property and Commerce &amp; Technology. The University of New Hampshire Law School is renowned for its intellectual property law programs, consistently ranking in the top ten of U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings.  In 2012, it was ranked 4th behind University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and George Washington University.

The [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics]] building was opened for occupancy in January 2013.&lt;ref name="Paul College Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul College of Business and Economics|url=http://www.unh.edu/facilities/fpm_paul.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130410000116/http://www.unh.edu/facilities/fpm_paul.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-10|publisher=University of New Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly the Whittemore School of Business and Economics (WSBE), the Paul School offers degrees&lt;ref name="PTP Major Listings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Course Catalog|url=http://www.unh.edu/undergrad-catalog/degrees.cfm?id=6&amp;page=degree|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Business Administration (featuring focuses in Accounting, Entrepreneurial Venture Creation, Finance, Information Systems Management, International Business and Economics, Management, and Marketing), Hospitality, and Economics (either in B.A. or B.S.&lt;ref name="PTP Major Listings"/&gt;)

As of the 2015 fall semester, the university had 12,840 [[undergraduate]] students and 2,500 [[Graduate school|graduate]] students enrolled in more than 200 [[Academic major|majors]].

The Graduate Student Senate (GSS) represents all graduate students at UNH,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unh.edu/gss|title=Graduate Student Senate|date=June 11, 2013|work=University of New Hampshire|access-date=October 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with senators elected from all colleges (College of Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences, College of Liberal Arts, College of Life Sciences &amp; Agriculture, College of Health &amp; Human Sciences, Paul College of Business &amp; Economics) as well as from the Graduate School and graduate housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unh.edu/gss/executive-committee-senators|title=Executive Committee &amp; Senators|date=June 12, 2013|work=University of New Hampshire|access-date=October 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive committee, composed of 6-7 members, includes a President, Vice President, Communications Officer, Financial Affairs Officer, External Affairs Officer, and Community Coordinator, with the most recent Past President serving at the discretion of the current President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unh.edu/gss/structure-representation|title=Structure &amp; Representation|date=June 12, 2013|work=University of New Hampshire|access-date=October 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senators and executive committee members serve on both internal and external committees, maintaining ties with other student organizations, as well as with the faculty and administration, in order to gather information and act on behalf of graduate student interests. GSS representation, elections, and other functions are governed by the UNH Graduate Student Senate Constitution &amp; Bylaws.

The Student Senate of the University of New Hampshire is the on-campus, undergraduate student government. The Student Senate controls the use of the Student Activity Fee, and directly governs student organizations that receive a regular, annual budget from it. The Student Senate also formulates student stances on University policy, and attempts to lobby its position to administrators and the local and state government.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/sites/default/files/departments/student_senate/student_senate_constitution_april_2014.pdf|title=Student Senate Constitution|date=October 31, 2017|work=University of New Hampshire Student Senate|access-date=November 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its Constitution, the Student Senate "[serves] as an advocate for all undergraduate students, deriving its power from the [[consent of the governed]] and developed on the principle that all undergraduate students of the University of New Hampshire have the right to participate in University governance. Such participation encourages the development of student expertise in University affairs and places significant responsibility on students for their involvement with the policies, rules, and regulations which affect the quality of education and the experience of students at the University of New
Hampshire."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Underrepresented students==
===Diversity Support Coalition===

The student led Diversity Support Coalition (DSC) mission aims to offer resources to groups “affected by institutionalized oppression based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and expression, age, ability, native language, national origin, and/or religion at UNH”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity Support Coalition|url=https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|website=WildcatLink|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427044531/https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|archive-date=April 27, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSC promotes, educates, and supports multiculturalism, diversity, and equality at UNH through programming efforts and support of the six student organizations within the DSC. The six member groups are Alliance, The Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, The Native American Cultural Association, and The United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition and may due so by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.

In addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.

=== Women ===

Multiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural clubs ===

Culturally focused groups on campus include Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association. These groups often host events to educate the student body on their cultures and to welcome experts of ancestral crafts. Conversely, the Committee on Rights and Justice (CORAJ) partners UNH student's with local immigrant families, helping them with the naturalization process.

=== International students ===

The University instituted the [[Navitas Group|Navitas program]] in 2011 to expand the amount of international students at the school. This expanded over the years into the Global Student Success Program (GSSP). The GSSP, in cooperation with the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), gives students the support to “help discover opportunities at UNH to immerse in American culture and share your own traditions with others from the U.S. and from around the globe”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/global/international-students&lt;/ref&gt; The programs guide students through the application process and the extent of their career.

During Fall 2015, UNH enrolled 298 Students from 34 different countries. The most common countries of origin are the People's Republic of China, Canada, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Profile|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|website=University of New Hampshire Office of Admissions|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024821/http://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|archive-date=August 10, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also offers intensive English language education for students through the ESL Institute. As well as advancing student’s knowledge of English as a second-language one of the goals of the ESL Institute is to “to provide students with the cultural knowledge and awareness needed to function satisfactorily, both academically and socially, in the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;https://cola.unh.edu/esl-institute/mission-statement&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2015 year the university had almost 300 students representing the school from over 30 countries.

===First-generation college students===
Begun in 1994, UNH Connect is a program where FGCS (and multicultural students) are given a jump-start to the experiences of college life with a summer pre-orientation program aimed at social connection and comfortability with college life. Each student is assigned a peer mentor who helps with the transition to their freshman year. The program, with 100 students in 2014, also gives FGCS an opportunity to meet people in similar situations prior to the beginning of college.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/orientation/connect/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center For Academic Resources (CFAR) also offers a program called TRIO that is partially funded by the US Department of Education. TRIO is intended for students who are FGCS, have a disability, or are in extreme financial need. Through the TRIO program you can receive services to help understand options for future careers as well as advice with financial aspects of college most FGCS would not have home support with. These include academic tutoring, assistance with student loans, scholarship advise, individual counseling, career planning, and many more. In the 2017-18 school year the UNH TRIO program was funded for 200 students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/cfar/triostudent-support-services&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The University of New Hampshire offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in music and the Bachelor of Music; and two graduate degree programs: the Master of Arts in music (concentrations in composition, conducting, and musicology), and the Master of Arts in teaching.

==Athletics==
{{main|New Hampshire Wildcats}}
[[File:Whittemore Center, UNH 2.jpg|thumb|Whittemore Center]]
The school's athletic teams are the [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|Wildcats]], and they compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. New Hampshire is a member of the [[America East Conference]] for [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[tennis]]; and women's [[lacrosse]], [[crew]], [[field hockey]], and [[volleyball]]. The women's gymnastics&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhwildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wgym women's gymnastics]&lt;/ref&gt; program competes in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League at the Division I level. They also compete in [[Hockey East]] in men's and women's [[ice hockey]], Eastern Collegiate Ski Association for skiing, as well as the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] for [[American football|football]] at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as [[Division I-AA]]) level.

In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming &amp; diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12. Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships. The reason given was that the athletic department would save $500,000 towards a $1 million budget shortfall and be in compliance with [[Title IX]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141044/http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml|date=February 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the university cut baseball, softball, men's and women's golf, and men's lacrosse.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through the Department of Campus Recreation, including [[aikido]], [[archery]], [[baseball]], [[crew]], [[cycling]], [[dance]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[figure skating]], [[golf]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[sailing]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[taekwondo]], men and women's Ultimate Frisbee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate| last1=Johnson| first1=Cameron| title=Ultimate Frisbee: Sisters of Oriza: A look inside women's Ultimate| work=[[The New Hampshire]]| date=November 7, 2014| accessdate=November 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012085115/https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate/| archive-date=October 12, 2015| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and the Woodsmen Club. Many of these clubs compete either on an intercollegiate basis with New England teams, or sponsor university tournaments and frequently participate in national championships. UNH also offers horseback riding as a recreation. Many students can take horseback riding lessons with instructors, on their horse or the schools. UNH holds many events each year, for they have a large cross country course. UNH also has a [[dressage]] team and a hunt seat team that competes yearly.

The school's official colors are [[blue]] and [[white]]. The school's official mascot is the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] and its uniformed mascot is known as "[[Wild E. Cat]]".

The recognized [[fight song]] of UNH is "[[On to Victory (song)|On to Victory]]", the most current version of which was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998–2003. In 2003, "UNH Cheer" (originally titled "Cheer Boys") was resurrected from the university archives by Erika Svanoe, Director of Athletic Bands from 2003-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.erikasvanoe.com/conducting.html| title=Professional Experience| publisher=ErikaSvanoe.com| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the school song "Old New Hampshire", not to be confused with the [[Old New Hampshire|New Hampshire state song]] of the same name, "UNH Cheer" currently serves as a secondary fight song and is often performed immediately following "On to Victory".

On October 7, 2006, Wildcats [[wide receiver]] [[David Ball (wide receiver)|David Ball]] tallied the 51st receiving [[touchdown]] of his career to displace [[Jerry Rice]] of [[Mississippi Valley State University]], who was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] a month earlier, atop the ranking of NCAA Division I and I-AA players by career receiving touchdowns. He later signed as a [[rookie]] [[free agent]] with the [[Chicago Bears]] and played with well-known college football players [[Chris Leak]] and [[Darius Walker]].

==Durham campus==
[[File:CongreveAcrossTHall.JPG|thumb|left|Congreve Hall]]The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], and is a "traditional New England campus." The Durham campus is {{convert|1100|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the "campus core" and {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land.

===Housing===
[[File:Smith Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Hall c. 1915]]
[[File:Mills Hall.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text|Mills Hall - suites]]
[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]
The university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.

The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.

Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.

For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A &amp; B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.

Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.

Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themed housing===
The University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality. Common themes include: first year, leadership, green living, multi-cultural, honors, chem-free, alcohol and drug-free and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.residential-life.unh.edu/living/hallsandthemes.html |title=Living on Campus – Theme Living Communities |publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing is guaranteed to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and [[Williamson Hall]], the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alexander Hall| url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/alexander-hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) lose this guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester in order to be considered for on-campus housing the following semester.&lt;ref name=wait-list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |title=UNH Housing Waitlist Process |publisher=Unh.edu |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701173600/http://unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfer students can generally get on campus housing if transferring to UNH for the spring semester (but must submit a completed housing wait-list application prior to transferring);&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt; however, transfer students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/transfer|title=Transfer Students|date=2016-02-03|work=Undergraduate Admissions|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring for the fall semester have a relatively low chance of getting on campus housing due to the high demand of returning students, and the incoming freshman class. Transfer students are also not guaranteed housing, unless transferring from a community college after graduating with their associates.&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt;

==Manchester campus==
[[File:Manch-mills-westside.jpg|thumb|right|The north end of the Amoskeag Millyard, on the [[Merrimack River]]]]
[[File:Manch-DownTown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]], looking south along Elm Street]]
As of March 2015, [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] is located in the {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} Pandora Mill at 88 Commercial Street, on the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] in Manchester's historic [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Millyard]]. The move to 88 Commercial Street increased the physical plant of the college by almost 50%, as from 2001 to 2014 the school was located in the {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} University Center building at 400 Commercial Street.

==National Historic Chemical Landmark==
Conant Hall was dedicated as a [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|National Historical Chemical Landmark]]—the first in New Hampshire. Conant Hall was the first chemistry building on the Durham campus, and it was the headquarters of the [[American Chemical Society]] from 1907–1911, when Charles Parsons was the society’s secretary. In addition, from 1906–1928, the hall housed the laboratories of Charles James, who was an innovative developer of separation and analytical methods for compounds of rare earth elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=925&amp;content_id=CTP_004295&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=7645e5b7-59c9-4b73-afa0-fd8a2804bfeb  ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark], Separation of Rare Earth Elements (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; James Hall, the second chemistry building on campus, was named for Charles James.

The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)''' is a [[CEO]]-led organization of over 200 [[multinational company|international companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us|title=About us|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional buisness councils and partner organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/world-business-council-sustainable-development-wbcsd-0|title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development - WBCSD {{!}} Genève Internationale|website=www.geneve-int.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include:

* Rodney F. Chase - [[BP]] (1995)

==Geographic balance==
Most of WBCSD's member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' (F&amp;ES) is a [[professional school]] of [[Yale University]]. It was founded to train [[forester]]s, and now trains environmental leaders through four 2-year degree programs ([[Master of Environmental Management]], Master of [[Environmental Science]], Master of [[Forestry]], and Master of Forest Science) and two 10-month mid-career programs. Yale F&amp;ES strives to create new knowledge that will sustain and restore the health of the biosphere and emphasizes the possibility of creating a regenerative coexistence between humans and non-human life and the rest of the natural world. Still offering forestry instruction, the school has the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.

==History==
[[File:Yale School of Forestry class of 1904.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Yale School of Forestry class of 1904]]
The school was founded in 1900 as the '''Yale Forest School''', to provide high-level forestry training suited to American conditions. At the urging of Yale alumnus [[Gifford Pinchot]], his parents endowed the two-year postgraduate program. At the time Pinchot was serving as [[Bernhard Fernow]]'s successor as Chief of the Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], USFS). Pinchot released two foresters from the division to start the school: fellow Yale graduate [[Henry Solon Graves]] and James Toumey.&lt;ref name=Sparhawk&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparhawk |first=W.N. |chapter=The History of Forestry in America |page=710 |title=Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture |year=1949 |location=Washington, D.C.  |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |url= https://archive.org/stream/treesyearbookofa00unitrich |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves became the School's first dean and Toumey its second.

When the school opened, other places in the United States offered forestry training, but none had a post-graduate program. (Both Pinchot and Graves had gone to Europe to study forestry after graduating from Yale.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinchot |first=Gifford |title=Breaking New Ground |year=1998 |publisher=Island Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n64aE9kblKMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA152 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1900, the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] had 24 students, [[Biltmore Forest School]] 9, and Yale 7.&lt;ref name="Sparhawk" /&gt; Despite its small size, from its beginnings the school influenced American forestry. The first two chiefs of the USFS were Pinchot and Graves; the next three were graduates from the school's first decade. Wilderness and land conservation advocate [[Aldo Leopold]] graduated in the class of 1908.

In 1915, Yale School of Forestry's second dean, James Toumey, became one of the "charter members", along with [[William L. Bray]] of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]], by then reestablished at [[Syracuse University]], and [[Raphael Zon]], of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/|title=You are being redirected...|author=|date=|website=esa.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the "activist wing" of that society formed [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"/&gt;

Besides the school's own forests, Yale has used a number of other sites in the eastern United States for field education over the years. From 1904 to 1926, the summer session leading to a master's degree in forestry was held at [[Grey Towers National Historic Site|Grey Towers]] and [[Forester's Hall]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050979_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Forester's Hall |accessdate=2012-05-30 |last1=Steiner |first1=Ben |last2=Husson |first2=Leon |last3=Helfrich |first3=Carson O. |format = PDF |date= December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1912, Yale classes took occasional field trips to the land of the Crossett Lumber Company in [[Arkansas]]. For two decades from 1946 until 1966, the company provided the school a "camp," including cabins and a mess hall, used during spring coursework on forest management and wood products production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1-last=Darling, Jr. |author1-first=O.

Reflective of the expanding variety of environmental interests, the school changed its name to the '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' in 1972. Today, F&amp;ES is a leader in global sustainability, hosting the bi-annual [http://yess.yale.edu Yale Environmental Sustainability Summit] to assemble thought leaders from around the globe. The school's 16th and present dean is [https://environment.yale.edu/profile/burke/ Ingrid "Indy" Burke], who replaced [[Peter Crane|Sir Peter Crane]] in October, 2016.&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;{{Citation | url   = http://news.yale.edu/2016/07/20/biogeochemist-indy-burke-named-dean-yale-s-school-forestry-environmental-studies | title = Biogeochemist Indy Burke named dean of Yale’s School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies | work  = YaleNews | publisher  = [[Yale University]] | accessdate = March 8, 2017 | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sage Hall Sunset.JPG|thumb|Sage Hall, completed in 1924]]
[[File:Yale From the Sky Science Hill.jpg|thumb|The School of Forestry's main buildings, bottom center, on [[Science Hill (Yale University)|Science Hill]]]]
The school offers classes at Kroon Hall, Sage Hall, Greeley Labs, [[Othniel C. Marsh House|Marsh Hall]], the Environmental Science Center, the houses at 301 Prospect St. and 380 Edwards St., and teaches the Yale College undergraduate courses needed for the Environmental Studies major. Kroon Hall, the school's main building, is named for the philanthropist Richard Kroon (Yale Class of 1964). The building has {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-3}} of space. It is "a showcase of the latest developments in green building technology, a healthy and supportive environment for work and study, and a beautiful building that actively connects students, faculty, staff, and visitors with the natural world."&lt;ref name="Kroon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.yale.edu/kroon/ |title=Kroon Hall |publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building obtained Platinum Rating under the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification system.&lt;ref name="Kroon" /&gt; It is designed by [[Hopkins Architects]] of London with Architect of Record Centerbrook Architects.  Goodfellow Inc from Delson, Quebec, supplied the [[glulam]] roof structure for this project.

The [[Yale-Myers Forest]], in [[Union, Connecticut]], donated to Yale in 1930 by alumnus [[George Hewitt Myers]], is managed by the school as a multiple-use working forest. Yale-Toumey Forest, near [[Keene, New Hampshire]], was set up by James W. Toumey (a former dean of the school) in 1913. Other Yale forestlands include Goss Woods, Crowell Forest, Cross Woods, [[Bowen Forest]], and Crowell Ravine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.yale.edu/forests/ |title=Yale School Forests |publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-alarm fire burned several buildings within the Yale Myers Forest Camp on May 28th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/05/29/fire-claims-four-fes-buildings/|title=Fire claims four F&amp;ES buildings|author=|date=|website=yaledailynews.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebuilding efforts are ongoing.

== Student life ==
The school has an active tradition of student involvement in academic and extracurricular life. Many students take part in student interest groups, which organize events around environmental issues of interest to them. These groups range in interest from Conservation Finance and International Development, to the Built Environment and "Fresh &amp; Salty: The Society for Marine and Coastal systems". There are also social and recreational groups, such as the Forestry Club, which every Friday organizes themed "TGIF" ("Thank-God-I'm-a-Forester") happy hours and school parties; the Polar Bear club, which swims monthly in Long Island Sound under the full moon (year-round); Veggie Dinner, which is a weekly vegetarian dinner club; the Loggerrhythms, an a cappella singing group; and the student-run BYO Café in Kroon Hall opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Drew |title=Kroon opens student café |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/feb/18/kroon-opens-student-cafe/ |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable F&amp;ES tradition is the extravagant environmentally inspired decoration of graduation caps in preparation for commencement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/graduation-snapshots/|title=Graduation snapshots|author=|date=|website=environment.yale.edu|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
