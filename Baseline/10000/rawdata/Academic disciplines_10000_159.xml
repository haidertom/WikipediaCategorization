'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

An '''Armenian cross''' is a symbol that combines a [[cross]] with a floral postament or elements. In the [[Armenian Christianity]] it was combined with the [[Christian cross]] and this design was often used for [[high cross]]es ([[khachkar]]) – a free-standing cross made of stone and often richly decorated.

== Education ==
Kucinski graduated in Physics at the University of São Paulo (USP) between 1967 and 1968. He returned in 1986 and joined the staff of the USP School of Communications and Arts. In 1991, he earned a Ph.D. in Communication Sciences from the University of São Paulo, with a thesis on alternative media in Brazil during the period, 1964-1980.

== Career ==

=== Journalist and publisher ===
Bernardo Kucinski is one of the most experienced and respected journalists in the current Brazilian scene.{{according to whom|date=April 2016}} Although he graduated in Physics, he entered journalism with the encouragement of [[Raimundo Pereira]], a friend. By force of circumstances (in this case, the military regime that governed the country), he moved to England. In London, between 1971 and 1974, Kucinski was producer and host of the BBC, and a correspondent of journal ''Opinião'' first and after ''Gazeta Mercantil'', dedicated to deepen their training in economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portaldosjornalistas.com.br/perfil.aspx?id=14059 Profile at Portal dos Jornalistas]&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Brazil in 1974, Kucinski participated in the founding of alternative newspapers including ''Em Movimento'' and ''Tempo'' (which was the first publisher in 1977). Thereafter, he worked as editor of ''Gazeta Mercantil'' and was a correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Euromoney]]'', and ''Latin America Political Report''. He also contributed to the science magazine, ''[[Ciência Hoje]]''.

=== Academic ===
In 1986 he joined the staff of the University of São Paulo as a professor in the School of Communications and Arts. In 1991, he presented his doctoral thesis, ''Revolutionary Journalists''.

=== Political advisor ===
In 2002, with the victory of the candidate of the Workers Party, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Kucinski becomes a special advisor to the Ministry of Social Communication of the Presidency. He left this employment in 2006.

== Awards ==
* Kucinski was awarded the [[Jabuti Prize]] for Literature in 1997 in Economics, Management, Business and Law, for his book ''Economic Journalism'' (1996), a result of his thesis for faculty and postdoctoral held in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Bike Arc LLC''', located in downtown [[Palo Alto, California]], is a Silicon Valley startup that designs secure [[bicycle parking rack]]s and systems. It was founded by Joseph Bellomo and Jeff Selzer in 2008. Jeff Selzer sits on the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://bikesiliconvalley.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the General Manager of Palo Alto Bicycles. Joseph Bellomo, a [[California]]-licensed [[architect]], is the founder and owner of [[Joseph Bellomo Architects]], Inc. in Palo Alto, which he founded in 1986. In addition to collaborating on Bike Arc, Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer also worked together on the Palo Alto Bikestation at the [[Caltrain]] depot.

[[File:Umbrella Arc by Bike Arc in downtown Palo Alto, California..jpg|thumb|Umbrella Arc bicycle parking system/bike racks/bicycle storage by Bike Arc.]]

In 2009, the American Institute of Architects, California Council, gave Bike Arc the Honor Award for Small Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Honor Award for Small Projects|url=http://www.aiacc.org/2011/08/02/bike-arc/|publisher=AIACC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer—both being bicycle enthusiasts—set out to design bicycle-parking systems that don't touch and potentially damage bicycles, a solution that prevents bicycles from contacting each other, which can cause wear-and-tear.

== Products ==

Bike Arc is [[patented]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD604207}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the United States and in Europe (Office for Harmonization In the Internal Market), and the company offers multiple iterations of the same fundamental concept: a [[modular]] [[structure]] of [[steel]] arcs. The Bike Arc family includes the Rack Arc, the Half Arc, the Umbrella Arc, the Tube Arc, the Car Arc, the Bus Arc, the House Arc, and the Ad Arc.

All Bike Arc products are manufactured in the United States.

== Installations ==

The City of Palo Alto has purchased and installed multiple Bike Arc products, including numerous Rack Arcs, Half Arcs and Umbrella Arcs, and Bike Arcs are also in public spaces in Boston, Las Vegas, Redwood City, California, and Norfolk, Virginia. They have also been installed at the University of Buffalo and the University of Nebraska, as well as—among others—at Juniper Networks, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., and the Seattle Repertory Theater.

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev.

On 3 December 2015, CJCUC spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/55561/groundbreaking-petition-signed-leading-rabbis-calls-increased-partnership-between-jews-christians-biblical-zionism/|title=Groundbreaking Petition Signed by Leading Rabbis Calls for Increased Partnership Between Jews and Christians|first= Adam Eliyahu|last=Berkowitz|publisher=Breaking Israel News|date=7 December 2015|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/modern-orthodox-leaders-bless-interfaith-dialogue|title=Modern Orthodox Leaders Bless Interfaith Dialogue|first=Steve|last=Lipman|publisher=[[The Jewish Week]]|date=8 December 2015|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2015/12/11/Vatican-Orthodox-rabbis-issue-interfaith-statements-affirming-each-other-s-faith/stories/201512110164|title=Vatican, Orthodox rabbis issue interfaith statements affirming each other's faith|first=Peter|last=Smith|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=11 December 2015|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-shmuly-yanklowitz/towards-jewish-christian-reconciliation_b_9133926.html|title=Towards Jewish-Christian Reconciliation &amp; Partnership|first=Rabbi Shmuly|last=Yanklowitz|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Intellectual-Judaism/Mutual-Judeo-Christian-spiritual-foundation-of-Judaism-and-Christianity-444183|title=Mutual Judeo-Christian spiritual foundation of Judaism and Christianity|first=VLADIMIR|last=MINKOV|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=7 February 2016|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vaticanradio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/12/10/orthodox_rabbis_issue_groundbreaking_statement_on_christians/1193458|title=Orthodox Rabbis issue groundbreaking statement on Christianity|publisher=[[Vatican Radio]]|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented statement, entitled ''"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians"'', was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States, and Europe,&lt;ref name="vaticanradio" /&gt; and now has over 60 signatories.&lt;ref name="orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjcuc.com/site/2015/12/03/orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity/|title=Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity – To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven – Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians|website=CJCUC|date=3 December 2015|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|The real importance of this Orthodox statement is that it calls for fraternal partnership between Jewish and Christian religious leaders, while also acknowledging the positive theological status of the Christian faith.

In May 2017, the statement was approbated by Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]] of [[Argentina]] and Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] [[Archbishop of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity" /&gt;

'''''Colleges That Change Lives'''''  is a [[undergraduate education|college]] educational guide, originally by longtime student advocate and former ''[[New York Times]]'' education editor [[Loren Pope]].&lt;ref name="Wash Post obit" /&gt; It was first published in 1996, with a second edition in 2000, a third edition in 2006 and a fourth edition in 2013. It concerns [[college admissions in the United States]].

The third edition profiles 40 choices for [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that, according to Pope, offer as much, if not more, than [[Ivy League]] schools: "The phrase 'Ivy League education' is an [[wikt:oxymoron|oxymoron]] when compared to the benefactions to mind and soul the colleges in this book bestow.  Not only are they better, but they want you, and you will love them for making a new and better you. Your satisfaction will be lifelong."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Loren. ''Colleges That Change Lives'', 3rd edition, 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colleges That Change Lives, Inc.==
Following Loren Pope's message, '''Colleges That Change Lives, Inc.''' (CTCL) was founded in 2006 as a non-profit, [[501(c)(3)]] organization dedicated to the advancement and support of a student-centered college search process. The organization supports the goal of each student finding a college that develops a lifelong love of learning and provides the foundation for a successful and fulfilling life beyond college. According to the CTCL website: 
{{quote|In following Mr. Pope’s ideals, we believe that the criteria most college-bound students and their parents and counselors use, such as name and prestige, do not acknowledge the importance of understanding an individual student’s needs and how they 'fit' with the mission and identity of an individual college community.}} 
The organization's work is inspired by Loren Pope, who died in 2008.&lt;ref name="Wash Post obit"&gt;Hutchinson, Carol. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092603547.html "College Consultant Loren Pope; Commissioned a Wright House"], ''The Washington Post'', 27 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Colleges That Change Lives, Inc. operates independently from both the Pope estate and Penguin Books and receives no financial remuneration from either source.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

CTCL hosts programs during four annual tours in 26 cities in the United States and abroad. Each programs offers a 30-minute presentation about how to choose a college for fit, not rank, and then provides attendees the opportunity to speak with representatives from the 40 colleges featured in the book. The programs are free of charge and open to the public.  In addition, [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], [[Bard College]], and [[Grinnell College]] were formerly institutions rated by Loren Pope as Colleges That Change Lives, but were removed in later editions because the institutions became too selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/28/education/28face.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=teachersandschoolemployees|title = A Fighter for Colleges That Have Everything but Status|last = Finder|first = Alan|date = February 28, 2007|work = |access-date = May 10, 2015|via = |newspaper = The New York Times|department = Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Andrews University (North Carolina)|St. Andrews University]] (formerly St. Andrews Presbyterian College) was included in the revised edition, but removed in later editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">[[Sociology of religion|Sociologists of religion]] have stated that [[religious behaviour]] may have a concrete impact on a person's life. These '''consequences of religiosity''' are thought to include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness.{{sfn|Cornwall|Albrecht|Cunningham|Pitcher|1986}}

==Glock's religiosity measure==
This term ''consequences'' as the result of one's [[religiosity]] first appeared in [[Charles Y. Glock]]'s five-dimensional religiosity measure. In the 1960s, Glock attempted to categorize the components of religiosity. In his five-dimensional scheme "consequences" are listed as the final dimension of religiosity. Glock theorized that certain consequences in a person's life can be attributed to religious living. Consequences of religiosity may include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of these factors working in the reverse as health, happiness and the like may interact with and have an influence on one's level of religiosity.{{sfnm |1a1=Cornwall |1a2=Albrecht |1a3=Cunningham |1a4=Pitcher |1y=1986 |2a1=Glock |2y=1972}}

==Criticism of the term==
Glock's consequential dimension of religiosity was criticized by some sociologists as they saw Glock's final dimension as ''consequence of'' religiosity and not a ''dimension of'' it.{{sfnm |1a1=Fichter |1y=1969 |2a1=Payne |2a2=Elifson |2y=1976}}

'''''Dark Eden''''' is a [[social science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[British people|British]] author [[Chris Beckett]], first published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012. The novel explores the disintegration of a small group of a highly [[Inbreeding|inbred]] people, descendants of two individuals whose spaceship crashed on a [[rogue planet]] they call Eden.

The book won the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] for best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins about 160 years after two human beings, Angela and Tommy, were stranded on Eden. Their three companions—Mehmet, Michael, and Dixon—left in a damaged spaceship to get help. Years passed, and although Angela and Tommy held out hope for rescue, they began to raise children and form a new society which they named "Family". Frequent and regular [[incest]] among their descendants became common, with few children knowing who their father was. Social life centers around powerful rituals: Retelling of story of the stranding, the worship of what few relics remain, myths about Earth, and the need to stay close to Circle—the place where the landing vehicle is supposed to return to, and bring them back to Earth. Social norms are strongly adhered to in this [[matriarchy]], and innovation is rare.

Family's world, Eden, is so far from its sun that it is icebound. Only a small area, which the Family calls Circle Valley, is temperate. Eden's animals each have two hearts, green-black blood, huge and lidless eyes, six legs, and tentacled feelers around their mouths. The animal population, however, is not diverse. Trees tap into the heat just below Eden's surface, bringing up warmth and providing fruit and other food. Nearly all plant and animal life on Eden is [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], allowing the humans to see, while overhead the [[Milky Way]] can be easily seen at all times.

The novel centers around John Redlantern, a "newhair" (teenager) who hates the deep social and technological conservatism of Family. Killing a deadly leopard proves to be an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] which opens his eyes to the [[Malthusian catastrophe]] facing Family, which has grown too large for its tiny valley. Supported by pretty Tina Spikestree and John's cousins (the somewhat passive teenaged Gerry and the [[club foot]]ed pre-adolescent, thoughtful Jeff), John engages in a series of [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] acts which lead to the "breaking" of Family. Exile of John and his teenaged followers is only the first of many ramifications, as John leads a [[Messianism|messianic]] quest for a land "over Cold Dark" where Family can grow and thrive.

==Themes==
The novel is told in the [[Narration#First-person|first-person]] voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a different character's perspective.&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chris-beckett/dark-eden-beckett/|title=Kirkus Review: ''Dark Eden'' by Chris Beckett|website=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drift (linguistics)|Linguistic drift]] has given the people of Eden unique nouns ("police veekle", "rayed yoh", and "Jesus Juice" instead of "police vehicle", "radio", and "Jesus and the Jews").&lt;ref name=kirkus /&gt; The [[adverb]] "very" has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by [[reduplication]] ("bad bad" instead of "very bad").&lt;ref name=yahoointer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/brooklyn-baby-talk-dialect-dark-eden-exclusive-author-200811773.html|last=Beckett|first=Chris|title=Brooklyn, Baby Talk, and the Dialect of 'Dark Eden': Exclusive From Author Chris Beckett|website=Yahoo News|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistic relativity]] has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world ("Cold Dark" instead of "high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers").&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/chris-beckett/|last=Goldschlager|first=Amy|title=Interview: Chris Beckett, Author of ''Dark Eden''|website=Kirkus Reviews|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted a society in which "the Eden settlers were a bunch of kids and two adults... .  There's no external adult world as a reference point".&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.&lt;ref name=yahoointer /&gt;

Beckett intended the novel to be "the [[Book of Genesis|Bible story]]...turned on its head",&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; one in which people are "expelled to [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]".&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; He conceived the novel after realizing that much of the [[Old Testament]] consisted of "small domestic stories elevated to a mythical level", and he established the social norms, rituals, and myths of Family around similar stories.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

Beckett also wanted to explore themes about making hard choices. To [[Thinking outside the box|think outside the box]] sometimes requires not only "transgressive" but extremely "cruel" behavior, he told ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a [[reactionary]] response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of [[patriarchy]]) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of the latter part of the novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

==Critical reception and awards==
''Dark Eden'' was author Chris Beckett's second novel.&lt;ref name=clarkeaward /&gt;  Reviews were generally very positive in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; Stuart Kelly in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it a "superior piece of theologically nuanced science fiction", although he noted that the novel drew a little heavily on [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]'' and [[Will Self]]'s ''[[The Book of Dave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/science-fiction-fiction|last=Kelly|first=Stuart|title=Dark Eden by Chris Beckett - review|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Paul Di Filippo]], reviewing the book for ''Locus'' magazine, described the plot as uninventive but "so splendidly [written] it feels brand new and remade".&lt;ref name=fillipp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2013/07/paul-di-filippo-reviews-chris-beckett/|last=Di Filippo|first=Paul|title=Paul Di Filippo Reviews Chris Beckett|work=Locus|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that the novel's "harsh oasis" plot device resembled the work of [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Larry Niven]], and [[Karl Schroeder]]. But that didn't matter: "[A]ll this heavy categorizing misses the essence of the reader’s first contact with the book, which is pure astonishment and pleasure, a storytelling ride full of brio and wonder. ... The reader is swiftly seduced by two things that are intrinsic to, but separate from, the powerful plot: the Carrollian language, and the freaky ecology."&lt;ref name=fillipp /&gt; He had high praise for the character of John Redlantern, who was a [[metaphor]] (in De Filippo's mind) for both [[Moses]] and [[Cain]].&lt;ref name=fillipp /&gt; Harry Ritchie in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said "Human plight and alien planet are both superbly evoked in [this] captivating and haunting book"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2092242/SCIENCE-FICTION.html#ixzz3XUWNyECV|last=Ritchie|first=Harry|title=Science Fiction|work=Daily Mail|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while David Langford in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said ''Dark Eden'' contained "A classic theme, beautifully told".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9012739/Sci-Fi-roundup-January-15.html|last=Langford|first=David|title=Sci-Fi roundup: January 15|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Eden'' was published in the United States in April 2014 by [[Broadway Books]]. American reviewers were much more critical of the book. In ''Kirkus Reviews'', an anonymous reviewer called it "[a]bsorbing if often familiar, inventive and linguistically adept but less than fully satisfying... Enjoyable but no blockbuster."&lt;ref name=kirkus /&gt; Author [[N. K. Jemisin]], reviewing the novel in ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised Beckett's method of rendering "the terror of the darkness beyond the forests with a riveting deftness" and the way he "cleverly" introduced new challenges and threats to keep the reader interested.&lt;ref name=jemisin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/jeff-vandermeers-authority-and-more.html|last=Jemisin|first=N.K.|title=Science Fiction: Jeff VanderMeer's 'Authority,' and More|work=The New York Times|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she strongly criticized the plot for being predictable and hackneyed and the characters for being clichéd. She had harsh words for what she saw as "the 1950s ethos underpinning the whole thing. The Family has developed into a relatively peaceful communal society that venerates its elders and has necessarily relaxed sexual norms; the society John seeks to create instead is monogamous, individualistic, rife with subtle bigotries and rooted in murder. Survival and progress, the story seems to suggest, require these things."&lt;ref name=jemisin /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' thought the novel "hew[ed] too closely to historical patterns", and declared the climax very unsatisfying. The reviewer still found the changing narrative viewpoints, ecological setting, and linguistic devices interesting, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8041-3868-0|title=Dark Eden; Chris Beckett, Author|website=Publishers Weekly|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
''Dark Eden'' won the 2013 Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012.&lt;ref name=clarkeaward&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/chris-beckett-wins-arthur-c-clarke-award|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Chris Beckett wins Arthur C Clarke award for Dark Eden|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke Award judge Andrew M. Butler, noting why the judges gave the award to a new author rather than an established writer, said of the book, "''Dark Eden'' fuses rich biological and sociological speculation. Beckett really makes you care for characters who are stranded light years from an Earth they have never really known."&lt;ref name=clarkeaward /&gt;

'''Development economics''' is a branch of [[economics]] which deals with economic aspects of the development process in low income countries. Its focus is not only on methods of promoting [[economic development]], [[economic growth]] and [[structural change]] but also on improving the potential for the mass of the population, for example, through health, education and workplace conditions, whether through public or private channels.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, pp. 818, 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development economics involves the creation of theories and methods that aid in the determination of policies and practices and can be implemented at either the domestic or international level.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1981). "Economic Development: A Semantic History," ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 29(3), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1153704 pp. 457]–66. Chicago: The Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may involve restructuring market incentives or using mathematical methods such as intertemporal [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] for project analysis, or it may involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in many other fields of economics, approaches in development economics may incorporate social and political factors to devise particular plans.&lt;ref name="Economic Development"&gt;Todaro, Michael and Stephen Smith.

==Theories of development economics==

=== Mercantilism and physiocracy ===
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|thumb|World GDP per capita, from 1400 to 2003&amp;nbsp;CE]]{{Main article|Mercantilism}}
The earliest Western theory of development economics was [[mercantilism]], which developed in the 17th century, paralleling the rise of the [[nation state]]. Earlier theories had given little attention to development. For example, [[scholasticism]], the dominant school of thought during medieval feudalism, emphasized reconciliation with Christian theology and ethics, rather than development. The 16th- and 17th-century [[School of Salamanca]], credited as the earliest modern school of economics, likewise did not address development specifically.

Major European nations in the 17th and 18th century all adopted mercantilist ideals to varying degrees, the influence only ebbing with the 18th-century development of [[physiocrats]] in France and [[classical economics]] in Britain. Mercantilism held that a nation's prosperity depended on its supply of capital, represented by bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state. It emphasised the maintenance of a high positive trade balance (maximising exports and minimising imports) as a means of accumulating this bullion. To achieve a positive trade balance, protectionist measures such as tariffs and subsidies to home industries were advocated. Mercantilist development theory also advocated [[colonialism]].

Theorists most associated with mercantilism include [[Philipp von Hörnigk]], who in his ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'' of 1684 gave the only comprehensive statement of mercantilist theory, emphasizing production and an export-led economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, mercantilist policy is most associated with 17th-century finance minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], whose policies proved influential in later American development.

Mercantilist ideas continue in the theories of [[economic nationalism]] and [[neomercantilism]].

=== Economic nationalism ===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], credited as Father of the National System]]
{{Main article|Economic nationalism}}
Following mercantilism was the related theory of [[economic nationalism]], promulgated in the 19th century related to the development and industrialization of the United States and Germany, notably in the policies of the [[American School (economics)|American System]] in America and the [[Zollverein]] (customs union) in Germany. A significant difference from mercantilism was the de-emphasis on colonies, in favor of a focus on domestic production.

The names most associated with 19th-century economic nationalism are the American [[Alexander Hamilton]], the German-American [[Friedrich List]], and the American [[Henry Clay]]. Hamilton's 1791 ''[[Report on Manufactures]],'' his magnum opus, is the founding text of the American System, and drew from the mercantilist economies of Britain under Elizabeth I and France under Colbert. List's 1841 ''Das Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie'' (translated into English as The National System of Political Economy), which emphasized stages of growth, proved influential in the US and Germany, and nationalist policies were pursued by politician Henry Clay, and later by [[Abraham Lincoln]], under the influence of economist [[Henry Charles Carey]].

Forms of economic nationalism and neomercantilism have also been key in Japan's development in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the more recent development of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore), and, most significantly, China.

Following [[Brexit]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], some experts have argued a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" popularly known as [[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]] could have a considerable impact on cross-border investment flows and long-term capital allocation&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman: [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

=== Post-WWII theories ===
{{See also|Industrial development|Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory}}

The origins of modern development economics are often traced to the need for, and likely problems with the industrialization of eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, G.M. and Seers, D. (Eds) (1984). ''Pioneers in Development''. New York: Oxford University Press for the World Bank. [http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/19/3/503 Review extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; The key authors are [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein-Rodan, P.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ragnar Nurkse]],&lt;ref&gt;Nurkse, Ragnar (1953) ''Problems of Capital Formation in Underdeveloped Countries'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans Singer|Sir Hans Wolfgang Singer]]. Only after the war did economists turn their concerns towards Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the heart of these studies, by authors such as [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|W. Arthur Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.A. (1954). ''Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour. The Manchester School'', XXII(2), pp. 139–91.  [ftp://ftp.uic.edu/pub/depts/econ/wpaper/cchis/old%20docs533%20S07/Economic%20Development%20with%20Unlimited%20Supplies%20of%20Labour%20-%20Arthur%20Lewis.pdf Reprint.]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an analysis of not only economic growth but also structural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pranab Bardhan|Bardhan, Pranab K.]] and [[Christopher Udry]] (2000) ''Development Microeconomics'', Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear-stages-of-growth model===
An early theory of development economics, the linear-stages-of-growth model was first formulated in the 1950s by [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]] in ''The Stages of Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,'' following work of Marx and List.  This theory modifies Marx's stages theory of development and focuses on the accelerated accumulation of capital, through the utilization of both domestic and international savings as a means of spurring investment, as the primary means of promoting economic growth and, thus, development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;  The linear-stages-of-growth model posits that there are a series of five consecutive stages of development which all countries must go through during the process of development.  These stages are "the traditional society, the pre-conditions for take-off, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of high mass-consumption"&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, W.W. "The Five Stages of Growth". ''Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality''. 3rd ed. pp. 123–31. Eds. Seligson, Mitchell and John Passe-Smith.  Boulder, CO: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple versions of the [[Harrod–Domar model]] provide a mathematical illustration of the argument that improved capital investment leads to greater economic growth.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Such theories have been criticized for not recognizing that, while necessary, [[capital accumulation]] is not a sufficient condition for development. That is to say that this early and simplistic theory failed to account for political, social and institutional obstacles to development.  Furthermore, this theory was developed in the early years of the [[Cold War]] and was largely derived from the successes of the [[Marshall Plan]].  This has led to the major criticism that the theory assumes that the conditions found in developing countries are the same as those found in post-WWII Europe.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Structural-change theory===

Structural-change theory deals with policies focused on changing the economic structures of developing countries from being composed primarily of subsistence agricultural practices to being a "more modern, more urbanized, and more industrially diverse manufacturing and service economy."  There are two major forms of structural-change theory: W. Lewis' ''two-sector surplus model'', which views agrarian societies as consisting of large amounts of surplus labor which can be utilized to spur the development of an urbanized industrial sector, and Hollis Chenery's ''patterns of development'' approach, which holds that different countries become wealthy via different trajectories.  The ''pattern'' that a particular country will follow, in this framework, depends on its size and resources, and potentially other factors including its current income level and comparative advantages relative to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. (1960). "Patterns of Industrial Growth," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812463 ''The American Economic Review'', 50(4), pp. 624–54]. American Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. and Taylor, L. (1968). "Development Patterns: Among Countries and Over Time," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1926806 ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', 50(4), pp. 391–416]. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical analysis in this framework studies the "sequential process through which the economic, industrial and institutional structure of an underdeveloped economy is transformed over time to permit new industries to replace traditional agriculture as the engine of economic growth."&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Structural-change approaches to development economics have faced criticism for their emphasis on urban development at the expense of rural development which can lead to a substantial rise in inequality between internal regions of a country.  The two-sector surplus model, which was developed in the 1950s, has been further criticized for its underlying assumption that predominantly agrarian societies suffer from a surplus of labor.  Actual empirical studies have shown that such labor surpluses are only seasonal and drawing such labor to urban areas can result in a collapse of the agricultural sector.  The patterns of development approach has been criticized for lacking a theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===International dependence theory===
International [[dependency theory|dependence theories]] gained prominence in the 1970s as a reaction to the failure of earlier theories to lead to widespread successes in [[international development]].  Unlike earlier theories, international dependence theories have their origins in developing countries and view obstacles to development as being primarily external in nature, rather than internal.  These theories view developing countries as being economically and politically dependent on more powerful, developed countries which have an interest in maintaining their dominant position.  There are three different, major formulations of international dependence theory: [[neocolonial dependence]] theory, the false-paradigm model, and the dualistic-dependence model.
The first formulation of international dependence theory, neocolonial dependence theory, has its origins in [[Marxism]] and views the failure of many developing nations to undergo successful development as being the result of the historical development of the international capitalist system.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Neoclassical theory===
First gaining prominence with the rise of several conservative governments in the developed world during the 1980s, neoclassical theories represent a radical shift away from International Dependence Theories.  Neoclassical theories argue that governments should not intervene in the economy; in other words, these theories are claiming that an unobstructed free market is the best means of inducing rapid and successful development.  Competitive [[free markets]] unrestrained by excessive government regulation are seen as being able to naturally ensure that the allocation of resources occurs with the greatest efficiency possible and the economic growth is raised and stabilized.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

It is important to note that there are several different approaches within the realm of neoclassical theory, each with subtle, but important, differences in their views regarding the extent to which the market should be left unregulated.  These different takes on neoclassical theory are the ''free market approach'', ''public-choice theory'', and the ''market-friendly approach''.  Of the three, both the free-market approach and public-choice theory contend that the market should be totally free, meaning that any intervention by the government is necessarily bad.  Public-choice theory is arguably the more radical of the two with its view, closely associated with [[libertarianism]], that governments themselves are rarely good and therefore should be as minimal as possible.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Academic economists have given varied policy advice to governments of developing countries. See for example, [[Economy of Chile]] ([[Arnold Harberger]]), [[Economic history of Taiwan]] ([[Sho-Chieh Tsiang]]). [[Anne Krueger]] noted in 1996 that success and failure of policy recommendations worldwide had not consistently been incorporated into prevailing academic writings on trade and development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

The market-friendly approach, unlike the other two, is a more recent development and is often associated with the [[World Bank]]. This approach still advocates free markets but recognizes that there are many imperfections in the markets of many developing nations and thus argues that some government intervention is an effective means of fixing such imperfections.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

==Topics of research==
Development economics also includes topics such as [[Debt of developing countries|third world debt]], and the functions of such organisations as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]].  In fact, the majority of development economists are employed by, do consulting with, or receive funding from institutions like the IMF and the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. and DiCola, Therese. "[http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/KleinDiColasInvestigatingAugust2004.pdf Institutional Ties of ''Journal of Development Economics'' Authors and Editors]". (August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such economists are interested in ways of promoting stable and sustainable growth in poor countries and areas, by promoting domestic self-reliance and education in some of the lowest income countries in the world. Where economic issues merge with social and political ones, it is referred to as [[development studies]].

===Economic development and ethnicity===
A growing body of research has been emerging among development economists since the very late 20th century focusing on interactions between [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] and economic development, particularly at the level of the [[Nation state|nation-state]]. While most research looks at empirical economics at both the macro and the micro level, this field of study has a particularly heavy sociological approach. The more conservative branch of research focuses on tests for causality in the relationship between different levels of ethnic diversity and economic performance, while a smaller and more radical branch argues for the role of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] in enhancing or causing [[ethnic conflict]]. Moreover, comparing these two theoretical approaches brings the issue of [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogeneity]] (endogenicity) into questions. This remains a highly contested and uncertain field of research, as well as politically sensitive, largely due to its possible policy implications.

====The role of ethnicity in economic development====
Much discussion among researchers centers around defining and measuring two key but related variables: '''ethnicity''' and '''diversity'''. It is debated whether [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] should be defined by culture, language, or religion. While conflicts in [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]] were largely along tribal lines, [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigeria's string of conflicts]] is thought to be – at least to some degree – religiously based.&lt;ref&gt;Salawu, B. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad_Kamaldeen_IMAM-TAMIM/publication/235892778_ejss_13_3_02/links/0912f513ea7151f611000000/ejss-13-3-02.pdf Ethno-Religious Conflicts in Nigeria: Casual Analysis and Proposal for New Management Strategies]". ''European Journal of Social Sciences'' 13.3 (2010): 345–53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed that, as the [[Salience (language)|saliency]] of these different ethnic variables tends to vary over time and across geography, research methodologies should vary according to the context.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"&gt;Alesina, Alberto and [[Eliana La Ferrara]]. "Ethnic Diversity and Economic Performance". ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 43 (2005): 762–800. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somalia]] provides an interesting example. Due to the fact that about 85% of its population defined themselves as [[Somali people|Somali]], Somalia was considered to be a rather ethnically-homogeneous nation.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; However, [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] caused ethnicity (or ethnic affiliation) to be redefined according to [[clan]] groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt;

There is also much discussion in academia concerning the creation of an [[Index (economics)|index]] for "ethnic heterogeneity". Several indices have been proposed in order to model ethnic diversity (with regards to conflict). Easterly and Levine have proposed an ethno-linguistic fractionalization index defined as FRAC or ELF defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i^2,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; The ELF index is a measure of the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belong to different ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; Other researchers have also applied this index to religious rather than ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. "Ethnic and Cultural Diversity by Country". ''Journal of Economic Growth'' 8 (2003): 195–222. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Though commonly used, Alesina and La Ferrara point out that the ELF index fails to account for the possibility that fewer large ethnic groups may result in greater inter-ethnic conflict than many small ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; More recently, researchers such as Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, have put forward the ''Q'' [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] index as a more appropriate measure of ethnic division.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". Journal of Development Economics 76 (2005): ''293–323''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a simplified adaptation of a polarization index developed by Esteban and Ray, the ''Q'' index is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{\tfrac{1}{2} - s_i}{\tfrac{1}{2}}\right)^2 \times s_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' once again represents the size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population, and is intended to capture the social distance between existing ethnic groups within an area.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"/&gt;

Early researchers, such as Jonathan Pool, considered a concept dating back to the account of the Tower of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]: that linguistic unity may allow for higher levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"&gt;Pool, Jonathan. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/95c8/f417dd91510787a4d20ee5c429ffdafabc56.pdf National Development and Language Diversity]". ''Advances in the Sociology of Language'' 2 (1972): 213–30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While pointing out obvious oversimplifications and the subjectivity of definitions and data collection, Pool suggested that we had yet to see a robust economy emerge from a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; In his research Pool used the "size of the largest native-language community as a percentage of the population" as his measure of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; Not much later, however, Horowitz pointed out that both highly diverse and highly homogeneous societies exhibit less conflict than those in between.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. ''Ethnic groups in conflict.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Collier and Hoeffler provided evidence that both highly homogenous and highly heterogeneous societies exhibit lower risk of civil war, while societies that are more polarized are at greater risk.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"&gt;Collier, Paul and Anke Hoeffler. "[https://asso-sherpa.org/sherpa-content/docs/programmes/GDH/Campagne_RC/War.pdf On Economic Causes of Civil War]". ''Oxford Economic Papers'' 50 (1998): 563–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, their research suggests that a society with only two ethnic groups is about 50% more likely to experience civil war than either of the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"/&gt; Nonetheless, Mauro points out that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is positively correlated with corruption, which in turn is negatively correlated with economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, Paolo. "Corruption and Growth". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 110.3 (1995): 681–712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a study on economic growth in African countries, Easterly and Levine find that linguistic fractionalization plays a significant role in reducing national income growth and in explaining poor policies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". ''Journal of Development Economics'' 76 (2005): 293–323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dincer, Oguzhan C. and Fan Wang. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/53b8/d0147314c05e56c847a13a28bb9721ad5d8f.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Growth in China]". ''Journal of Economic Policy Reform'' 14.1 (2011): 1–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Empirical evidence|empirical research]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], at the [[Municipality|municipal]] level, has revealed that ethnic fractionalization (based on race) may be correlated with poor [[Fiscal policy|fiscal management]] and lower investments in [[public good]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alesina, Alberto, Reza Baqir and William Easterly. "Public Goods and Ethnic Divisions". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 114.4 (1999): 1243–84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, more recent research would propose that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is indeed negatively correlated with economic growth while more polarized societies exhibit greater public consumption, lower levels of investment and more frequent civil wars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Economic development and its impact on ethnic conflict====
Increasingly, attention is being drawn to the role of economics in ''spawning'' or ''cultivating'' '''ethnic conflict'''. Critics of earlier development theories, mentioned above, point out that “ethnicity” and ethnic conflict cannot be treated as exogenous variables.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub"&gt;Prasch, Robert E. "[http://rrp.sagepub.com/content/44/3/298 Neoliberalism and Ethnic Conflict]". ''Review of Radical Political Economics'' 44.3 (2012): 298–304. Web. Retrieved February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a body of literature which discusses how economic growth and development, particularly in the context of a [[Globalization|globalizing world]] characterized by [[free trade]], appears to be leading to the extinction and homogenization of languages.&lt;ref&gt;De Grauwe, Paul. "[http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/ew/academic/intecon/Degrauwe/PDG-Publications_recent.htm Language Diversity and Economic Development]". ''University of Leuven'' (January 2006). Working Paper. Web. Retrieved Feb 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Castells asserts that the "widespread destructuring of organizations, delegitimation of institutions, fading away of major social movements, and ephemeral cultural expressions" which characterize globalization lead to a renewed search for meaning; one that is based on identity rather than on practices.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel. "The Rise of the Network Society". ''The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture''. Vol. 1. Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber and Lewis argue that culturally-based [[Resistance movement|movements of resistance]] have emerged as a reaction to the threat of [[modernization]] (perceived or actual) and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/09/the-roots-of-muslim-rage/304643/ The Roots of Muslim Rage]". ''Atlantic Magazine'' (September 1990). Web. Retrieved February 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Benjamin R. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1992/03/jihad-vs-mcworld/303882/ Jihad vs. McWorld]". ''Atlantic Magazine'' (March 1992). Web. Retrieved February 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a different note, Chua suggests that ethnic conflict often results from the envy of the majority toward a wealthy minority which has benefited from trade in a neoliberal world.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; She argues that conflict is likely to erupt through political manipulation and the vilification of the minority.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; Prasch points out that, as economic growth often occurs in tandem with increased [[Economic inequality|inequality]], ethnic or religious organizations may be seen as both assistance and an outlet for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; However, empirical research by Piazza argues that economics and unequal development have little to do with [[Rebellion|social unrest]] in the form of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"&gt;Piazza, James A. "Rooted in Poverty?: Terrorism, Poor Economic Development, and Social Cleavages". ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' 18.1 (2006): 159–77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "more diverse societies, in terms of ethnic and religious [[demography]], and political systems with large, complex, multiparty systems were more likely to experience terrorism than were more homogeneous states with few or no parties at the national level".&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"/&gt;

====Recovery from conflict (civil war)====
Violent conflict and economic development are deeply intertwined. Paul Collier&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[[The Bottom Billion]]." ''The Bottom Billion'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how poor countries are more prone to civil conflict. The conflict lowers incomes catching countries in a "conflict trap." Violent conflict destroys physical capital (equipment and infrastructure), diverts valuable resources to military spending, discourages investment and disrupts exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul "[http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/1/168.abstract On the consequences of civil war]." ''Oxf. Econ. Pap.'' (1999) 51 (1): 168–83. doi: 10.1093/oep/51.1.168&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from civil conflict is very uncertain. Countries that maintain stability can experience a "peace dividend," through the rapid re-accumulation of physical capital (investment flows back to the recovering country because of the high return).&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/9508text.pdf Civil War and the Economics of the Peace Dividend]" Working Paper. Centre for the Study of African Economies (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, successful recovery depends on the quality of legal system and the protection of private property.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ces/journal/v56/n1/full/ces201328a.html "Investment and Institutions in Post Civil War Recovery]". ''Comparative Economic Studies'' 56, 1–24 (March 2014) | doi:10.1057/ces.2013.28&lt;/ref&gt; Investment is more productive in countries with higher quality institutions. Firms that experienced a civil war were more sensitive to the quality of the legal system that firm similar firms that had never been exposed to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2484629 Firm Investment Decisions in the Post Conflict Context]" forthcoming ''The Economics of Transition''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth indicator controversy==
Per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP per head) is used by many developmental economists as an approximation of general national well-being. However, these measures are criticized as not measuring economic growth well enough, especially in countries where there is much economic activity that is not part of measured financial transactions (such as housekeeping and self-homebuilding), or where funding is not available for accurate measurements to be made publicly available for other economists to use in their studies (including private and institutional fraud, in some countries).

Even though per-capita GDP as measured can make economic well-being appear smaller than it really is in some developing countries, the discrepancy could be still bigger in a developed country where people may perform outside of financial transactions an even higher-value service than housekeeping or homebuilding as gifts or in their own households, such as counseling, [[lifestyle coaching]], a more valuable home décor service, and time management. Even free choice can be considered to add value to lifestyles without necessarily increasing the financial transaction amounts.

More recent theories of Human Development have begun to see beyond purely financial measures of development, for example with measures such as medical care available, education, equality, and political freedom. One measure used is the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]], which relates strongly to theories of [[distributive justice]]. Actual knowledge about what creates growth is largely unproven; however recent advances in [[econometrics]] and more accurate measurements in many countries is creating new knowledge by compensating for the effects of variables to determine probable causes out of merely correlational statistics.

==Recent developments==
{{see also|Fair trade movement}}

The most prominent contemporary development economist is perhaps the [[Nobel laureate]], [[Amartya Sen]].

Recent theories revolve around questions about what variables or inputs correlate or affect economic growth the most: elementary, secondary, or higher education, government policy stability, tariffs and subsidies, fair court systems, available infrastructure, availability of medical care, prenatal care and clean water, ease of entry and exit into trade, and equality of income distribution (for example, as indicated by the [[Gini coefficient]]), and how to advise governments about macroeconomic policies, which include all policies that affect the economy.
Education enables countries to adapt the latest technology and creates an environment for new innovations.

The cause of limited growth and divergence in economic growth lies in the high rate of acceleration of technological change by a small number of developed countries. These countries' acceleration of technology was due to increased incentive structures for mass education which in turn created a framework for the population to create and adapt new innovations and methods. Furthermore, the content of their education was composed of secular schooling that resulted in higher productivity levels and modern economic growth.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] also highlight the importance of using economic growth to improve the human condition, raising people out of poverty and achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Claire Melamed, Kate Higgins and Andy Sumner (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief Economic growth and the MDGs] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite research showing almost no relation between growth and the achievement of the goals 2 to 7 and statistics showing that during periods of growth poverty levels in some cases have actually risen (e.g. Uganda grew by 2.5% annually between 2000–2003, yet poverty levels rose by 3.8%), researchers at the ODI suggest growth is necessary, but that it must be equitable.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; This concept of inclusive growth is shared even by key world leaders such as Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], who emphasises that:
:"Sustained and equitable growth based on dynamic structural economic change is necessary for making substantial progress in reducing poverty. It also enables faster progress towards the other Millennium Development Goals. While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
Researchers at the ODI thus emphasise the need to ensure [[social protection]] is extended to allow universal access and that active policy measures are introduced to encourage the private sector to create new jobs as the economy grows (as opposed to [[jobless growth]]) and seek to employ people from disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

The '''Emory Law School Supreme Court Advocacy Program''' (ELSSCAP) is an organization at [[Emory Law School]] dedicated to representing clients in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Formed in 2010, the project joined a growing class of [[Supreme Court Clinic]]s that provide expert representation under the guidance of experienced litigators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/rlazarus/docs/articles/Lazarus_YaleLJOnlineFinalPublishedArticle.pdf Docket Capture at the High Court]&lt;/ref&gt; ELSSCAP principally represents clients on petitions for writ of [[certiorari]], in opposition to certiorari, on the merits, or as [[amicus curiae]]. The program was founded by Professor David J. Bederman and Kedar Bhatia, then a first-year law student and now a contributor on [[SCOTUSblog|SCOTUSBlog.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/advocates/b/d/david_jeremy_bederman Oyez Profile for David J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering''' (IOF), also referred to as the Fraunhofer IOF, is an institute of the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research]] (FHG). The institute is based in [[Jena]]. Its activities are attributed to applied [[research and development]] in the branch of [[natural sciences]] in the field of [[optics]] and [[precision engineering]]. The institute was founded in 1992.

== Research and Development ==

Building upon the experience of the Jena region in the field of surface and thin film technologies for optics, the Fraunhofer IOF conducts research and development in the area of optical systems aiming at enhancing the control of light – from its generation and manipulation to its actual use. The combination of competences in the areas of optics and precision engineering is particularly important.

The focuses also result in the department structure:

* Optical layers
* Optical systems, Optical measurement
* Microoptical systems
* Precision Engineering
* see also: [[thin film]] technology, [[surface physics]], [[microstructure]] technology, [[nanotechnology]], microoptics, measurement technology

== CMN-Optics ==

In July 2006, the Fraunhofer IOF opened the Center for Advanced Micro- and Nano-Optics (CMN-Optics). The core of the facility is the SB350-OS [[electron beam lithography]] system. This device, also known as an "electron beam recorder", allows minimal structure sizes in the range of 50 nm with a high accuracy on substrate sizes up to 300 mm. The center is operated jointly with the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) of the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]]. The facility is also used by the [[IPHT Jena|Institute for Photonic Technologies]] (IPHT), Jena. The facility cost twelve million euros and was financed by the European Union, the Free State of Thuringia and the Fraunhofer Society.

== Cooperations ==

In 2003, the Fraunhofer Society concluded a cooperation agreement with the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. It is the basis for collaboration between Fraunhofer IOF staff and the staff of the Institute of Applied Physics at the University of Jena. The aim of the cooperation is to provide practical training for the students, to improve the implementation of research results into practice and to share the high-quality equipment and infrastructures of both institutions.

== Infrastructure ==

At the end of 2016, Fraunhofer IOF had 208 employees, most of whom are scientists and technicians.

The operating budget for the Fraunhofer IOF was EUR 22 million in the 2016 financial year. Basic funding covered 12 percent of the institute’s budget, of which 90 percent is financed by federal funds and 10 percent by state funds. Revenues from contract research in the industry brought in approximately 56 percent of the operating budget.

The Fraunhofer IOF has been headed by Andreas Tünnermann since 2003, who is also Director of the Institute of Applied Physics at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena.&lt;ref name="http://www.iap.uni-jena.de/Institute/People/Director-p-246.html"&gt;[http://www.iap.uni-jena.de/Institute/People/Director-p-246.html Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Andreas Tünnermann] - Official website of Institute of Applied Physics, Jena&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has excellently equipped laboratories on an area of 2550 m². Included are 860 m² of clean room class 10000 to 10 as well as a mechanics workshop that meets the highest requirements.

In the years 2002 and 2013 expansion facilities were built on the [[Beutenberg Campus]] in Jena.

In 2017 a fiber technology center was inaugurated at Fraunhofer IOF, which includes new special laboratories for the production of active and passive mirco- and nanostructured optical fibers and one of the world's most powerful fiber drawing towers. &lt;ref name="https://www.iof.fraunhofer.de/en/press/pressrelease/2017/25years.html"&gt;[https://www.iof.fraunhofer.de/en/press/pressrelease/2017/25years.html 25th institute anniversary: Fraunhofer IOF opens new fiber technology center in Jena] Fraunhofer IOF (Press Release, July 5, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

'''Friendly Floatees'''{{clarify|Where did "Friendly" come from? original package just says "Floatees"|date=December 2014}} are plastic bath toys marketed by [[The First Years, Inc]]. and made famous by the work of [[Curtis Ebbesmeyer]], an oceanographer who models [[ocean current]]s on the basis of [[flotsam]] movements. Ebbesmeyer studied the movements of a consignment of 29,000 Friendly Floatees—yellow ducks, red beavers, blue turtles and green frogs—which were washed into the Pacific Ocean in 1992. Some of the toys landed along Pacific Ocean shores, such as Hawaii. Others traveled over 17,000 miles, floating over the site where the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' sank, and spent years frozen in Arctic ice to reach the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], British and Irish shores 15 years later in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mail-1000s"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Clerkin |title=Thousands of rubber ducks to land on British shores after 15 year journey|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-464768/Thousands-rubber-ducks-land-British-shores-15-year-journey.html |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanography==
A consignment of Friendly Floatee toys, manufactured in China for The First Years Inc., departed from [[Hong Kong]] on a [[container ship]], the ''Ever Laurel'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hohn |first=Donovan |date=March 2011 |title=The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them |url= |location= |publisher= |isbn= 9780670022199 |accessdate= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; destined for [[Tacoma, Washington]]. On 10 January 1992, during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean close to the [[International Date Line]], twelve 40-foot (12-m) [[intermodal container]]s were washed overboard. One of these containers held 28,800 Floatees,&lt;ref name="Harper's"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Moby-Duck: Or, The Synthetic Wilderness of Childhood | last = Hohn | first = Donovan | date = January 2007 | publisher = [[Harper's Magazine]] | url = http://mysite.verizon.net/donovanhohn/Moby-Duck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a child's bath toy which came in a number of forms: red [[beaver]]s, green frogs, blue turtles and yellow [[rubber duck|duck]]s. At some point, the container opened (possibly because it collided with other containers or the ship itself) and the Floatees were released. Although each toy was mounted in a plastic housing attached to a backing card, subsequent tests showed that the cardboard quickly degraded in sea water allowing the Floatees to escape. Unlike many bath toys, Friendly Floatees have no holes in them so they do not take on water.

Seattle oceanographers Curtis Ebbesmeyer and James Ingraham, who were working on an ocean surface current model, began to track their progress. The mass release of 28,800 objects into the ocean at one time offered significant advantages over the standard method of releasing 500–1000 drift bottles. The recovery rate of objects from the Pacific Ocean is typically around 2%, so rather than the 10 to 20 recoveries typically seen with a drift bottle release, the two scientists expected numbers closer to 600. They were already tracking various other spills of flotsam, including 61,000 [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] running shoes that had been lost overboard in 1990.

Ten months after the incident, the first Floatees began to wash up along the [[Alaska]]n coast. The first discovery consisted of ten toys found by a [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] near [[Sitka, Alaska]] on 16 November 1992, about 2,000&amp;nbsp;miles&lt;!--are these really [[statute mile]]s, and if so, WHY?--&gt; (3,200&amp;nbsp;km) from their starting point. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham contacted beachcombers, coastal workers, and local residents to locate hundreds of the beached Floatees over a 530&amp;nbsp;mile (850&amp;nbsp;km) shoreline. Another beachcomber discovered twenty of the toys on 28 November 1992, and in total 400 were found along the eastern coast of the [[Gulf of Alaska]] in the period up to August 1993. This represented a 1.4% recovery rate. The landfalls were logged in Ingraham's computer model OSCUR (Ocean Surface Currents Simulation), which uses measurements of air pressure from 1967 onwards to calculate the direction of and speed of wind across the oceans, and the consequent surface currents. Ingraham's model was built to help fisheries but it is also used to predict flotsam movements or the likely locations of those lost at sea.

Using the models they had developed, the oceanographers correctly predicted further landfalls of the toys in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] in 1996 and theorized that many of the remaining Floatees would have travelled to [[Alaska]], westward to Japan, back to Alaska, and then drifted northwards through the [[Bering Strait]] and become trapped in the [[Arctic]] pack ice. Moving slowly with the ice across the Pole, they predicted it would take five or six years for the toys to reach the North Atlantic where the ice would thaw and release them. Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US [[savings bond]] reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in [[New England]], Canada or Iceland.&lt;ref name="Mail-1000s"/&gt; More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007. In July 2007, a retired teacher found a plastic duck on the Devon coast, and British newspapers mistakenly announced that the Floatees had begun to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title =  First of the plastic duck invasion fleet makes landfall on the Devon coast | date = 2000-07-14 | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2072458.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The First of the Duck Armada | last = Coles | first = John | date = 14 July 2007 | work = [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article246146.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the day after breaking the story, the Western Morning News, the local Devon newspaper, reported that Dr. Simon Boxall of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton had examined the specimen and determined that the duck was not in fact a Floatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Expert rules out toy duck as lost ocean adventurer | date = 14 July 2007 | publisher = ''Western Morning News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colors.

==Legacy==
At least two children's books have been inspired by the Floatees. In 1997, [[Houghton_Mifflin_Harcourt|Clarion Books]] published ''Ducky'' ({{ISBN|0-395-75185-3}}), written by [[Eve Bunting]] and illustrated by [[Caldecott_Medal|Caldecott Medal]] winner [[David Wisniewski]]. [[Hans_Christian_Andersen_Award|Hans Christian Andersen Award]] winner [[Eric Carle]] wrote ''10 Little Rubber Ducks'' (Harper Collins 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-00-720242-3}}).&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Carl|title=Ugly Ducklings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ea32a4-5732-11e1-be25-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1n2AiRVJ0|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Donovan Hohn]] published ''[[Moby-Duck|Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them]]'' (Viking, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02219-9}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea by Donovan Hohn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/moby-duck-toys-donovan-hohn |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2014, [[The Disney Channel]] and [[Disney Junior]] aired ''Lucky Duck'', a Canadian-American animated tv movie that is loosely based on and inspired by the Friendly Floatees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucky Duck |url=http://disneyjunior.com/lucky-duck |publisher=[[Disney Junior]] |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toys themselves have become collector's items, fetching prices as high as $1,000.

The role that gender plays as a risk factor for suicide has been studied extensively. While females show higher rates of non-fatal suicidal behavior and suicide ideation (thoughts),&lt;ref name="Krug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; and reportedly attempt suicide more frequently than males do,&lt;ref name=EB2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fava"/&gt; males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.&lt;ref name=Var2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO 2000-2012"/&gt;

As of recent World Health Organization ([[WHO]]) releases, challenges represented by [[social stigma]], the [[taboo]] to openly discuss suicide, and low availability of data are still to date obstacles leading to poor data quality for both suicide and suicide attempts: "given the sensitivity of suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death.".&lt;ref name="WHO_Suicide2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide - Challenges and obstacles |website=who.int |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/ |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |title=Self-directed violence|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/selfdirectedviolfacts.pdf |website=www.who.int |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many researchers have attempted to find explanations for why gender is such a significant indicator for suicide.
A common explanation relies on the social constructions of [[hegemonic masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. According to literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates are explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, risk-taking behavior, [[socioeconomic status|economic status]], [[individualism]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Payne, Sarah| title=The social construction of gender and its influence on suicide: a review of the literature | journal=Journal of Men's Health | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=23–35  | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875686708000146 | doi=10.1016/j.jomh.2007.11.002|display-authors=etal | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParadoxSuicidalProcess2011&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention]] |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.050 |authors=Schrijvers DL, Bollen J, Sabbe BG (Belgium) |date=6 May 2011 |title=Suicide Research: Selected Readings - The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process |volume= 6 (May 2011–October 2011) |pages=56–57 |url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/499348/SuicideResearchVol6.pdf#page=67 |pmid=21529962 |journal=J Affect Disord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="Moller" /&gt;

Numerous other factors have been put forward as the cause of the gender paradox. Part of the gap may be explained by heightened levels of stress that result from traditional gender roles. For example, the death of a spouse and [[divorce]] are risk factors for suicide in both genders, but the effect is somewhat mitigated for females.&lt;ref name="Divorce"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stack, Steven | title=New Micro-Level Data on the Impact of Divorce on Suicide, 1959–1980: A Test of Two Theories | journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume=52 | issue=1 | pages=119–127 | jstor=10.2307/352844 | doi=10.2307/352844 | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western world, females are more likely to maintain social and familial connections that they can turn to for support after losing their spouse.&lt;ref name="Divorce" /&gt; Another factor closely tied to gender roles is employment status. Males' vulnerability may be heightened during times of [[unemployment]] because of societal expectations that males should provide for themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Moller" /&gt;

It has been noted that the gender gap is less stark in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. One theory put forward for the smaller gap is the increased burden of motherhood due to cultural norms. In regions where the identity of females is constructed around the family, having young children may correlate with lower risks for suicide.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; At the same time, stigma attached to [[infertility]] or having children outside of marriage can contribute to higher rates of suicide among women.&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Girard, Chris | title=Age, Gender, and Suicide: A Cross-National Analysis | journal=American Sociological Review | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=553–574 | jstor=10.2307/2096076 | doi=10.2307/2096076 | year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a group of sociologists examined the gender and suicide gap by considering how cultural factors impacted suicide rates. The four cultural factors – power-distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity – were measured for 66 countries using data from the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; Cultural beliefs regarding individualism were most closely tied to the gender gap; countries that placed a higher value on individualism showed higher rates of male suicide. Power-distance, defined as the social separation of people based on finances or status, was negatively correlated with suicide. However, countries with high levels of power-distance had higher rates of female suicide.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; The study ultimately found that stabilizing cultural factors had a stronger effect on suicide rates for women than men.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rudmin, Lloyd Webster | title=Questions of Culture, Age, and Gender in the Epidemiology of Suicide | journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]] | volume=44 | pages=373–381 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9450.00357/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false | doi=10.1111/1467-9450.00357 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differing methods by gender ===
{{Main|Suicide methods}}
The reported difference in suicide rates for males and females is partially a result of the methods used by each gender. Although females attempt suicide at a higher rate,&lt;ref name=EB2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fava"/&gt; they are more likely to use methods that are less immediately lethal.&lt;ref name=Sue2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Males frequently complete suicide via high mortality actions such as hanging, carbon-monoxide poisoning, and firearms. This is in contrast to females, who tend to rely on drug overdosing.&lt;ref name="gender paradox"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schrijvers, Didier | title=The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process | journal=Journal of Affective Disorders | volume=138 | issue=2 | pages=19–26 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.050 | pmid=21529962 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While overdosing can be deadly, it is less immediate and therefore more likely to be caught before death occurs. In Europe, where the gender discrepancy is the greatest, a study found that the most frequent method of suicide among both genders was hanging; however, the use of hanging was significantly higher in males (54.3%) than in females (35.6%). The same study found that the second most common methods were firearms (9.7%) for men and poisoning by drugs (24.7%) for women.&lt;ref name="suicide methods" /&gt;

=== Preventive strategies ===
In the United States, both the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] address different methods of reducing suicide, but do not recognize the separate needs of males and females.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; In 2002, the English Department of Health launched a suicide prevention campaign that was aimed at high-risk groups including young men, prisoners, and those with mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; The [[Campaign Against Living Miserably]] is a charity in the UK that attempts to highlight this issue for public discussion. Some studies have found that because young females are at a higher risk of attempting suicide, policies tailored towards this demographic are most effective at reducing overall rates. Researchers have also recommended more aggressive and long-term treatments and follow up for males that show indications of suicidal thoughts. Shifting cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] and norms, and especially ideas about masculinity, may also contribute to closing the gender gap.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thompson, Martie| title=Examining Gender Differences in Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts Made 1 and 7 Years Later in a Nationally Representative Sample | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health | volume=48 | pages=391–397 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1000368X | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.07.018|display-authors=etal | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of completed suicide is vastly higher among males than females among all age groups in most of the world. As of 2015, almost two-thirds of worldwide suicides (representing about 1.5% of all deaths) are committed by men.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Since the 1950s, typically males have died from suicidal attempts three to five times more often than females.&lt;ref name="1950sUSstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaths by suicide per 100,000 resident population in the United States from 1950 to 2015, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/|publisher=statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyfirstaid.org/suicide.html|title=Teen Suicide Statistics|year=2001|publisher=FamilyFirstAid.org|work=Adolescent Teenage Suicide Prevention|accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Less likely"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Murphy, George E. | title=Why Women are Less Likely Than Men to Commit Suicide | journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=165–175 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X98900578 | doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(98)90057-8 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of mental health resources may be a significant contributor to the gender difference in suicide rates in the US. Studies have shown that females are 13–21% more likely than males to receive a psychiatric affective diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Kung"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kung, Hsiang-Ching| title=Risk factors for male and female suicide decedents ages 15–64 in the United States | journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume=38 | issue=8 | pages=419–426 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-003-0656-x#page-1 | doi=10.1007/s00127-003-0656-x|display-authors=etal | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 72–89% of females who committed suicide had contact with a mental health professional at some point in their life and 41–58% of males who committed suicide had contact with a mental health professional.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;

Within the United States, there are variances in gendered rates of suicide by ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldston|first=David B.|author2=Sherry Davis Molock |author3=Leslie B. Whitbeck |author4=Jessica L. Murakami |author5=Luis H. Zayas |author6=Gordon C. Nagayama Hall |title=Cultural Considerations in Adolescent Suicide Prevention and Psychosocial Treatment|journal=American Psychologist|volume=63|issue=1|pages=14–31|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/63/1/14.html|accessdate=22 April 2013|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.63.1.14 |pmid=18193978 |pmc=2662358 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CDC, as of 2013 the suicide rates of Whites and American Indians are more than twice the rates of African Americans and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|title=Suicide Statistics|work=AFSP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations for why rates of attempted and completed suicide vary by ethnicity are often based on cultural differences. Among African American suicides, it has been suggested that females usually have better access to communal and familial relations that may mitigate other risk factors for suicide. Among Hispanic populations, the same study showed that cultural values of ''[[marianismo]]'', which emphasizes female docility and deference to males, may help explain the higher rate of suicide of Latinas relative to Latinos.&lt;ref name="Cultural" /&gt; The authors of this study did not extrapolate their conclusions on ethnicity to populations outside the United States.

=== Europe ===
The gender-suicide gap is generally highest in Western countries. Among the nations of Europe, the gender gap is particularly large in Eastern European countries such as [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Hungary]]. Some researchers attribute the higher rates in former Soviet countries to be a remnant of recent political instability. An increased focus on family led to females becoming more highly valued. Rapid economic fluctuations prevented males from providing fully for their families, which prevented them from fulfilling their traditional gender role. Combined, these factors could account for the gender gap.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Möller-Leimkühler, Anne Maria  | title=The gender gap in suicide and premature death or: why are men so vulnerable?  | journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience  | volume=253  | issue=1 | pages= 1–8 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-003-0397-6#page-1 | doi=10.1007/s00406-003-0397-6 | pmid=12664306 | date=Feb 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suicide methods"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Varnik, A| title=Suicide methods in Europe: a gender-specific analysis of countries participating in the ''European Alliance Against Depression'' | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health | volume=62 | pages=545–551 | url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/62/6/545.short | issue=6 | doi=10.1136/jech.2007.065391|display-authors=etal | year=2008| pmc=2569832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that higher instances of alcoholism among males in these nations may be to blame.&lt;ref name="Alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Landburg, Jonas | title=Alcohol and Suicide in eastern Europe | journal=Centre for Social Research on Alcohol and Drugs | volume=27 | pages=361–373| url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09595230802093778 | doi=10.1080/09595230802093778 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, suicides rates amongst under-45 men in UK reached a 15-year high of 78% of the total 5,140.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'A crisis of masculinity': men are struggling to cope with life | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11238596/A-crisis-of-masculinity-men-are-struggling-to-cope-with-life.html|date=19 Nov 2014| accessdate = 2014-11-20 | publisher = The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Western nations ===
A higher male mortality from suicide is also evident from data of non-Western countries: the [[Caribbean]], often considered part of the [[Western World|West]] is the most prominent example. In 1979–81, out of 74 countries with a non-zero suicide rate, 69 countries had male suicide rates greater than females, two reported equal rates for the sexes ([[Seychelles]] and [[Kenya]]), while three reported female rates exceeding male rates ([[Papua New Guinea]], [[Macau]], and [[French Guiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Patterns, Table 3.3, pp. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast is even greater today, with WHO statistics showing China as the only country where the suicide rate of females matches or exceeds that of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122021659/http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |archivedate=January 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barraclough found that the female rates of those aged 5–14 equaled or exceeded the male rates only in 14 countries, mainly in [[South America]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barraclough BM |title=Sex ratio of juvenile suicide |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=434–5 |year=1987 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085670965704X |doi=10.1097/00004583-198705000-00027 |pmid=3496328 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In most countries, the majority of committed suicides are made by men but, in China, women are more likely to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011"&gt;Barlow, D. H., and V. M. Durand. Abnormal psychology, an integrative approach. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 China's ratio was around 8 males for every 10 females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Suicide rates, age-standardized Data by country|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en|publisher=WHO|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional gender roles in China hold women responsible for keeping the family happy and intact. Suicide for women in China is shown in literature to be an acceptable way to avoid disgrace that may be brought to themselves or their families.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011" /&gt;  According to a 2002 review, the most common reasons for the difference in rate between genders are: "the lower status of Chinese women, love, marriage, marital infidelity, and family problems, the methods used to commit suicide, and mental health of Chinese women."&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;  Another explanation for increased suicide in women in China is that pesticides are easily accessible and tend to be used in many suicide attempts made by women.&lt;ref name=Zhang2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J|last2=Jiang|first2=C|last3=Jia|first3=S|last4=Wieczorek|first4=WF|title=An Overview of Suicide Research in China.|journal=Archives of Suicide Research |date=2002|volume=6|issue=2|pages=167–184|doi=10.1080/13811110208951174|pmid=20686645|pmc=2913725}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of nonlethal suicidal behavior is 40 to 60 percent higher in women than it is in men. This is due to the fact that more women are diagnosed as depressed than men, and also that depression is correlated with suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011" /&gt;

The term ''gnome'' was introduced by [[Klaus Berger (theologian)|Klaus Berger]] in the ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments''. He used this traditional term from the antique rhetoric and attempted to identify this rhetorical method in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, K.  1984  ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments'' (Heidelberg: Quelle &amp;  Meyer). 1987 Einführung in die Formgeschichte (UTB, 144; Tübingen: Franke).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful. Joyce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=P|title=The Rule of Freedom: Liberalism and the Modern City|year=2003|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenges Foucauldian notions of Panopticism, contending that neoliberal governmentality is more adequately conceptualised by an omniopticon - 'the many surveilling the many'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S|author2=Leszczy, L|title=Privacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb|journal=Geoforum|year=2010|volume=42|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative mapping]] initiatives utilising [[GPS]] technology are arguably omniopticons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingsbury|first=P|author2=Jones, J.P|title=Walter Benjamin's Dionysian Adventures on Google Earth|journal=Geoforum|year=2009|volume=40|issue=4|pages=502–513|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to reverse the panoptic [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Natios |first=D |title=Reversing the Panopticon |url=http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |accessdate=29 October 2011 |author2=Young, Y |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211004/http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to health care ===

(2004) Governmentality by Network in English Primary Care. Social Policy and Administration 70, 779-86.&lt;/ref&gt; have recently suggested that the concept of governmentality may be useful in explaining the operation of evidence-based health care and the internalization of clinical guidelines relating to best practice for patient populations, such as those developed by the American Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).  Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

'''Green consumption''', is closely related to the notions of [[sustainable development]] or [[sustainable consumer behaviour]]. It is a form of consumption that is compatible with the safeguard of the environment for the present and for the next generations. It is a concept which ascribes to consumers responsibility or co-responsibility for addressing environmental problems through adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors, such as the use of organic products, clean and [[renewable energy]] and the research of goods produced by companies with zero, or almost, impact.&lt;ref&gt;J. Connoly, A. Prothero, 2008, Green consumption: life-politics, risk and contradictions, Journal of consumer culture, vol. 8, pp. 117-145&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Western societies, during the ‘60s and the early ‘70s, the necessity to protect the environment and the people health from the effects caused by industrial pollutants and by the continuous growth of economic and population has developed this new idea of consumption. In the 1980s first American "green" brands began to appear and exploded on the American market. During the 1990s green products had a slow mild growth, remaining a niche phenomenon. American interest in green products . started to increase again in the early 2000s with greater speed and, despite the latest recession, it has been continuing to grow.&lt;ref&gt;R.Elliott, 2013, The taste for green:the possibilities and dynamics of status differentiation through "green" consumption, Sci Verse ScienceDirect, ELSEVIER, vol. 41, pp. 294-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development ==
The origin of the necessity to behave in an environmental-friendly way goes back to the 1960s and '70s. In particular after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]], Western countries start to think about the use of renewable energy, as an alternative to fuel fossil. Nowadays green consumption is considered a basic point of environmental reform and it is also guarantee by supra-national organizations like European Union.  Some sociologist argue that after the increasing [[globalization]], people feel more interconnected with other people and the environment, so there has been increasing awareness of global [[environmental problems]], especially in western countries. 
The main forums in which the issue has been discussed, and provided guidelines to orient national governments are: [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment]]; [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#World Conservation Strategy|IUCN 1980 World Conservation Strategy]]; [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983 and 1987 Brundtland Report]]; Italy 1993 National Plan for Sustainable Development; Aalborg 1994, 1st European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Lisbon 1996, 2nd European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Hannover 2000, 3rd Conference on Sustainable Cities; European Union in 2001, VI Environmental Action Plan 2002/2010; Aalborg +10 and the Aalborg Commitments in 2004.

== Pro-environmental behavior ==
Green consumer behavior is a form of pro-environmental behavior, which can be defined as a form of consumption that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment.&lt;ref&gt;L. Steg, C. Vlek, 2009, Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour: An integrative review and research agenda, Journal of environmental psychology, vol. 29, pp. 309-317&lt;/ref&gt; Past research has provided empirical support to the claim that green or pro-environmental consumer behavior is a multidimensional construct&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; which is composed of:

* "Private-sphere behavior" refers to the purchase, use and disposal of personal and household products that have environmental impact,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as automobiles, public transportation, or recycling&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Public-sphere behavior" refers to behavior that affects the environment directly through committed environmental activism or indirectly by influencing public policies,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as active involvement in environmental organizations and demonstrations (direct impact) or petitioning on environmental issues (indirect impact)&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual factors such as monetary incentives, costs, regulations, public policy norms, as well as subjectively perceived factors such as perceived resources available&lt;ref&gt;E. Olli, G. Grendstad, D. Wollebaek, 2001, Correlates of environmental behaviors: Bringing back social context, Environment and Behavior, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 181-208&lt;/ref&gt; have a strong impact on consumer pro-environmental behavior and thus green consumption through the mediating effect of attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, it is through attitude, that subjectively perceived contextual factors such as, for example, the extent to which consumers perceive having more or less time, money and power available, modulate pro-environmental behavior, in general, and green consumption, in particular.

== Green consumer behavior ==
We can define a green consumer behavior the one that has these characteristics:

* "purchase choice, product use and post-use, household management, collective, and consumer activism behaviors, reflecting some degree of environmental- related motivation";&lt;ref&gt;K. Peattie, 2010, Green consumption: behavior and norms, vol. 35, pp. 195-228&lt;/ref&gt;
* "purchase and use of products with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable products, recycled or reduced packaging, and low energy usage";&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;
* use of organic product, made with processes that provide [[energy saving]], then by the action of [[recycling]], in fact a green consumer is "one who purchase products and services perceived to have a positive (or less negative) influence on the environment […]"&lt;ref&gt;K. Haws, R. Walker Naylor, K. Page Winterich, 2013, Seeing the world through GREEN- tinted Glasses: Green Consumption Values and Responses to Environmentally Friendly Products, Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/ref&gt; 
We can find a green consumer behavior when an individual acts ethically, motivated not only by his/her personal needs, but also by the respect and preservation of the welfare of entire society, because a green consumer takes into account the environmental consequences (costs and benefits) of his/her private consumption. Green consumers are expected to be more conscientious in their use of assets, for example by using their goods without wasting resources. 
However the Eurobarometer’s survey of consumers’ behavior (2013) showed that consumers seem not to be fully conscious of the importance to adopt a set of new behaviors, that are more environmental-friendly. In this report it is possible to find that even though a very high proportion of citizens buy green products (80%), more than a half are classified as occasional maintenance (54%), and only a quarter are regular buyer of green products (26%).
This fact implies that most of people do not behave like green consumer continuously, probably because of a lot of social and economic constraints, such as the fact that green products are much more expensive than non-green ones, and also because it is not always so easy to find organic and [[biological]] goods for each category, and because the green-retailers are not so widespread. Some researchers find that personal values are influential determinants of consumption and that pro-environmental behavior might serve as a signal of personality dimension. Considering the time-horizon in the acquisition of green behavior, we can distinguish two types of consumers:

# prevention-type consumers, that feel a moral duty towards a greener lifestyle
# promotion-type, that are more focused on their aspirations and their dreams and don't strongly feel the pressure to quickly adjust their behavior in the direction of becoming more environmental-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bertoli, M. Bonera, A. Codini, E. Corvi, G. Miniero, 2014, Being green: from attitude to actual consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 521-528&lt;/ref&gt;
Another research find the effect of gender and [[social identity]] on green consumption: "female declared higher levels of sustainable consumption compared with male participants; however when social identity is salient, male increased their [[sustainable consumption]] intentions to the same level as female.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;  In this research are identified two kind of people, that have more:

# self-transcendent values, like woman, that are more willing to engage in sustainable consumption
# self-enhanced values, like men, that are less interested in green behavior

The fact is that sustainable consumption is, for men, a way to reinforce their social image, showing to others that they care about environment, instead for women is intrinsically important. The evidence is that green consumers are mainly female, aged between 30 and 44 years old, well educated, in a household with a high annual income.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on [[sustainable consumption]], International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principal areas of developed green consumption ==

=== [[Green energy]] ===
Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution.

=== Green food ===
In the food area, there is a recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food|local]] food.  
Organic food is produced through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and wormers common in intensive livestock farming. 
Consumers can also choose to buy local food in order to reduce the social and environmental impacts of "food miles" – the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seyfang, 2007, Growing sustainable consumption communities, The case of local organic food networks, International Journal of Sociology and social policy, vol. 27, pp. 120-134&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.

=== Green fashion ===
{{Main article|Sustainable fashion}}
''"Ethical clothing refers to clothing that takes into consideration the impact of production and trade on the environment and on the people behind the clothes we wear. Eco clothing refers to all clothing that has been manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. It includes organic textiles and sustainable materials such as hemp and non-textiles such as bamboo or recycled plastic bottles. It also includes recycled products (clothes made from recycled clothing including vintage, textile and other materials and can also be termed re-used) and is not necessarily made from organic fibers. Organic clothing means clothes that have been made with a minimum use of chemicals and with minimum damage to the environment and fair-trade is intended to achieve better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms for farmers and workers in the developing world".''&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The three main reasons that would motivate the purchase of organic cloths are:
* Environmental -friendly protection;
* Health impact;
* Ethical concerns.

Another important question is related to the textile and clothing industry that generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. 
Consumers are concerned about this (environmental) issues, and are best motivated to change their behaviors in a [[philanthropic]] or environmental-friendly actions that adapt with their financial and sustainability interests.
An intuitive and sustainable strategy is the reusing cloths. Textile recycling is a method of reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. This can reduce manufacturing pollution and [[resource consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. H. Hu, Q. Li, X. J. Chen, Y. F. Wang, 2014, Sustainable Rent-Based Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Fashion Products, Sustainability, vol. 6, pp. 7063-7088&lt;/ref&gt;  The world is facing one of the worst economic crises ever, which affects all industries, including fashion and luxury. In this way moderate consumption is becoming an implicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;  
Consumers pay attention to the origin and the materials of the clothes they buy and the fact that they are not harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton incorporated: http://www.cottoninc.com/corporate/Market-Data/SupplyChainInsights/consumer-perspectives-on-green-apparel/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the issue of trust arises and a label certifying the organic origin is strongly required. 
But consumers often have a lack of information of green fashion or maybe they are unaware of the existence of green fashion alternatives to traditional adult fashion. 
Thus, there is a need to create awareness and inform better the consumers on the nature of organic fashion.

{{Hermeticism}}
{{Spirituality sidebar |western |width=19.0em}}

'''Hermeticism''', also called '''Hermetism''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |last= Audi|first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521637228 |pages=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion|last=Reese |first=William L. |year=1980 |publisher=Harvester Press |location=Sussex |isbn=0855271477 |pages=108 and 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a religious, philosophical, and [[esoteric]] tradition based primarily upon writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] ("thrice-greatest Hermes").&lt;ref&gt;Churton p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; These writings have greatly influenced the [[Western esotericism|Western esoteric tradition]] and were considered to be of great importance during both the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hermeticism" ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Repristination Press, Texas: 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition claims descent from a ''[[prisca theologia]]'', a doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true [[theology]] that is present in all religions and that was given by God to man in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Yates, F. 1964, pp 14"&gt;Yates, F., ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Routledge, London, 1964, pp 14–18 and pp. 433–434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanegraaff, W. J. 1998, p 360"&gt;Hanegraaff, W. J., ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, p 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers, including [[Lactantius]], [[Cyprian of Carthage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Enoch in the Islamic Tradition|last = Jafar|first = Imad|date = 2015|journal = Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 53|volume =  36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.VIII.23.html Augustine, ''City of God'', 4.8.23,]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, F., ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Routledge, London, 1964, pp 9–15 and pp 61–66 and p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, J., "Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century", Repristination Press, Texas, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the importance of Hermeticism arises from its connection with the development of [[science]] during the time from 1300 to 1600&amp;nbsp;AD. The prominence that it gave to the idea of influencing or controlling nature led many scientists to look to [[Occult|magic]] and its allied arts (e.g., alchemy, astrology) which, it was thought, could put Nature to the test by means of experiments. Consequently, it was the practical aspects of Hermetic writings that attracted the attention of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Tambiah (1990), ''Magic, Science, Religion, and the scope of Rationality'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Newton]] placed great faith in the concept of an unadulterated, pure, ancient doctrine, which he studied vigorously to aid his understanding of the physical world.&lt;ref name="Tambiah 1990, 28"&gt;Tambiah (1990), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''Hermetic'' is from the medieval Latin ''hermeticus'', which is derived from the name of the Greek god [[Hermes]]. In English, it has been attested since the 17th century, as in "Hermetic writers" (e.g., [[Robert Fludd]]).

The word ''Hermetic'' was used by [[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]] in his English translation of ''The Pymander of Hermes'', published in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Collectanea Hermetica Edited by W. Wynn. Westcott Volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Anne Atwood mentioned the use of the word ''Hermetic'' by Dufresnoy in 1386.&lt;ref&gt;See Dufresnoy, ''Histoire del' Art Hermetique'', vol. iii. Cat. Gr. MSS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Suggestive Inquiry into Hermetic Philosophy and Alchemy by Mary Anne Atwood 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synonymous term ''Hermetical'' is also attested in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[Religio Medici]]'' of 1643 wrote: "Now besides these  particular and divided Spirits, there may be (for ought I know) a universal and common Spirit to the whole world. It was the opinion of Plato, and is yet of the Hermeticall Philosophers." (R. M. Part 1:2)

Hermes Trimegistus supposedly invented the process of making a glass tube airtight (a process in alchemy) using a secret seal. Hence, the term "completely sealed" is implied in "hermetically sealed" and the term "hermetic" is also equivalent to "occult" or hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hermetic|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Hermetica}}
[[File:Caduceus.svg|right|thumb|220px|The [[caduceus]], a symbol of Hermeticism.]]

===Late Antiquity===
{{Further|Hellenistic religion|Decline of Hellenistic polytheism}}
In [[Late Antiquity]], Hermetism&lt;ref&gt;van den Broek and Hanegraaff (1997) distinguish ''Hermetism'' in late antiquity from ''Hermeticism'' in the Renaissance revival.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in parallel with [[early Christianity]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], the [[Chaldaean Oracles]], and late [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] and [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] literature. These doctrines were "characterized by a resistance to the dominance of either pure rationality or doctrinal faith."&lt;ref&gt;van den Broek and Hanegraaff (1997), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The books now known as the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' were part of a renaissance of [[syncretism|syncretistic]] and intellectualized pagan thought that took place from the 3rd to the 7th century&amp;nbsp;AD. These post-Christian Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices such as the [[idolatry|veneration of images]]. Their predominant literary form is the [[dialogue]]: Hermes Trismegistus instructs a perplexed disciple upon various teachings of the hidden wisdom.

===Renaissance===
[[Plutarch]]'s mention of Hermes Trismegistus dates back to the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD, and [[Tertullian]], [[Iamblichus]], and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] were all familiar with Hermetic writings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan A. Hoeller, On the Trail of the Winged God—Hermes and Hermeticism Throughout the Age, Gnosis: A Journal of Western Inner Traditions (Vol. 40, Summer 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of falling out of favor, Hermeticism was reintroduced to the West when, in 1460, a man named Leonardo de Candia Pistoia&lt;ref&gt;This Leonardo di Pistoia was a monk {{cite web |url=http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/lib/coll.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101222307/http://www.ritmanlibrary.nl/c/p/lib/coll.html |archivedate=2007-01-01 |df= }}, not to be confused with the artist [[Leonardo da Pistoia]] who was not born until c. 1483 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; brought the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' to [[Pistoia]]. He was one of many agents sent out by Pistoia's ruler, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], to scour European monasteries for lost ancient writings.&lt;ref&gt;Salaman, Van Oyen, Wharton and Mahé,''The Way of Hermes'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1614, [[Isaac Casaubon]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Philology|philologist]], analyzed the Greek Hermetic texts for linguistic style. He concluded that the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were not the work of an ancient Egyptian priest but in fact dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Tambiah (1990), ''Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in light of Casaubon's linguistic discovery (and typical of many adherents of Hermetic philosophy in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries), Thomas Browne in his ''Religio Medici'' (1643) confidently stated: "The severe schools shall never laugh me out of the philosophy of Hermes, that this visible world is but a portrait of the invisible." (R.&amp;nbsp;M. Part 1:12)

In 1678, however, flaws in Casaubon's dating were discerned by Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a [[terminus ad quem]] and not a [[terminus a quo]]. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of alchemy clothed in philosophical metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html|title=Corpus Hermeticum|website=www.granta.demon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Walter Scott]] placed the date of the Hermetic texts shortly after 200&amp;nbsp;AD, but [[Flinders Petrie|W. Flinders Petrie]] placed their origin between 200 and 500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Abel and Hare p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In 1945, Hermetic texts were found near the Egyptian town [[Nag Hammadi Library|Nag Hammadi]]. One of these texts had the form of a conversation between Hermes and [[Asclepius]]. A second text (titled ''On the Ogdoad and Ennead'') told of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Hermetic mystery schools]]. It was written in the [[Coptic language]], the latest and final form in which the [[Egyptian language]] was written.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Geza Vermes]], Hermeticism was a Hellenistic mysticism contemporaneous with the Fourth Gospel, and Hermes Tresmegistos was "the Hellenized reincarnation of the Egyptian deity [[Thoth]], the source of wisdom, who was believed to deify man through knowledge (''gnosis'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=Christian Beginnings|accessdate=Feb 5, 2016|year=2012|publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Quispel]] says "It is now completely certain that there existed before and after the beginning of the Christian era in Alexandria a secret society, akin to a Masonic lodge. The members of this group called themselves 'brethren,' were initiated through a baptism of the Spirit, greeted each other with a sacred kiss, celebrated a sacred meal and read the Hermetic writings as edifying treatises for their spiritual progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quispel|first=Gilles|title=Preface to The Way of Hermes: New Translations of The Corpus Hermeticum and The Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius|translator-last1=Salaman|translator-first1=Clement|translator-last2=van Oyen|translator-first2=Dorine|translator-last3=Wharton|translator-first3=William D.|translator-last4=Mahé|translator-first4=Jean-Pierre|accessdate=Feb 5, 2016|date=2004|publisher=Inner Traditions|location=Rochester, Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Christian Bull argues that "there is no reason to identify [Alexandria] as the birthplace of a 'Hermetic lodge' as several scholars have done. There is neither internal nor external evidence for such an Alexandrian 'lodge', a designation that is alien to the ancient world and carries Masonic connotations."&lt;ref&gt;Bull 2018, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

In Hermeticism, the ultimate reality is referred to variously as God, the All, or the One. God in the Hermetica is unitary and transcendent: he is one and exists apart from the material cosmos. Hermetism is therefore profoundly monotheistic although in a [[deism|deistic]] and unitarian understanding of the term. "For it is a ridiculous thing to confess the World to be one, one Sun, one Moon, one Divinity, and yet to have, I know not how many gods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/pym/pym11.htm|title=The Divine Pymander: The Tenth Book, the Mind to Hermes|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its philosophy teaches that there is a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[God]], or Absolute, in which we and the entire [[universe]] participate. It also subscribes to the idea that other beings, such as [[aeons]], [[angel]]s and [[elemental]]s, exist within the universe.

Hermeticists believe in a ''prisca theologia'', the doctrine that a single, true theology exists, that it exists in all religions, and that it was given by God to man in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Yates, F. 1964, pp 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanegraaff, W. J. 1998, p 360"/&gt; In order to demonstrate the truth of the ''prisca theologia'' doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of [[Moses]]&lt;ref&gt;Yates, F., ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Routledge, London, 1964, p 27 and p 293&lt;/ref&gt; or the third in a line of men named Hermes—[[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Noah]], and the Egyptian priest-king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus.&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;Yates, F., ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Routledge, London, 1964, p52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, B.P., "Hermetica", Cambridge University Press, 1992, p xlviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="As above, so below"===
{{main|As above, so below}}
[[File:RWS Tarot 01 Magician.jpg|thumb|[[The Magician (Tarot)|The Magician]] displaying the Hermetic concept of "as above, so below".]]
The actual text of that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], as translated by Dennis W. Hauck from ''The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus'', is: "That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing."&lt;ref name="Scully p. 321"&gt;Scully p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, whatever happens on any level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) also happens on every other level.

This principle, however, is more often used in the sense of the [[Microcosm and Macrocosm|microcosm and the macrocosm]]. The microcosm is oneself, and the macrocosm is the universe. The macrocosm is as the microcosm and vice versa; within each lies the other, and through understanding one (usually the microcosm) a person may understand the other.&lt;ref&gt;Garstin p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe===

'''Alchemy''' (the operation of the [[Sun]]): Alchemy is not merely the [[chrysopoeia|changing]] of [[lead]] into [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall ''The Hermetic Marriage'' p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an investigation into the spiritual constitution, or life, of matter and material existence through an application of the mysteries of birth, death, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade ''[[The Forge and the Crucible]]'' p. 149 and p. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; The various stages of chemical [[distillation]] and [[fermentation]], among other processes, are aspects of these mysteries that, when applied, quicken nature's processes in order to bring a natural body to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Geber ''Summa Perfectionis''&lt;/ref&gt; This perfection is the accomplishment of the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|''magnum opus'']] (Latin for "Great Work").

'''Astrology''' (the operation of the [[star]]s): Hermes claims that [[Zoroaster]] discovered this part of the wisdom of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man.&lt;ref&gt;Powell pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hermetic thought, it is likely that the movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of [[The All]], or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained when we know what these influences are and how to deal with them.

'''Theurgy''' (the operation of the gods): There are two different types of magic, according to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's ''Apology'', completely opposite of each other. The first is [[Goetia|Goëtia]] (Greek: γοητεια), black magic reliant upon an alliance with evil spirits (i.e., demons). The second is [[Theurgy]], divine magic reliant upon an alliance with divine spirits (i.e., angels, archangels, gods).&lt;ref&gt;Garstin p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theurgy" translates to "The Science or Art of Divine Works" and is the practical aspect of the Hermetic art of alchemy.&lt;ref name="Garstin p. 6"&gt;Garstin p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, alchemy is seen as the "key" to theurgy,&lt;ref&gt;Garstin p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; the ultimate goal of which is to become united with higher counterparts, leading to the attainment of Divine Consciousness.&lt;ref name="Garstin p. 6"/&gt;

===Reincarnation===
[[Reincarnation]] is mentioned in Hermetic texts. Hermes Trismegistus asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O son, how many bodies have we to pass through, how many bands of demons, through how many series of repetitions and cycles of the stars, before we hasten to the One alone?&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Good and evil===
Hermes explains in Book 9 of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' that [[The All#Nous|nous]] (reason and knowledge) brings forth either good or evil, depending upon whether one receives one's perceptions from God or from [[demon]]s. God brings forth good, but demons bring forth evil. Among the evils brought forth by demons are: "adultery, murder, violence to one's father, sacrilege, ungodliness, strangling, suicide from a cliff and all such other demonic actions".&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

This provides evidence that Hermeticism includes a sense of morality. However, the word "good" is used very strictly. It is restricted to references to God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only God (in the sense of the nous, not in the sense of the All) who is completely free of evil. Men are prevented from being good because man, having a body, is consumed by his physical nature, and is ignorant of the Supreme Good.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus upon the [[Economic materialism|material life]] is said to be the only thing that offends God:

{{quote|As processions passing in the road cannot achieve anything themselves yet still obstruct others, so these men merely process through the universe, led by the pleasures of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' pp. 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One must create, one must do something positive in one's life, because God is a generative power. Not creating anything leaves a person "sterile" (i.e., unable to accomplish anything).&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Hermes'' p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmogony===
A [[Creation myth|creation story]] is told by God to Hermes in the first book of the ''Corpus Hermeticum''. It begins when God, by an act of will, creates the primary matter that is to constitute the [[cosmos]]. From primary matter God separates the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Then God orders the elements into the [[seven heavens]] (often held to be the spheres of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], the Sun, and the [[Moon]], which travel in circles and govern [[destiny]]).

"[[Logos|The Word]]" then leaps forth from the materializing four elements, which were unintelligent. Nous then makes the seven heavens spin, and from them spring forth creatures without speech. Earth is then separated from water, and animals (other than man) are brought forth.

The God then created [[Androgyny|androgynous]] man, in God's own image, and handed over his creation.

Man carefully observed the creation of nous and received from God man's authority over all creation. Man then rose up above the spheres' paths in order to better view creation. He then showed the form of the All to Nature. Nature fell in love with the All, and man, seeing his reflection in water, fell in love with Nature and wished to dwell in it. Immediately, man became one with Nature and became a slave to its limitations, such as [[sex]] and [[sleep]]. In this way, man became speechless (having lost "the Word") and he became "[[Fall of man|double]]", being mortal in body yet immortal in [[spirit]], and having authority over all creation yet subject to destiny.&lt;ref&gt;''The Poimandres''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative account====
An alternative account of the fall of man, preserved in the ''[[Discourses of Isis to Horus]]'', is as follows:

God, having created the universe, then created the divisions, the worlds, and various gods and goddesses, whom he appointed to certain parts of the universe. He then took a mysterious transparent substance, out of which he created human souls. He appointed the souls to the astral region, which is just above the physical region.

He then assigned the souls to create life on Earth. He handed over some of his creative substance to the souls and commanded them to contribute to his creation. The souls then used the substance to create the various animals and forms of physical life. Soon after, however, the souls began to overstep their boundaries; they succumbed to pride and desired to be equal to the highest gods.

God was displeased and called upon Hermes to create physical bodies that would imprison the souls as a punishment for them. Hermes created human bodies on earth, and God then told the souls of their punishment. God decreed that suffering would await them in the physical world, but he promised them that, if their actions on Earth were worthy of their divine origin, their condition would improve and they would eventually return to the heavenly world. If it did not improve, he would condemn them to repeated reincarnation upon Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk38iSa-hvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hermetica+volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=esfaUOuIMeSQ0QGy2oGoCQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Isis+to+Horus&amp;f=false|title=Hermetica[: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings which Contain Religious Or Philosophic Teachings Ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus.

==As a religion==
[[Tobias Churton]], Professor of [[Western Esotericism]] at the University of Exeter, states, "The Hermetic tradition was both moderate and flexible, offering a tolerant philosophical religion, a religion of the (omnipresent) mind, a purified perception of God, the cosmos, and the self, and much positive encouragement for the spiritual seeker, all of which the student could take anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Churton p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran Bishop [[James Heiser]] recently evaluated the writings of Marsilio Ficino and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] as an attempted "Hermetic Reformation".&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Repristination Press: Texas, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious and philosophical texts===
Hermeticists generally attribute 42 books to Hermes Trismegistus,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} although many more have been attributed to him. Most of them, however, are said to have been lost when the [[Great Library of Alexandria]] was destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

There are three major texts that contain Hermetic doctrines:
* '''''[[Hermetica|The Corpus Hermeticum]]''''' is the most widely known Hermetic text. It has 18 chapters, which contain dialogues between Hermes Trismegistus and a series of other men. The first chapter contains a dialogue between Poimandres (who is identified as God) and Hermes. This is the first time that Hermes is in contact with God. Poimandres teaches the secrets of the universe to Hermes. In later chapters, Hermes teaches others, such as his son Tat and Asclepius.
*'''''The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus''''' is a short work which contains a phrase that is well known in occult circles: "As above, so below." The actual text of that maxim, as translated by Dennis W. Hauck, is: "That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing".&lt;ref name="Scully p. 321"/&gt; The ''Emerald Tablet'' also refers to the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe. Hermes states that his knowledge of these three parts is the reason why he received the name Trismegistus ("Thrice Great" or "Ao-Ao-Ao" [which mean "greatest"]). As the story is told, the ''Emerald Tablet'' was found by [[Alexander the Great]] at [[Hebron]], supposedly in the tomb of Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;Abel &amp; Hare p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''The Perfect Sermon''''' (also known as ''The Asclepius'', ''The Perfect Discourse'', or ''The Perfect Teaching'') was written in the 2nd or 3rd century&amp;nbsp;AD and is a Hermetic work similar in content to ''The Corpus Hermeticum''.

Other important original Hermetic texts include the '''''Discourses of Isis to Horus''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dk38iSa-hvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hermetica+volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=esfaUOuIMeSQ0QGy2oGoCQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Isis%20to%20Horus&amp;f=false Walter Scott, ''Hermetica Volume 1'', pg 457]{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of a long dialogue between [[Isis]] and [[Horus]] on the fall of man and other matters; the '''''Definitions of Hermes to Asclepius''''';&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1JoqHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=way+of+hermes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D8jaULObKsKB0AGk2oGYCw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA Salaman, Van Oyen, Wharton and Mahé, ''The Way of Hermes'']&lt;/ref&gt; and many fragments, which are chiefly preserved in the anthology of [[Stobaeus]].

There are additional works that, while not as historically significant as the works listed above, have an important place in neo-Hermeticism:
* ''[[Kybalion|The Kybalion: Hermetic Philosophy]]'' is a book anonymously published in 1912 by three people who called themselves the "Three Initiates", and claims to expound upon essential Hermetic principles.
* ''A Suggestive Inquiry into Hermetic Philosophy and Alchemy'' was written by [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and originally published anonymously in 1850. This book was withdrawn from circulation by Atwood but was later reprinted, after her death, by her longtime friend Isabelle de Steiger. Isabelle de Steiger was a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]].

''A Suggestive Inquiry'' was used for the study of Hermeticism and resulted in several works being published by members of the Golden Dawn:&lt;ref&gt;"A Suggestive Inquiry into Hermetic Philosophy and Alchemy" with an introduction by Isabelle de Steiger&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Edward Waite]], a member and later the head of the Golden Dawn, wrote ''The Hermetic Museum'' and ''The Hermetic Museum Restored and Enlarged''. He edited ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus'', which was published as a two-volume set. He considered himself to be a Hermeticist and was instrumental in adding the word "Hermetic" to the official title of the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;"Hermetic Papers of A. E. Waite: the Unknown Writings of a Modern Mystic" Edited by R. A. Gilbert.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Wynn Westcott]], a founding member of the Golden Dawn, edited a series of books on Hermeticism titled ''Collectanea Hermetica''. The series was published by the [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical Publishing Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{" '}}The Pymander of Hermes' Volume 2, Collectanea Hermetica" published by The Theosophical Publishing Society in 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Initiation Into Hermetics]] is the title of the English translation of the first volume of Franz Bardon's three-volume work dealing with self-realization within the Hermetic tradition.

==Societies==
When Hermeticism was no longer endorsed by the Christian church, it was driven underground, and several Hermetic societies were formed. The [[western esoteric tradition]] is now steeped in Hermeticism. The work of such writers as [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], who attempted to reconcile [[Kabbalah|Jewish kabbalah]] and [[Christian mysticism]], brought Hermeticism into a context more easily understood by Europeans during the time of the Renaissance.

A few primarily Hermetic occult orders were founded in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance.

Hermetic magic underwent a 19th-century revival in [[Western Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Regardie p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was practiced by groups such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, [[Aurum Solis]], and [[Ragon]]. It was also practiced by individual persons, such as [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Arthur Machen]], [[Frederick Hockley]], and [[Kenneth M. Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Hermetic, or Hermetically influenced, groups exist today. Most of them are derived from [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Freemasonry]], or the Golden Dawn.

===Rosicrucianism===
{{Main article|Rosicrucianism}}
Rosicrucianism is a movement which incorporates the Hermetic philosophy. It dates back to the 17th century. The sources dating the existence of the Rosicrucians to the 17th century are three German pamphlets: the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis|Fama]]'', the ''[[Confessio Fraternitatis]]'', and ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Yates  | first = Frances  | author-link = Frances_Yates
  | title = The Rosicrucian Enlightenment
  | place = London  | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul
  | year = 1972  | isbn = 0-7100-7380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars believe these to be hoaxes and say that later Rosicrucian organizations are the first actual appearance of a Rosicrucian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html|title=Prof. Carl Edwin Lindgren, "The Rose Cross, A Historical and Philosophical View"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108052032/http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html|archivedate=2012-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is hard to sustain given that original copies are in existence, including a ''Fama Fraternitatis'' at the University of Illinois and another in the New York Public Library. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Rosicrucian Order consists of a secret inner body and a public outer body that is under the direction of the inner body. It has a graded system in which members move up in rank and gain access to more knowledge. There is no fee for advancement. Once a member has been deemed able to understand the teaching, he moves on to the next higher grade.

The ''Fama Fraternitatis'' states that the Brothers of the Fraternity are to profess no other thing than "to cure the sick, and that gratis".

The Rosicrucian spiritual path incorporates [[philosophy]], kabbalah, and divine magic.

The Order is symbolized by the [[rose]] (the soul) and the [[cross]] (the body). The unfolding rose represents the human soul acquiring greater consciousness while living in a body on the material plane.

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===
{{Main article|Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn}}
[[File:Rose_Cross_Lamen.svg|thumb|Rose Cross of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]
Unlike the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]], the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was open to both sexes and treated them as equals. The Order was a specifically Hermetic society that taught alchemy, kabbalah, and the magic of Hermes, along with the principles of occult science.

The Golden Dawn maintained the tightest of secrecy, which was enforced by severe penalties for those who disclosed its secrets. Overall, the general public was left oblivious of the actions, and even of the existence, of the Order, so few if any secrets were disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie pp. 15–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its secrecy was broken first by [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1905 and later by [[Israel Regardie]] in 1937. Regardie gave a detailed account of the Order's teachings to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardie had once claimed that there were many occult orders which had learned whatever they knew of magic from what had been leaked from the Golden Dawn by those whom Regardie deemed "renegade members".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The [[Stella Matutina]] was a successor society of the Golden Dawn.

===Esoteric Christianity===
Hermeticism remains influential within [[esoteric Christianity]], especially in [[Martinism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Influential 20th century and early 21st century writers in the field include [[Valentin Tomberg]] and [[Sergei O. Prokofieff]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The Kybalion somewhat explicitly owed itself to Christianity, and the [[Meditations on the Tarot]] was one important book illustrating the theory and practice of [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian Hermeticism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Mystical Neopaganism===
Hermeticism remains influential within [[Modern paganism|Neopaganism]], especially in [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''[[Biotechnology]]''' is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bud|first1=Robert|last2=Cantley|first2=Mark F.|title=The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=9780521476997|pages=1, 6, 7, 30, 133, 135, 138, 141–142, 155, 171–173, 165, 167, 174, 177, &amp; 191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGFQNf_PcPwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, biotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now most often associated with the development of [[drug]]s, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as [[malnutrition]] and [[famine]]. The history of [[biotechnology]] begins with [[Zymology|zymotechnology]], which commenced with a focus on [[brewing]] techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of [[industrial fermentation]] gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.

Yet the formation of a new field, [[genetic engineering]], would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the [[Asilomar Conference]], where [[Joshua Lederberg]] was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human [[insulin]], Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.

The field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society with the advent of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell research]], [[cloning]], and [[genetically modified food]]. While it seems only natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.

==Origins of biotechnology==
Biotechnology arose from the field of zymotechnology or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, [[brewing]] contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government.&lt;ref name="Thackray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackray|first1=Arnold|title=Private Science: Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812234282|pages=6–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUX5DUTldwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.

The heyday and expansion of zymotechnology came in World War I in response to industrial needs to support the war. [[Max Delbrück (chemist)|Max Delbrück]] grew yeast on an immense scale during the war to meet 60 percent of Germany's animal feed needs.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; Compounds of another fermentation product, [[lactic acid]], made up for a lack of hydraulic fluid, [[glycerol]]. On the Allied side the Russian chemist [[Chaim Weizmann]] used starch to eliminate Britain's shortage of [[acetone]], a key raw material for [[cordite]], by fermenting maize to acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sifniades|first1=Stylianos|last2=Levy|first2=Alan B.|title=Acetone|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_079|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial potential of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] was outgrowing its traditional home in brewing, and "zymotechnology" soon gave way to "biotechnology."

With food shortages spreading and resources fading, some dreamed of a new industrial solution. The Hungarian [[Károly Ereky]] coined the word "biotechnology" in Hungary during 1919 to describe a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also a fattening farm with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. In a book entitled ''Biotechnologie'', Ereky further developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term "biotechnologie" indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products.&lt;ref name="Fiechter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiechter|first1=A.|last2=Beppu|first2=T.|title=History of Modern Biotechnology I|date=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540677932|pages=153 &amp; 170|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ha6RNLb_UFQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This catchword spread quickly after the First World War, as "biotechnology" entered German dictionaries and was taken up abroad by business-hungry private consultancies as far away as the United States. In Chicago, for example, the coming of [[prohibition]] at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the "Bureau of Biotechnology," which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The belief that the needs of an industrial society could be met by fermenting agricultural waste was an important ingredient of the "chemurgic movement."&lt;ref name="Fiechter" /&gt;  Fermentation-based processes generated products of ever-growing utility. In the 1940s, [[penicillin]] was the most dramatic. While it was discovered in England, it was produced industrially in the U.S. using a deep fermentation process originally developed in Peoria, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J.

Doctors used the phrase "miracle drug", and the historian of its wartime use, David Adams, has suggested that to the public penicillin represented the perfect health that went together with the car and the dream house of wartime American advertising.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt;  Beginning in the 1950s, fermentation technology also became advanced enough to produce [[steroids]] on industrially significant scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capek|first1=Milantadra|last2=Oldrich|first2=Hanc|last3=Alois|first3=Capek|title=Microbial Transformations of Steroids|date=1966|publisher=Academia Publishing House of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|location=Prague|isbn=9789401176057|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was the improved [[semisynthesis]] of [[cortisone]] which simplified the old 31 step synthesis to 11 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leigh|first1=H.

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|left| [[Penicillin]] was viewed as a miracle drug that brought enormous profits and public expectations.]]

==Single-cell protein and gasohol projects==
Even greater expectations of biotechnology were raised during the 1960s by a process that grew single-cell protein. When the so-called protein gap threatened world hunger, producing food locally by growing it from waste seemed to offer a solution. It was the possibilities of growing microorganisms on oil that captured the imagination of scientists, policy makers, and commerce.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Major companies such as [[British Petroleum]] (BP) staked their futures on it. In 1962, BP built a pilot plant at Cap de Lavera in Southern France to publicize its product, Toprina.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Initial research work at Lavera was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]],&lt;ref name=bamberg&gt;{{cite book|first=J. H. |last=Bamberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000|pages=426–428|isbn=978-0-521-78515-0|title=British Petroleum and global oil, 1950-1975: the challenge of nationalism.

Bamberg British Petroleum series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVC0VlPOJxEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, construction started on BP's second pilot plant at [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth Oil Refinery]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=bamberg/&gt;

As there was no well-accepted term to describe the new foods, in 1966 the term "[[single-cell protein]]" (SCP) was coined at [[MIT]] to provide an acceptable and exciting new title, avoiding the unpleasant connotations of microbial or bacterial.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The "food from oil" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, when  facilities for growing yeast fed by n-[[Alkane|paraffin]]s were built in a number of countries. The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were particularly enthusiastic, opening large "BVK" (''belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat'', i.e., "protein-vitamin concentrate") plants next to their oil refineries in [[Kstovo]] (1973) &lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C55137B93C2A8178AD95F478785F9 Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved], By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kstovo.ru/index-name-Content-op-view-id-41.html Первенец микробиологической промышленности] (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (''Kstovo, Russia's Young City'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirishi]] (1974).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the late 1970s, however, the cultural climate had completely changed, as the growth in SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, the [[price of oil]] rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had been two years earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

This was particularly vocal in Japan, where production came closest to fruition. For all their enthusiasm for innovation and traditional interest in microbiologically produced foods, the Japanese were the first to ban the production of single-cell proteins. The Japanese ultimately were unable to separate the idea of their new "natural" foods from the far from natural connotation of oil.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; These arguments were made against a background of suspicion of heavy industry in which anxiety over minute traces of [[petroleum]] was expressed. Thus, public resistance to an unnatural product led to the end of the SCP project as an attempt to solve world hunger.

Also, in 1989 in the USSR, the public environmental concerns made the government decide to close down (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had by that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, biotechnology offered another possible solution to a societal crisis. The escalation in the price of oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of [[gasohol]], gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

Biotechnology seemed to be the solution for major social problems, including world hunger and energy crises. In the 1960s, radical measures would be needed to meet world starvation, and biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. However, the solutions proved to be too expensive and socially unacceptable, and solving world hunger through SCP food was dismissed. In the 1970s, the food crisis was succeeded by the energy crisis, and here too, biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. But once again, costs proved prohibitive as oil prices slumped in the 1980s. Thus, in practice, the implications of biotechnology were not fully realized in these situations. But this would soon change with the rise of [[genetic engineering]].

==Genetic engineering==
The origins of biotechnology culminated with the birth of [[genetic engineering]]. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]], by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a [[recombinant DNA]] technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt; This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as "genetic engineering," it came to be defined as the basis of new biotechnology.

Genetic engineering proved to be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart at the center of the soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;  During the same month, [[Arthur Kornberg]] announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. "Life had been synthesized," said the head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as [[beta thalassemia]] and [[sickle-cell anemia]].

Responses to scientific achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, ''The Biological Time Bomb'', was written by the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; The book ended with a chapter called "The Future – If Any." While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of "[[Star Trek]]", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. "[[Cloning]]" became a popular word in the media. [[Woody Allen]] satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', and cloning [[Adolf Hitler]] from surviving cells was the theme of the 1976 novel by [[Ira Levin]], ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

In response to these public concerns, scientists, industry, and governments increasingly linked the power of [[recombinant DNA]] to the immensely practical functions that biotechnology promised. One of the key scientific figures that attempted to highlight the promising aspects of genetic engineering was [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Stanford professor and [[Nobel laureate]]. While in the 1960s "genetic engineering" described eugenics and work involving the manipulation of the [[human genome]], Lederberg stressed research that would involve microbes instead.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg emphasized the importance of focusing on curing living people. Lederberg's 1963 paper, "Biological Future of Man" suggested that, while molecular biology might one day make it possible to change the human genotype, "what we have overlooked is [[euphenics]], the engineering of human development."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg constructed the word "euphenics" to emphasize changing the [[phenotype]] after conception rather than the [[genotype]] which would affect future generations.

With the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggesting that the consequences of this work were so potentially destructive that there should be a pause until its implications had been thought through.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]]. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines were established.

[[Joshua Lederberg]] was the leading exception in emphasizing, as he had for years, the potential benefits. At [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], in an atmosphere favoring control and regulation, he circulated a paper countering the pessimism and fears of misuses with the benefits conferred by successful use. He described "an early chance for a technology of untold importance for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine: the ready production of an unlimited variety of human [[proteins]]. Analogous applications may be foreseen in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for cheaply manufacturing essential nutrients, and in the improvement of [[microbes]] for the production of [[antibiotics]] and of special industrial chemicals."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In June 1976, the 16-month moratorium on research expired with the Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) publication of the NIH guidelines of good practice. They defined the risks of certain kinds of experiments and the appropriate physical conditions for their pursuit, as well as a list of things too dangerous to perform at all. Moreover, [[modified organisms]] were not to be tested outside the confines of a laboratory or allowed into the environment.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|Synthetic [[insulin]] crystals synthesized using [[recombinant DNA]] technology]]

Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic vision of [[genetic engineering]] would soon lead to the development of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of [[recombinant DNA]] research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. [[Insulin]], one of the smaller,  best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating [[type 1 diabetes]] for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic [[human insulin]], one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic "human" insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the new biotechnology. Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="Krimsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krimsky|first1=Sheldon|title=Biotechnics &amp; society: the rise of industrial genetics|date=1991|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780275938598|pages=18, &amp; 21|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-XbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=027593859X&amp;dq=027593859X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces [[human growth hormone]], by the [[University of California]], thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The radical shift in the connotation of "genetic engineering" from an emphasis on the inherited characteristics of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Biotechnology and industry==
[[File:South San Francisco gateway sign.jpg|thumb|right|A Genentech-sponsored sign declaring South San Francisco to be "The Birthplace of Biotechnology."]]
With ancestral roots in [[industrial microbiology]] that date back centuries, the new biotechnology industry grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support.&lt;ref name="Krimsky" /&gt;  Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade organizations such as the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).

The main focus of attention after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: [[human growth hormone]] and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, [[interferon]]. [[Cancer]] was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grace|first1=Eric S.|title=Biotechnology Unzipped:: Promises and Realities|date=2006|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309096218|pages=78 &amp; 155|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtOv07UmQgAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, a new company, [[Biogen]], had produced [[interferon]] through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon and the possibility of curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. Moreover, to the 1970s plight of cancer was added [[AIDS]] in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="Colwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rita R|first1=Colwell|title=Fulfilling the promise of biotechnology|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2002|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=215–228|doi=10.1016/S0734-9750(02)00011-3|pmid=14550029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): synthetic [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[alpha-interferon]], and [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

The 2007–2008 [[global financial crisis]] led to several changes in the way the biotechnology industry was financed and organized. First, it led to a decline in overall financial investment in the sector, globally; and second, in some countries like the UK it led to a shift from business strategies focused on going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to seeking a [[trade sale]] instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birch|first=Kean|date=2016-08-10|title=Rethinking Value in the Bio-economy|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=460–490|doi=10.1177/0162243916661633|pmid=28458406|pmc=5390941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, financial investment in the biotechnology industry started to improve again and by 2014 the global market capitalization reached $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic engineering also reached the agricultural front as well. There was tremendous progress since the market introduction of the genetically engineered [[Flavr Savr tomato]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;  Ernst and Young reported that in 1998, 30% of the U.S. soybean crop was expected to be from genetically engineered seeds. In 1998, about 30% of the US cotton and corn crops were also expected to be products of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

Genetic engineering in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From the perspective of its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became a normal part of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.

==Global trends==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
According to Burrill and Company, an industry investment bank, over $350 billion has been invested in biotech since the emergence of the industry, and global revenues rose from $23 billion in 2000 to more than $50 billion in 2005. The greatest growth has been in [[Latin America]] but all regions of the world have shown strong growth trends.  By 2007 and into 2008, though, a downturn in the fortunes of biotech emerged, at least in the United Kingdom, as the result of declining investment in the face of failure of biotech pipelines to deliver and a consequent downturn in return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Sue |date=2008-08-01 |title=Is the U.K. Biotech Industry on the Skids? |journal=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2546&amp;chid=0 |issn=1935-472X|accessdate =2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I'''ndochristian art''', or '''''arte indocristiano''''', is a type of Latin American art that combines European colonial influences with Indigenous artistic styles and traditions.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monks extensively converted indigenous peoples to Christianity, introducing them to European arts and aesthetics. The arts of this period reflect a fusion of European and indigenous religious beliefs, aesthetics, and artistic traditions.

The term Indochristian art was coined by [[Constantino Reyes-Valerio]], a scholar of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture and arts, in his book, ''Indochristian Art, Sculpture and Painting of 16th Century Mexico''. Reyes-Valerio's work focused on the painting and sculpture of churches and monasteries in [[New Spain]], but had broader implications for the analysis of art throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azulmaya.com/indocristiano/index.php|title=Arte Indocristiano: Pintura y Escultura en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|date=2000|website=www.azulmaya.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==

=== Coinage of term ''Indochristian Art'' ===
The term ''indochristian art'' was coined by Constantino Reyes-Valerio in his 1978 work, ''Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Escuela Nacional de Conservación, Restauración y Museografía "Prof. Manuel del Castillo Negrete", SEP, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' This work was followed by an analysis of indochristian mural painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El pintor de conventos: los murales del siglo XVI en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two books were re-published in combined form in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Reyes-Valerio defines indochristian art as art that is indigenous in its production but Christian in its themes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; using the term as a designation for artwork that blended symbolic elements of Christian and pre-Hispanic cultures. An expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture, Reyes-Valerio focuses his studies on art produced in monastic settings in New Spain, primarily examining sculptures and paintings that ornament monasteries and convents, and identifying iconographic connections to earlier indigenous works.

Reyes-Valerio's coinage of the term indochristian art was based on his 45 years of experience studying pre-Columbian and colonial monuments throughout Mexico.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosquillas Quiles|first=Hortensia|date=Spring 2008|title=Constantino Reyes-Valerio, Arte indocristiano, México, INAH (Obra diversa), 2000, 486 pp., epílogo, apéndice y bibliografía|url=|journal=BOLETÍN DE MONUMENTOS HISTÓRICOS|volume=12|pages=159–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tracing the indigenous influence on colonial art, Reyes-Valerio relies primarily on close analysis of artistic details and motifs, a process he calls “speaking to the art”, but supports this analysis with documentary sources such as the journals of Augustinian, Franciscan, and Dominican friars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reyes-Valerio not only discusses indigenous artistic production, but ties this art to the educational systems created by European monks. He argues that the use of traditional native religious imagery by Indian artists is a form of rebellion intended to keep their traditions alive. 

=== Criticisms of the term ===
Although the significance of Reyes-Valerio's contribution to the identification of indigenous iconography within colonial monastic art is widely recognized, a number of art historians have criticized the implications of the word "indochristian" as well as Reyes-Valerio's analysis of the cultural context in which the art was produced.

In the book, ''Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power,'' Stefanie Wickstrom argues against the use of the term "indochristian". Wickstrom claims that the term oversimplifies colonial monastic art and the intentions of the artists by categorizing each element as either Indian or Christian in symbolism, failing to account for the evolution of a mestizo art form as Christian symbolism made contact with new cultures and evolved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power|last=Wickstrom|first=Stefanie|last2=Young|first2=Philip D.|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Tucson|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have objected to Reyes-Valerio's discussion of colonization; in discussing the colonization of New Spain, Reyes-Valerio makes the controversial claim that the spiritual conquest of Europeans over indigenous people was more damaging than the armed conquest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further, in his descriptions of the interactions between monks and indigenous people, Reyes-Valerio focuses primarily on the psychological harm done to the indigenous people as they lost their ancestral religious beliefs, and tends to overlook the physical harm inflicted upon them by Christian leaders. 

=== Related discussion of Indigenous artistic influence ===
Throughout the twentieth century, there were a number of movements to re-evaluate the role of indigenous peoples in creation of Latin American national identities. In Mexico following the revolution, the [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenismo]] movement placed increased value on indigenous culture and historical significance. This shift was reflected in a shift in art historian’s attitudes towards indigenous art and aesthetics. These influences on colonial art had largely been overlooked up until this point.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Recognition of indigenous artistic influences varied widely, with art historians only gradually recognizing the existence of an indigenous influence on Mexican colonial art. In 1939, Agustin Velazquez Chavez described the art of New Spain as the product of a mixing of Indian and Spanish cultures in conflict, placing special significance on the “Mexican” nature of this entwining of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tres siglos de pintura colonial mexicana|last=Velázquez Chávez|first=Agustín|publisher=Editiorial Polis|year=1939|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the Churrigueresque art of Mexico, Miguel Toussaint used the term “mestizo,” recognizing the participation of Indigenous people in the art of colonial Mexico.

The term “Tequitqui” was created by Jose Moreno Villa to categorize artistic works with a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous elements. With this term, which in Nahuatl means “tributary,” Moreno Villa drew a comparison between the art of colonial Mexico and the [[Mudéjar]] art of Muslims in Spain during the Reconquista.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La escultura colonial mexicana|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1942|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tequitqui was the first term used specifically to identify art combining colonial and indigenous influences, however, Moreno Villa limited its application to works in which the indigenous artist represents atavistic religious symbols. In later works Moreno Villa elaborates on his interpretation of Mexican colonial art, stating that the indigenous contribution to the genre was limited to the non-Christian deities represented, while claiming that the artistic style of colonial artworks was not tied to indigenous artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lo Mexicano en las artes plasticas|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1948|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Indochristian Art ==
[[File:Malinalco Hallway.jpg|thumb|Murals at the mission church of San Salvador, Malinalco, Mexico use native flora and fauna and indigenous concepts of the afterlife to depict the Christian garden of paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frames for conversion: The assimilation of native motifs in the monastic decoration of New Spain (1540–1580)|last=Dominguez Torres|first=Monica|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2004|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although the term "indochristian art" was originally only used to describe Mexican monastic sculpture and murals, by definition, it applies to any art that is created by indigenous artists and contains Christian themes. It can be applied to a wide variety of artistic traditions from colonial Latin America. The term becomes increasingly difficult to apply to art in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, however, as it relies upon a clearly defined opposition between indigenous artist and Euro-Christian themes. The way that indochristian art is defined overlooks the entanglement of Native and European identities and the mixing of cultures that gradually developed throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Religious artworks from colonial Latin America often demonstrate indochristian influence in a variety of ways. Indochristian art often includes depictions of atavistic deities and religious symbols, hieroglyphs, figures with indigenous features and traditional indigenous dress, and native flora and fauna. In addition, it may use traditional artistic styles of representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Monastic Art ===
In the early years of colonization, art was primarily commissioned by the church. As Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries attempted to convert the native populations of the Americas, their techniques varied widely, but frequently involved threats of violence. Missionaries generally attempted to eliminate indigenous culture, converting native people not only to Christianity, but also to European social practices.

Much Latin American monastic art of the colonial period could be designated as indochristian. Murals, paintings, architectural designs, sculptures, and ornamental objects all were frequently created by native craftspeople and incorporated indigenous iconography.

=== Cuzco School ===
The [[Cuzco School]] was an artistic tradition associated with Cusco, Peru. Following the Spanish conquest of the Incan empire, a group of Spanish religious artists were sent to Cusco to aid in the conversion of Inca people to Catholicism. This group of artists began a school, teaching Quechua and mestizo people to draw and use oil paints according to European styles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sor María Juana de Señor San Rafael y Martínez.jpg|thumb|An example of a crowned nun, combining traditional Mesoamerican flower art with Christian iconography]]Based on pre-columbian artistic traditions, Cusqueño painters created artworks anonymously and included native flora and fauna in their works. They also created a tradition of painting Inca monarchs – a departure from Christian religious themes and an expression of cultural pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America|last=Bethell|first=Leslie|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ángel Arcabucero (Arquebusier Angel) ===
[[Ángel arcabucero]] is a genre of painting tied to the Cuzco school. These paintings depict angels holding an arquebus, or early firearm, and dressed in clothing reminiscent of that worn by Andean nobility. These angels are believed to be connected to pre-Hispanic winged warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ángeles apócrifos en la América virreinal|last=Mujica Pinilla|first=Ramon|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1992|isbn=|location=Lima|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monja Coronada (Crowned Nun) ===
Monja Coronada (Crowned nun) is a genre of portrait paintings common among Mexican convents. These commemorative portraits of nuns wearing bridal clothes and floral crowns were common in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virreinato.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=88|title=Monjas Coronadas. Vida conventual femenina|last=|first=|date=|website=Museo Nacional de Virreinato|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a Euro-Christian perspective, the nuns' bridal trappings allude to the Virgin Mary crowned, symbolizing mystical marriage to God and victory over sin. This Christian symbolism is, however, combined with Mesoamerican imagery; the paintings frequently replace the traditional European palm frond with a Mesoamerican flower staff, and ornament the crown with flowers according to traditional flower art practices. In addition, the bird and butterfly imagery that is frequently included in crowned nun portraits may symbolize indigenous beliefs regarding the soul and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordova|first=James M.|date=2011-12-01|title=Clad in Flowers: Indigenous Arts and Knowledge in Colonial Mexican Convents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=93|issue=4|pages=449–467|doi=10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|issn=0004-3079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main activities ==

Institute for Environmental Solutions (IES) will implement two [[satellite]] [[simulation]] projects as part of the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency’s]] (ESA) programme „The Plan for European Co-operating States”.&lt;ref name="PECS"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Plan_for_European_Cooperating_States/General_overview2 The Plan for European Cooperating States (PECS) web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The first project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-2|Sentinel – 2]] satellite for the improvement of [[land cover/land use]] monitoring while the second project proposes to simulate the [[Sentinel-3|Sentinel – 3]] satellite for the analysis of optically complex coastal waters such as the [[Baltic Sea]].

IES has been assessing the [[ecology]] of the [[Baltic Sea]] since 2010. As a part of the MARMONI project,&lt;ref name="MARMONI"&gt;[http://marmoni.balticseaportal.net/wp/ MARMONI project web site]. Project title: Innovative approaches for marine biodiversity monitoring and assessment of conservation status of nature values in the Baltic Sea (Acronym - MARMONI).&lt;/ref&gt; the institute researched the [[chlorophyll]] concentration in the [[Gulf of Riga]] and Swedish coastline. The airborne remote sensing has been tested and proven its usefulness in [[HELCOM]] Balex Delta&lt;ref name="Balex Delta"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/action-areas/response-to-spills/helcom-balex-delta-and-other-exercises/ International training of marine monitoring HELCOM Balex Delta.]&lt;/ref&gt; and CEPCO North&lt;ref name="Cepco North"&gt;[http://helcom.fi/news/Pages/Regular-aerial-surveillance-reduces-illegal-discharges-in-the-Baltic-Sea.aspx International training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea CEPCO North.]&lt;/ref&gt; international training towards detecting pollution in the Baltic Sea.

IES has built its expertise in the lake fish [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] by cooperating with the world leading experts in the area, such as the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] and [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE); IES has been responsible for Latvia’s first-ever holistic [[lake ecosystem]] and status surveying in [[Lake Burtnieks]]; [[Lake Alūksne]]; Lake Sāviena; [[Āraiši lake dwelling site|Lake Āraiši]]. The holistic approach involves the analysis of [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], [[zoobenthos]], [[freshwater biology]], status of fish population, as well as the measurement and assessment of lake overgrowth, lake depth and [[sediment]]s through the use of [[ground-penetrating radar]]&lt;ref name="GPR"&gt;[http://www.videsinstituts.lv/en/flying-laboratory/ground-penetrating-radar-gpr Description of IES's Ground Penetrating Radar]&lt;/ref&gt; and modelling the [[nutrient cycle]] in the lake ecosystem.

Since 2012 IES has been helping the [http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/projects/est_lat_rus1/nca/ Nature Conservation Agency] to fight illegal fishing. By using [[Thermographic camera|thermal]] airborne remote sensing IES is able to identify [[illegal fishing]] activities near public lakes, rivers and coastal areas in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Geograpfy of Lavia"&gt;[[Geography of Latvia|Geography and geographic features of Latvia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

IES has been testing and adapting an innovative airborne remote sensing approach for the mapping and status assessment of protected [[habitat]]s of EU importance&lt;ref name="Habitat Directive"/&gt; within and beyond the specially protected nature territories in Latvia.&lt;ref name="Protected territories"&gt;[http://www.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/protected_areas/ Specially protected territories in Latvia]&lt;/ref&gt; IES is mapping such habitats as coastal and inland [[dune]]s, [[moorland]], [[scrubland]], [[grassland]], [[wetland]] and [[forest]] [[habitat]]s.

By cooperating with [http://www.befgroup.net/ Baltic Environmental Forum] and as a part of two international projects Grass Service&lt;ref name="Grass Service"&gt;[http://grassservice.balticgrasslands.eu/en/ Grass Service project web site]. Project title: Alternative use of biomass for maintenance of grassland biodiversity and ecosystem service (Acronym – Grass Service)&lt;/ref&gt; and Viva Grass&lt;ref name="Viva Grass"&gt;[http://vivagrass.eu/ Viva Grass project web site]. Project title: Integrated planning tool to ensure viability of grasslands (Acronym - Viva Grass)&lt;/ref&gt; IES has carried out the mapping and status assessment of High Nature Value [[grassland]]s.&lt;ref name="Grassland habitats"&gt;[http://nat-programme.daba.gov.lv/public/eng/habitats/grasslands/ Grassland habitats in Latvia]. National Conservation and Management Programme for Natura 2000 sites in Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2013 cooperating with [[Riga Technical University]], IES developed new solutions for mapping the distribution and calculation of [[biomass]] of the Giant Hogweed (''[[Heracleum sosnowskyi]]''). The mapping helped to calculate the potential use of environmental waste (such as hogweed) for the 2nd generation [[Bio fuel|biofuel]] – [[Butanol fuel|biobutanol]] production.

'''Jeffrey Burke Satinover''' (September 4, 1947) is an American [[psychiatrist]], [[psychoanalyst]], and [[physicist]]. He is known for books on a number of controversial topics in physics and neuroscience, and on religion, but especially for his writing and public-policy efforts relating to [[homosexuality]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[ex-gay movement]].

==Biography==
Satinover was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 4, 1947, to Joseph and Sena Satinover. He lived in and around Chicago until moving to California at the beginning of his high school years. Satinover won a National Merit Scholarship. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1971. He obtained a [[Ed.M.|Master of Education degree]] in Clinical Psychology and Public Practice from [[Harvard University]], a medical degree at the [[University of Texas]], and a [[Master of Science]] in Physics at [[Yale University]]. He received a diploma in analytical psychology from the C. G. Jung Institute of Zürich, becoming their youngest graduate. He trained there and became an accredited Jungian analyst.&lt;ref name=leff&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/style/psychotherapist-weds-julie-leff.html "Psychotherapist Weds Julie Leff," June 11, 1982], accessed March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He received a PhD in physics in the laboratory of [[Didier Sornette]] at the University of Nice in France, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.er.ethz.ch/publications/thesis |title=ETH - Entrepreneurial Risks - Publications |publisher=Er.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satinover served in the 1/169th combat-support helicopter battalion of the [[Connecticut Army National Guard]] as a flight surgeon and was also an Army Reserve Psychiatrist with the rank of major.

In 1974, Satinover was the youngest person ever to deliver the [[William James Lectures]] in Psychology and Religion at [[Harvard University]].

He practiced clinical psychiatry between 1986 and 2003 and psychoanalysis between 1976 and 2003.

He was President of the C.G. Jung Foundation of New York.{{When|date=March 2012}}

He has taught Constitutional Law and Civil Liberties in the Department of Politics at [[Princeton University]].{{When|date=March 2012}}

He was a fellow (resident) in psychiatry and child psychiatry at Yale, where he was twice awarded the department of psychiatry's Seymour Lustman Residency Research Prize (2nd place).{{When|date=March 2012}}

He married for the second time in 1982, having previously divorced and is the father of three daughters.&lt;ref name=leff /&gt;
According to two journalists,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, ''Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1994), 306-09.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1991, during the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], Satinover suggested during dinner conversation with President Bush's nephew&lt;ref&gt;Timothy M. Phelps and Helen Winternitz, ''Capitol Games'', Hyperion (1992) p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Anita Hill]], if suffering from [[erotomania]] (a "[[delusional disorder]]"), might be entirely convinced that Thomas had sexually harassed her, even if he had not, just as a witness for Thomas, [[John Doggett (columnist)|John Doggett]], (now a conservative commentator) claimed had happened with him. She would even pass a lie detector test, as Hill had, convinced of the truth of what she was saying. Soon Satinover and another psychiatrist, [[Park Dietz]] were explaining this possibility to Thomas' Senate sponsor, [[John Danforth]], and White House press secretary, Larry Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Peyton Thomas, ''Clarence Thomas: a biography''. Encounter Books (2001) pp. 442-448&lt;/ref&gt; though as psychiatrists neither would testify about a patient they had not examined. (Psychiatrists brought in by the Democrats similarly refused to testify.&lt;ref&gt;Herb Kutchin and Stuart Kirk, ''Making Us Crazy'', Simon and Schuster (2003), pp. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; Satinover was quoted as stating that once he saw the testimony of one of Hill's main critics, [[John Doggett]], he concluded the idea was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thomas Nomination; Parade of Witnesses Support Hill's Story, Thomas' Integrity|author=Adam Clymer|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 1991|accessdate=March 28, 2012|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/14/us/thomas-nomination-parade-witnesses-support-hill-s-story-thomas-s-integrity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A founder of Connecticut's Committee to Save Our Schools (CT:SOS), Satinover was active in the mid-1990s, supporting the resistance to "Outcomes-Based Education" and other related educational initiatives. Under his co-leadership, CT:SOS defeated a proposal in the Connecticut legislature to replace locally elected school boards with a single state-appointed board, a proposal supported by a broad-based coalition of government, educational unions and corporations, particularly Union Carbide. Connecticut did not adopt the CT:SOS program of alternative, traditionalist reforms co-authored by Satinover, "Academic-Based Education", but the Board of Education of San Diego, California, then the nation's sixth largest public school system, did so.

He has provided commentary for two documentary films, ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know?!|What the #$*! Do We (K)now!?]]'' (2004) and ''What the Bleep!?: Down the Rabbit Hole '' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1688748/ Jeffrey Satinover ], accessed March 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he completed a Ph.D. ''summa cum laude'' in Physics at the [[University of Nice]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkc.edu/media/archives2.asp?id=123 |title=TKC: Provost Marvin Olasky announces faculty appointments |publisher=Tkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233404/http://www.tkc.edu/media/archives2.asp?id=123 |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satinover was Distinguished Visiting Professor of Math and Science at [[The King's College (New York)|King's College]], New York City, a private Christian college affiliated with [[Campus Crusade for Christ]]. He also teaches at the [[C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich]]. He is a visiting scientist at the Department of Management, Technology and Economics of the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Social Science Research Network: [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1430859 Jeffrey Satinover], accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He is Managing Director of Quintium Analytics, LLC, a proprietary investment advisory company he founded in 2007. Satinover is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narth.com/menus/advisors.html |title=NARTH Scientific Advisory Committee |publisher=Narth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He conducts research in complex and agent-based systems theory ([[econophysics]], the [[El Farol Bar problem#Minority game|minority game]]). His former areas of physics research were in fundamental quantum theory and in its application to quantum information processing and computation. Presently he is investigating certain aspects of game theory in complex systems.

Satinover is Jewish, but says he has an eclectic worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virtueonline.org/jewish-psychiatrist-influenced-cs-lewis-says-gays-can-change|title=Jewish Psychiatrist, Influenced by CS Lewis, says gays can change|last=Virtue|first=David|date=2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/02/28/1653911/ex-gay-advocates-claim-homosexuality-is-caused-by-parental-abuse/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and research==
Satinover's book, ''Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth'' (1996), published by the [[evangelical Christian]] publisher [[Baker Books]], debates the nature of homosexuality from psychological, religious and scientific perspectives, discussing homosexuality primarily in the context of being a condition that can or should be treated, contrary to the views of the mainstream psychiatric and psychological community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satinover draws comparisons between homosexuality and various pathologies (''e.g.,'' alcoholism, pedophilia) and argues that homosexuality involves compulsive impulses. He states that homosexuality "is not a true illness, though it may be thought an illness in the spiritual sense of 'soul sickness,' innate to fallen human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlafJCzJWP4C&amp;pg=PT340&amp;lpg=PT340&amp;dq=satinover+soul+sickness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EuONsL-r6n&amp;sig=AnP04inKGcuKqo1d652tlSUioOI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GkqIT7jCFpOK8QS75eztCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=soul%20sickness&amp;f=false |title=Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth - Jeffrey Satinover - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that "gay activism distorts the truth and harms not only society, but homosexuals themselves". Most of the book discusses [[whether homosexuality is biological]] and genetic and if it can be changed. About one fifth of the book discusses human sexuality from Jewish and Christian perspectives. In the book's introduction, Satinover states that "[i]n the end the debate over homosexual behavior and its implications for public policy can only be decided conclusively on moral grounds, and moral grounds will ultimately mean religious grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlafJCzJWP4C&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=satinover%20homosexuality%20decided%20on%20moral&amp;pg=PT36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth - Jeffrey Satinover - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Satinover was called by the State of Florida as an expert witness in Amer v. Johnson, which challenged Florida's law prohibiting adoption by gays and lesbians. "Surprisingly, Satinover said in his testimony that 'if two homosexuals wanted to adopt a child, I would have no objection to it if one of them was a man and one of them was a woman' [but]  'the 'needs' of a child includes having [both] a mother and a father'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onenewsnow.com/Perspectives/Default.aspx?id=140120 |title=Perspectives |publisher=Onenewsnow.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726065457/http://www.onenewsnow.com/Perspectives/Default.aspx?id=140120 |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plocher |first=Carolyn |url=http://www.mrc.org/node/29164 |title=Newsweek Column: 'Same-sex Marriage is an American Value' &amp;#124; Media Research Center |publisher=Mrc.org |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "The state of Florida wanted me to argue that the reason the ban should be upheld was because homosexuals made bad parents and I refused to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0090.html |title=Gay Marriage: Who’s Minding the Children? |publisher=Catholiceducation.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After several years of additional court cases relating to the Florida's anti-gay adoption ban, ''[[In re: Gill]]'' resulted in the ban being declared unconstitutional in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/26florida.html?_r=1 |title=Florida Gay Adoption Ban Is Rules Unconstitutional |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satinover has frequently testified regarding his views on [[same sex marriage]]. In a hearing before the Massachusetts Judicial Committee in April 2003, he testified that homosexuality is not immutable and that the [[Environment and sexual orientation|environment]] plays an important role in [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;NARTH: [http://narth.com/docs/senatecommittee.html "Dr. Jeffrey Satinover Testifies Before Massachusetts Senate Committee Studying Gay Marriage," April 28, 2003], accessed March 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations that oppose the expansion of [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights and protections]] have frequently cited his research in their position papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalvalues.org/content/hatecrimes909 |title=The So-Called ‘Hate Crimes’ Bill S. 909, The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Pre - Traditional Values Coalition |publisher=Traditionalvalues.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF10G25.pdf |title=The Defense of Marriage Act |publisher=Downloads.frc.org |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defendthefamily.com/_docs/resources/6390601.pdf |title=Crafting "Gay" Children |publisher=Defendthefamily.com |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen/09b/Redeeming_rainbow/Redeeming%20the%20Rainbow%20smaller%20file%20for%20e-mail.pdf |title=Redeeming The Rainbow |publisher=Massresistance.org |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansfortruth.com/issues/the-agenda-glbtq-activist-groups/national-glbtq-activist-groups/apa/ |title=APA |publisher=Americans for Truth |date=2006-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Values Coalition: [http://www.traditionalvalues.org/content/hatecrimes909 "The So-Called 'Hate Crimes' Bill S. 909, The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act," June 25, 2009], accessed March 28, 2012; MassResistance: [http://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen/09b/Redeeming_rainbow/Redeeming%20the%20Rainbow%20smaller%20file%20for%20e-mail.pdf Scott Lively, "Redeemingthe Rainbow," 2009], accessed March 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Satinover's other writings include ''Cracking the Bible Code'', about information purportedly encrypted as a [[Bible code]] into the first five books in the [[Hebrew Bible]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  
He is the author of articles, chapters, and books on topics ranging from brain [[neurophysiology]] to the psychology of [[narcissism]] to the breakdown of modern society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} His book ''The Quantum Brain'' explores current developments at the interface of physics, computation, [[artificial intelligence]] and neuroscience. It is written for a well-educated, general readership, but it has been cited in a number of scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;Goethe Universität: [http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/7468 Peter Jedlicka, "Quantum stochasticity and neuronal computations," January 27, 2010], accessed March 28, 2012; ''[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]'': [http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~mboyle/COGS11-Summer/COGS11-website/pdf-files/neuroethics-reductionism-dualism-TICS-editorial.pdf Peter Jedlička, "Neuroethics, reductionism and dualism," April 2005], accessed March 28, 2012; Quantum aspects of low-temperature properties of crystals: A calorimetric study in interaction with spectroscopy and diffraction [PDF] from iupac.org, T Matsuo - Pure Appl.

Satinover's current scientific research, with [[Didier Sornette]] of the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]], centers on studies of game theory and in particular the minority game, attending to the "illusion of control" in these games.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Image:Island nations.svg|thumb|350px|Sovereign states and states with limited recognition fully on islands (Australia is regarded a continent), those with land borders shaded green, and those without shaded dark blue]]

This is a '''list of island countries'''. An [[island]] is a land mass (smaller than a [[continent]]) that is surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/island| title=Definition of island| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[island country|island countries]] are spread over an [[archipelago]], as is the case with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Indonesia]] (both of which consist of thousands of islands). Others consist of a single island, such as [[Nauru]], or part of an island, such as [[Haiti]]. Although [[Australia]] is designated as [[Australia (continent)|a continent]], it is often referred to as an island, as it  has no land [[border]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |authorlink= |author2=A.J. Rose, Anneliese Löffler &amp; Denis Warner |title=Australia:Portrait of a Continent |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson Group |location=[[Richmond, Victoria]] |page=17 |isbn=0-09-130460-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some declared island countries are not universally recognized as politically independent, such as [[Northern Cyprus]]. Some states, such as [[Taiwan]], officially claim to hold continental territories but are ''de facto'' limited to control over islands.

The '''logic of information''', or the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  In this line of work, the concept of information serves to integrate the aspects of signs and expressions that are separately covered, on the one hand, by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], and on the other hand, by the concepts of [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]].

Peirce began to develop these ideas in his lectures "On the Logic of Science" at [[Harvard University]] (1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (1866).

F.|title=Perspectives on culture, technology, and communication: The media ecology tradition|year=2006|publisher=NJ: Hampton|location=Gencarelli|pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecology]] in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Understanding Me:  Lectures and Interviews,'' by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe.  MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

''''Miller v. Skumanick'''' was a 2010 [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] case regarding the practice of [[sexting]] and its legal relationship to [[child pornography]].

==Background==
In October 2008, [[Tunkhannock Area School District]] officials confiscated several students' cellphones and found photographs of three female students, two were in their underwear and one was topless. No photos were exposed below the waist and no sexual acts were portrayed. He gave those photos as to [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming County]] District Attorney George Skumanick, Jr.  Skumanick promised to file charges against those posing in the photographs for production of child pornography unless they agreed to probation, completed a six to nine month educational program which would require participants to submit an essay explaining why their actions were wrong.  No actions were proposed against the male students possessing and distributing the images. The three families collectively filed for a [[Injunction#Temporary restraining orders|temporary restraining order]] in [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania|district court]] to prevent the prosecution from taking place while they seek an injunction.  The restraining order was granted, and Skumanick appealed.

==Decision==
The plaintiffs argued that prosecution would amount to retaliation against their children's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression and against compelled speech, and the parents' [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] substantive due process right to direct the upbringing of their children.  The appellate court upheld the temporary restraining order based on the second and third claims.  Specifically, the court affirmed that the students' First Amendment right against compelled speech would be violated by the program's requirement that the student involve explain why their actions were wrong, and the parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated by the program's moral nature.

The appellate court opinion in this matter did not address whether the pictures in question were pornographic in nature, as it instead ruled that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs ever possessed or distributed the photos.

{{Sexual orientation}}
[[Sexual orientation]] is an enduring pattern of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]],&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Heterosexuality, Homosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --&gt; the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsychiAssn-Sexual orientation"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|accessdate=January 1, 2013|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archivedate=July 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080052/http://www.healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in [[neuroscience]] explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.

== Developmental neurobiology ==
Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.03.002 |title=The neurodevelopment of human sexual orientation |year=2005 |last1=Rahman |first1=Q |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=29 |pages=1057–66 |pmid=16143171 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, [[sexual dimorphisms]] in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal [[androgens]] as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality.&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt;  This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including [[Digit ratio|2D:4D finger ratios]], [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|auditory evoked potentials]], fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt;

Other evidence supporting the role of [[testosterone]] and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with [[cloacal exstrophy]] who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swaab DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research directions ==
As of 2005, research directions included:&lt;ref name=number6 /&gt; 
* finding markers for sex steroid levels in the brains of fetuses that highlight features of early neuro-development leading to certain sexual orientations
* determine the precise neural circuitry underlying direction of sexual preference
* use animal models to explore genetic and developmental factors that influence sexual orientation
* further population studies, genetic studies, and serological markers to clarify and definitively determine the effect of maternal immunity
* neuroimaging studies to quantify sexual-orientation-related differences in structure and function in vivo
* neurochemical studies to investigate the roles of sex steroids upon neural circuitry involved in sexual attraction

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12652">'''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''' are a set of internationally accepted specifications for the testing of chemicals decided on by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).  They were first published in 1981. They are split into five sections:

* Section 1: Physical Chemical Properties
* Section 2: Effects on Biotic Systems
* Section 3: Degradation and Accumulation
* Section 4: Health Effects
* Section 5: Other Test Guidelines

Guidelines are numbered with three digit numbers, the section number being the first number.  Sometimes guidelines are suffixed with a letter.

Guidelines are under constant review, with guidelines being periodically updated, new guidelines being adopted, and guidelines being withdrawn.  Previous guidelines are maintained on the website for reference purposes.  [[Animal welfare]] concerns are dealt with by ensuring that animal tests are only permitted where necessary.

The guidelines are available in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

'''Petros Vassiliadis''' (born 1945) is a Greek [[biblical scholar]] and [[Professor Emeritus]] of the Department of Theology of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] (AUTh), president of the Center of Ecumenical, Missiological and Environmental Studies “Metropolitan Panteleimon Papageorgiou” (CEMES) and the World Conference of Associations and Theological Institutions and Educators (WOCATI). He was born in [[Thessaloniki]] in 1945, pursued undergraduate studies in Theology and Mathematics in AUTh, and post-graduate studies in [[Biblical Criticism]] and [[Biblical Theology]] at British ([[King's College London]]) and German ([[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]) universities.

==Studies and career==
Petros Vassiliadis started his academic career by serving as an assistant to the late professor Savvas Agouridis (1974-1977) at the Theological School of the [[University of Athens]], where he submitted his doctoral dissertation entitled ''On the Hypothesis of the Q-Document. A Critical Consideration of Current Literary and Theological Problems of the Q-Document'' (1977).

He then moved to his home town, [[Thessaloniki]], where he was elected lecturer in 1982, assistant professor in 1983, associate professor in 1985, and full professor in 1989, at the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There he taught for almost 35 years New Testament and [[Interfaith dialogue]], being also assigned for some time the courses of Missiology, Liturgics and Ecumenical Dialogue. He also taught as a visiting professor at various institutions, universities and colleges of USA (St. Vladimir's, St. Athanasius, Smith College, Lynchburg),  of  Europe  (Bossey,  Bologna Bari, Ravenna, Copenhagen, Lund, Oslo, Joensuu, Reykiavik), and Asia (South Korea).

He was for many years the departmental coordinator of the Erasmus/Socrates program of inter-university cooperation of the [[European Union]]. From 1986 he is co-editor of the Greek biblical series “Hermeneia of the New Testament” (ΕΚΔ) and “Bibliotheca Biblica” (ΒΒ), editor of the ecumenical series “Ecclesia-Koinonia-Oecumene” (ΕΚΟ), and of the CEMES series, editor-in-chief for East and South Europe of the “International Studies in Formative Christianity and Judaism” of the University of South Florida, and editor of the ''Great Orthodox Christian Encyclopedia'' (Μεγάλη Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Εγκυκλοπαίδεια, MOXE) in its early stages.

He also served as an Orthodox commissioner of CWME of the WCC (1998-2006), and chief organizer of the 14th World Mission Conference, officially hosted on his recommendation by the [[Church of Greece]] in Athens (2005), for the first time in an Orthodox  setting. He was coordinator of the Biblical Studies  in the 12th World Mission Conference in San Antonio, Texas of USA (1989), and the 8th General Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe (1998). In addition, he served in various Synodical Committees of the Church of Greece (of Liturgical Renewal, and of Inter-Orthodox and Inter-Christian Relations), consultant of the [[United Bible Societies]] for the improvement of the relations with the Orthodox Churches and the presentation of the Orthodox understanding of the Bible to the global family of the Bible Societies, institutional coordinator of the Forum Mediterraneum, dealing with issues pertinent to faith,  history  of religions, and  cultural anthropological research on the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean sea, and member of the editorial committee of the Orthodox biblical journal ''Δελτίο Βιβλικών Μελετών'' (Bulletin of Biblical Studies) of the “[http://www.artoszois.gr/ Artos Zoes]” foundation, and of the Regnum Edinburgh 2010 Mission Series of the Oxford Center of Mission Studies.

He is Honorary President of the WOCATI, a founding member, secretary, and vice-president of the Society for Ecumenical Studies and Inter-Orthodox Relations (SESIOR), founding member, first secretary, and now president of the CEMES, member of the Q International Project of the Society of Biblical Literature, as well as of the ''[[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]]'' (SNTS), and among the coordinators of the regular conferences of Eastern and Western N.T. Scholars. He was one of the main contributors of the Inter-Christian Symposia of the Department of Theology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the [[Pontifical University Antonianum]] of Rome, and a close friend of the ecumenical monastic community of Bose in Italy.

He was awarded with the highest honour of the municipality of [[Neapoli, Thessaloniki|Neapoli]], Thessaloniki, for his contribution to the religious and cultural development of his home town, and also from the municipality of [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] for his overall scientific contribution. Together with his colleagues, professors S. Agouridis, G. Galitis, J. Karavidopoulos, B. Stoyannos and J. Galanis, he translated [[Bible translations into Greek|the New Testament into Modern Greek]] (1977-1989). He published, edited in Greek and English nearly 20 books, and 300 articles in scientific journals, conference proceedings, and collective volumes, as well as in the conventional and electronic press. He supervised more than 17 master and 10 doctoral dissertations (promoting, in addition to the traditional, the sociological, feminist and other contemporary exegetical methods of biblical analysis), but also of missiological, ecumenical and liturgical character. He also participated in radio and television discussions, and gave numerous interviews on a variety of themes. He participated in more than 100 international conferences.

==His contribution to the Biblical studies==
In the field of biblical literature his scholarly speciality was mainly the Sayings of the Historical Jesus, the Q-Document,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his doctoral dissertation, ''Η περί της Πηγής των Λογίων θεωρία'', Αθήνα 1977; ''LOGOI IESOU. Studies in Q'', Atlanta 1999; ''Τα Λόγια του Ιησού. Το αρχαιότερο ευαγγέλιο'', Athens 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; the  Pauline theology,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Σταυρός και Σωτηρία'', Thessaloniki 1983; ''Χάρις- Κοινωνία-Διακονία. Ο κοινωνικός χαρακτήρας του παύλειου προγράμματος της λογείας'', Thessaloniki 1985; ''Παύλος: Τομές στη θεολογία του Α΄'', Thessaloniki 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theology of Liturgy and [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Βιβλικές Ερμηνευτικές Μελέτες'', Thessaloniki 1987; Επίκαιρα Αγιογραφικά Θέματα. Αγία Γραφή και Ευχαριστία, Thessaloniki 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ηis contribution to the Synoptic (Q) scholarship was mainly his widely accepted and used procedural principles for the reconstruction of the Q-Document&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Nature and Extent of the Q-Document", ''Novum Testamentum'' 20 (1978) 49-73.&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequences of the [[Q source|Q Hypothesis]], not so much as a solution to the Synoptic Problem, but as a change of the conventional picture of Christian origins. With regard to the Pauline collection project, on the basis of a thorough examination of 2 Corinthians 8-9, he is among those specialized scholars who support the social character of this ancient radical institution of Christianity, the main purpose of which was the ideal of “equal distribution and permanent sharing of the material wealth.” As to the Pauline (and general New Testament) Theology his recommendation is a combination of historical and thematic approach of this discipline, with a parallel recognition and use of such semi- and extra-canonical texts and traditions, as [[Q source|Q]] and the [[Gospel of Thomas]] among others, suggesting what he calls a “Eucharistic Paradigm”.

==His theological contribution==
Although his primary scholarly profession is biblical, he has deliberately chosen to engage with the wider theological scholarship. With the decline of the word of God, the Gospel and the overall biblical foundation of the Orthodox theology, mainly as a result of the predominance of the institutional expression of the Church at the expense of her charismatic character, he attempted in many of his works a creative encounter between the later development of the ecclesiastical tradition and the modern theological problematic with the foundational biblical tradition. Realizing the fragmentation of contemporary theological scholarship, and wishing to overcome it, he extended his scholarly and practical engagement to other areas, such as ecumenical movement and theology, missiology, liturgical theology, and world theological education.

Among his characteristic theological propositions is the priority of the eschatological experience of the early Christian community over against its literary products (texts, Bible etc.), although from the time of St. Paul there has been a shift of the center of gravity from the (Eucharistic) experience to the (Christian) message, from eschatology to Christology (and further and consequently to soteriology), from the event (the Kingdom of God), to the bearer and center of this event (Christ, and more precisely his sacrifice on the cross). This basic theological positions of his, i.e. the priority of the horizontal (ecclesiological and eschatological) perspective, both in the N.T. and in the early Church, as well as in later Christian literature, with the vertical soteriological (Pauline?) teaching placed always within the framework of the horizontal eschatological as complementary, has determined his extra-biblical theological activity and research.

Basing his theological endeavour on the foundational, yet marginalized, incarnational Christian doctrine, and maintaining the overcoming the traditional patristic “exclusivity” of modern Orthodox theology, and in addition promoting the necessity of the biblical foundation of the Eucharistic ecclesiology, he adamantly promotes – following the legacy of his Doctor Vater, the late Savvas Agouridis – the Prophetic theology, above and beyond the contemporary classical “theologies”, which dominated his country since the decade of the ‘60s, i.e. the Eucharistic and the therapeutic.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “[https://www.academia.edu/5016830/%CE%95%CE%99%CE%A3_%CE%9C%CE%95%CE%A4%CE%A1%CE%9F%CE%9D_%CE%97%CE%9B%CE%99%CE%9A%CE%99%CE%91%CE%A3_%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%A0%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%A1%CE%A9%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A3_%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%A7%CE%A1%CE%99%CE%A3%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%95%CE%A6_4_17_._To_%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C_%CF%85%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%B2%CE%B1%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF_%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82_%CF%87%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82_%CF%80%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%82 ‘Εις μέτρον ηλικίας του πληρώματος του Χριστού’ (Εφ 4:17). To βιβλικό υπόβαθρο της χριστιανικής πνευματικότητας],” and “[https://www.academia.edu/7652645/%CE%A0%CF%84%CF%85%CF%87%CE%AD%CF%82_%CF%83%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%87%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82_%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%84%CF%85%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85._%CE%A4%CE%BF_%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BF_%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%85%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF_%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C_%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%B1_ Πτυχές σύγχρονης μαρτυρίας του ευαγγελίου: Το νέο αναδυόμενο βιβλικό ‘παράδειγμα’],” ''Θεολογία'' 58:2 (2014) 63-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In quite a number of his works he opined that the relegation of the biblical word has inevitably resulted in limiting contemporary theology in dilemmas of the type: therapeutic or Eucharistic theology, gerontes/starets or bishop, theosis or sacraments etc. Following the general line of Metropolitan of Pergamon, John (Zizioulas’) Eucharistic  ecclesiology  for  the  necessity  of  the  “primacy”  on  a theological and not just historical basis, he also brought into the fore for reconsideration the views expressed by the pioneer in the field [[Nicholas Afanasiev]],&lt;ref&gt;«Συνοδικότητα και πρωτείο στην Καινή Διαθήκη. Η παύλεια ‘περιεκτική’ ευχαριστιακή  θεολογία  αίτιο  και  προϋπόθεση  της  συνοδικότητας», ''Θεολογία'' 80 (2009) vol. 2, 43-66)&lt;/ref&gt; underlining Pneumatological (in addition to the Christological) and the Missiological (beyond the Eucharistic) dimension of the Church, thus coming closer to the theological views supported by the [[Anastasios of Albania|Archbishop Anastasios (Yannoulatos) of Tirana, Durrës and All Albania]].

==His missiological contribution==
Based on this position and relying on the biblical data he suggested a reconsideration of the Orthodox position on ''intercommunio'' and of the exclusivistic character of the Eucharist,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. «Η Ευχαριστία ως στοιχείο περιεκτικότητας και ενότητας στην εκκλησιολογία της Καινής Διαθήκης», ''ΔΒΜ'' 24 (2006) 77-105; “The Missionary Implications  of  St. Paul’s  Eucharistic  Inclusiveness,” ''The  Relevance  of  Rev.  Ion Bria’s Work for Contemporary Society and the Life of the Church'', Sibiu 2010, 123-128; and “St. Paul: Apostle of Freedom in Christ,” ''In the Footsteps of Saint Paul. An Academic Symposium'', HC Orthodox Press Boston 2011, 153-167)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of the Orthodox position on [[Christian anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. «Ο ιερός Αυγουστίνος ως ερμηνευτής του αποστόλου Παύλου και το πρόβλημα της ανθρώπινης σεξουαλικότητας», ''Θεολογία'' 81 (2010) vol. 3, 129-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-80s he promotes a new “paradigm” of Christian witness (mission) in the  post-modern  era,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his  studies ''Η  Ορθοδοξία  στο  Σταυροδρόμι'', Thessaloniki 1992; ''Μετανεωτερικότητα και Εκκλησία. Η πρόκληση της Ορθοδοξίας'', Athens 2002; ''Ενότητα και Μαρτυρία: Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Μαρτυρία και Διαθρησκειακός Διάλογος-Εγχειρίδιο Ιεραποστολής'', Thessaloniki 2007; and he edited ''Orthodox Perspectives on Mission'', Regnum, Oxford 2013, and ''Ορθόδοξη προσέγγιση για μια θεολογία των θρησκειών'', CEMES, Thessaloniki 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; being at the same time systematically engaged with the Orthodox understanding of the ecumenical theology,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “Η Ορθόδοξη Εκκλησία και η αναζήτηση της ορατής ενότητος”, ''Ορθοδοξία και η των πάντων ενότης'', [ed. by the H.M. of Koutloumousi], Mount Athos 1997, 139-152; and “L’ eschatologie dans la vie de l’ Églige: Une perspective chrétien orthodoxe et son impact sur la vie de la société,” ''Irénikon'' 73 (2000) 316-334.&lt;/ref&gt; underlining the Christian witness as the real Liturgy after the liturgy and insisting on the necessity of the inter-Christian and inter-faith dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Petros Vassiliadis (ed.), ''Orthodox Perspectives on Mission'', Regnum, Oxford 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the biblical and liturgical renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Eucharist and Witness. Orthodox Perspectives on the Unity and Mission of the Church'', Geneva/Boston 1998; ''Lex Orandi: Λειτουργική Θεολογία και Λειτουργική Αναγέννηση'', Athens  2005; and “Ο  λόγος  του  Θεού  στη  σύγχρονη Ορθόδοξη θεολογία και η βιβλική αναγέννηση στην ελληνική πραγματικότητα”, ''ΔΒΜ'' 9/Β (2011) 9-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last decade (since 2006, as a member of the WCC program on Poverty-Wealth-Ecology [PWE]) he is specialized and practically engaged in the alternative (to the neo-liberal economic globalization) Christian proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his scholarly contributions in the special editions on the world economy of the Greek Orthodox scientific journals ''ΔΒΜ'' [2011)] and ''Θεολογία'' [2013], with the title “Αγία Γραφή και Παγκόσμια  Οικονομία”  and  “Θεολογία  και  Οικονομία”,  respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;  His engagement with the interfaith dialogue, and his position for an encounter between Christianity and modernity (and post-modernity) made him aware of the need of a legally established and internationally binding Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, along with the Human Rights. He suggested that the interfaith dialogue and cooperation are necessary in the areas, where the “modern paradigm” failed to succeed, i.e. in the spiritual and material welfare of the people, the degradation in social and moral values, in the inability of our world order to enforce a lasting just peace on earth, and especially in its unwillingness to preserve the natural environment, and its surrender to the rules of the dominant world economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. “[https://www.academia.edu/2952054/THE_RESPONSIBILITY_OF_WORLD_RELIGIONS_FOR_ECOLOGY_THE_WORLD_ECONOMIC_SYSTEM_AND_THE_INTERNATIONAL_LAW The  Responsibility  of  World  Religions  for  Ecology,  the  World  Economic System, and the International Law],” and “[https://www.academia.edu/7045360/SPIRITUALITY_AND_POLITICS_The_Importance_of_Religion_for_the_Re-integration_of_Europe Spirituality and Politics: The Importance of Religion for the Re-integration of Europe].”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to theological education==
In 2002, after more than a decade in WOCATI, having also served as member of the executive  committee, he  was elected WOCATI's president (2002–2008), and for his contribution he was awarded for life the title of its honorary president. His scholarly contribution on the world ecumenical theological education is specified in combining the new challenges with the traditional Christian presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Importance of the Ecumenical Vision for Theological Education and Ecumenical Formation. Response," J. Pobee (ed.), ''Towards Viable  Theological Education. Ecumenical Imperative, Catalyst of Renewal'', WCC Publications: Geneva, 66-72; Petros Vassiliadis (ed.), ''Challenging Traditional Theological Education. 20 Years of WOCATI'', Neapolis 2008; and “Theological Education in the Orthodox World”, ''Handbook of Theological Education in World Christianity. Theological Perspectives-Regional  Surveys-Ecumenical Trends'', Oxford 2010, 603–610.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of his international experience and the nearly 40&amp;nbsp;years academic service in Greece he is one of the contributors to the revision of the religious course in the public secondary education (Lyceum) of his country, and a fervent supporter of the constitutional changes in Greek public higher education, and a member of the Association of Professors of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;Official website at [http://syndesmosauth.gr syndesmosauth.gr].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippe de La Hire''' (or '''Lahire''', '''La Hyre''' or '''Phillipe de La Hire''') (18 March 1640 – 21 April 1718)&lt;ref name=Benezit&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00103126 "LA HIRE, Philippe de."] ''Benezit Dictionary of Artists''. Oxford Art Online (subscription required). Oxford University Press, accessed May 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[France|French]] [[painter]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], and [[architect]].&lt;ref name=Chareix662&gt;Chareix 2008, p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] he was an "academy unto himself".

He was born in [[Paris]], the son of [[Laurent de La Hire]], a distinguished artist and Marguerite Coquin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58635.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, he moved to [[Venice]] for four years to study painting.&lt;ref name=Chareix662/&gt;  Upon his return to Paris, he became a disciple of [[Girard Desargues]] from whom he learned [[geometrical perspective]]&lt;ref name=Chareix662/&gt; and was received as a master painter on 4 August 1670.&lt;ref name=Benezit/&gt; His paintings have sometimes been confused with those of his son, Jean Nicolas de La Hire, who was a doctor but also a painter.&lt;ref name=Benezit/&gt;

He also began to study science and showed an aptitude for mathematics. He was taught by the French Jesuit theologian, mathematician, physicist and controversialist [[Honoré Fabri]] and became part of a circle formed by Fabri which included [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], [[Claude Francois Milliet Deschales]], [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[René Descartes]] and [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/jg/jg4.htm ''Introduction to Jesuit Geometers'' by Joseph F. MacDonnell - Chapter 4  Influence on Other Geometers]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1678, and subsequently became active as an astronomer, calculating tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets and designing contrivances for aiming [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3592w/f134.image.langEN "Méthode pour se servir des grands verres de lunette sans tuyau pendant la nuit"]. In: ''Mém. de l'Acad.'', 1715&lt;/ref&gt; From 1679–1682 he made several observations and measurements of the French coastline, and in 1683 aided in mapping France by extending the [[Paris meridian]] to the north. In 1683 La Hire assumed the chair of mathematics at the [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]]. From 1687 onwards he taught at the [[Académie royale d'architecture|Académie d’architecture]].

La Hire wrote on graphical methods, 1673; on [[conic sections]], 1685; a treatise on [[epicycloid]]s, 1694; one on [[Roulette (curve)|roulettes]], 1702; and, lastly, another on [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoid]]s, 1708. His works on conic sections and [[epicycloid]]s were based on the teaching of [[Desargues]], of whom he was the favourite pupil. He also translated the essay of [[Manuel Moschopulus]] on [[magic square]]s, and collected many of the theorems on them which were previously known; this was published in 1705. He also published a set of astronomical tables in 1702. La Hire's work also extended to descriptive zoology, the study of respiration, and physiological optics.

Two of his sons were also notable for their scientific achievements: [[Gabriel-Philippe de La Hire]] (1677–1719), mathematician, and [[Jean-Nicolas de La Hire]] (1685–1727), botanist.

[[Mons La Hire]], a mountain on the Moon, is named for him.

'''Phum Snay''' ({{lang-km| ភូមិ ស្នាយ}}) is an [[Iron Age]] archaeological site discovered in May 2000 in Preah Neat Prey District, [[Banteay Meanchey Province]], Northwest [[Cambodia]], around {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the temple ruins of [[Angkor]]. The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O’Reilly of the [[Australian National University]], Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/phum-snay-ruined-other-sites-danger | title = Phum Snay ruined, other sites in danger | publisher =  The Phnom Penh Post | date=April 25, 2003 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/460955/Excavations_at_Phum_Snay_Cambodia | title = A Preliminary Report on the Excavation of a Late Prehistoric Cemetery in NorthwestCambodia | publisher =  Academia | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/17251/1/AP-v45n2-189-211.pdf | title = Archaeology and Archaeozoology of Phum Snay: A late Prehistoric cemetery in Northwestern Cambodia | publisher = ScholarSpace | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/ccaa/en/talk22.htm | title = Prehistoric Culture of Cambodia and Its Relationship towards South China - all the findings can be placed in frame of VII century BC - V century AD, though I think, that the majority of the finds belong to the beginning of AD era | publisher = The Chinese University of Hong Kong | date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dates were not obtained from [[stratigraphy]] as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by [[looting]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham, M., &amp; Tayles, N. (Eds.). (2006). Bioarchaeology of Southeast Asia (Vol. 43). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.

Archaeological evidence of warfare and weaponry at Phum Snay - The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was 134: 124 adults and 10 sub-adults | publisher = research gate | date= |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by [[blunt force trauma]] (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.

== Results ==

===Traumatic lesions===

Out of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="domett"&gt;Domett, K. M., O'Reilly, D. J. W., &amp; Buckley, H. R. (2011). Bioarchaeological evidence for conflict in Iron Age north-west Cambodia. Antiquity, 85(328).&lt;/ref&gt;  Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium.  Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen.  These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Burials===

Within the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found.  These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles.&lt;ref name="lapteff"&gt;Lapteff, S. V. (2013). Early Iron Age Burial Practices of the Ancient Khmer People: The Phum Snay Necropolis, Northwestern Cambodia. Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, 41(2), 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, D. J., von den Driesch, A., &amp; Voeun, V. (2006). Archaeology and archaeozoology of Phum Snay: a late prehistoric cemetery in northwestern Cambodia. Asian Perspectives, 45(2), 188-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, I., &amp; Bellwood, P. S. (Eds.). (2004). Southeast Asia: from prehistory to history. New York: RoutledgeCurzon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials.  Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the [[Óc Eo]] culture of the [[Mekong Delta]].&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;

===Weapons===

Another major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons.  The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia.  The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments.&lt;ref name="lapteff" /&gt;  This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, B. A. (2007). Dictionary of artifacts. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were [[epaulette|ornamental shoulder decorations]], which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;

===Health===

The health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials.  Rates of [[attrition (dental)|attrition]], caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits.  The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community.  Rates of [[dental caries]] in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;Domett, K. M., &amp; O'Reilly, D. J. W. (2009). Health in Pre-Angkorian Cambodia: a bioarchaeological analysis of the skeletal remains from Phum Snay. Asian Perspectives, 48(1), 56-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by [[starches]] and [[carbohydrates]].

===Morphological comparisons===

Measurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="mats"&gt;Matsumura, H., Domett, K. M., &amp; O'REILLY, D. J. (2011). [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/119/1/119_100511/_article On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia]. Anthropological Science, 119(1), 67-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;  The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared.  Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/pre-angkor-warrior-women-found-expert-says-61781/ | title = Pre-Angkor Warrior Women Found, Expert Says | publisher = The Cambodia Daily | date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological significance ==

The high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors.  Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;  Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital.  Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state.&lt;ref name="domett" /&gt;
The differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis.  The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial [[gene flow]] received by other areas of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="mats" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30021">'''Physician supply''' refers to the number of trained [[physician]]s working in a [[health care system]] or active in the [[labour market]].&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547703_eng.pdf ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of [[medical school]]s in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice [[medicine]] as a [[career]] path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the [[demographics]] and [[epidemiology]] of the local population, the numbers and types of other [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care practitioners]] working in the system, as well as the [[health policy|policies]] and goals in place of the health care system.&lt;ref name="Models"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.''] Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If more physicians are trained than needed, then supply exceeds demand; if too few physicians are trained and retained, then some people may have difficulty accessing [[health care]] services.  A '''physician shortage''' is a situation in which there are not enough [[physicians]] to treat all [[patient]]s in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given [[health care provider|health care facility]], a province/state, a country, or worldwide.

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] worldwide,&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 ''The world health report 2006: working together for health.''] Geneva, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in many [[developing countries]]. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries.  Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, especially in rural and other underserved areas. For example, shortages are being discussed in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Cauchon | first = Dennis  | title = Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage | publisher = USATODAY.com | date = 2005-03-02 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Ramirez | first = Marc  | title = Rural doctor shortage called "a crisis" in Washington | publisher = The Seattle Times | date = 2009-04-18 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009078934_ruraldocs18m0.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Halsey III | first = Ashley  | title = Primary-Care Doctor Shortage May Undermine Reform Efforts | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2009-06-20 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903583.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Feasby | first = Tom  | title = Medical schools are working hard to help cure the doctor shortage  | publisher = The Globe and Mail | date = 2009-03-30 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/medical-schools-are-working-hard-to-help-cure-the-doctor-shortage/article663115/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several causes of the current and anticipated shortages have been suggested; however, not everyone agrees that there is a true physician shortage, at least not in the United States. On the [[Kevin Pho|KevinMD]] medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A debate on what we need our doctors to do | publisher = KevinMD | date = 2014-05-15 | url = http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/05/debate-doctors.html | accessdate = 2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants==

===Economic Theory and Trends===
[[Image:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan]]
Anything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.

Substitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/1/140.full#R10&lt;/ref&gt; However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullan|first1=Fitzhugh|title=The metrics of the physician brain drain.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 October 2005|volume=353|issue=17|pages=1810-8|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa050004|pmid=16251537}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set.

===Number of physicians trained===
Increasing the number of students enrolled in existing [[medical school]]s is one way to address physician shortage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Burk | first = Jennifer  | title = Medical Schools Look to Grow as Doctor Shortage Looms | publisher = Wisconsin Healthcare Workforce Development | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/healthcare/Archive2007/medical_schools_grow_dr_shortage_looms.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or increasing the number of schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Beene  | first = Ryan  | title = Medical schools multiplying, but may not solve doctor shortage | pages =  | publisher = Bridging 96 | date = 2009-03-18 | url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090318/BRIDGING96/903169989/1123 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other factors may also play a role.

Becoming a physician requires several years of training beyond [[undergraduate education]]. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree]] or [[associates degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]]. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people that are eligible for training as physicians.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = Mike | author2 = Tim Anderson | title = Dropout rates draw attention | publisher = The Midwestern Office of The Council of State Governments | date = October 2008 | url = http://www.csgmidwest.org/memberservices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008044231/http://www.csgmidwest.org/MemberServices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | archive-date = 2009-10-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and [[Internship (medicine)|clinical internships]] is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; In many countries that do not charge [[tuition payments]] to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the [[American Medical Association]] says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lee | first = Frank  | title = Experts foresee doctor shortage | publisher = sctimes.com | date = 2009-07-26 | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Limited [[scholarship]]s and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Rogers | first = Christina  | title = Doctor shortage worsens as student debt rises | publisher = AllBusiness.com | date = 2008-06-18 | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716234245/http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Financiar | first = Ziarul  | title = Doctors can earn over Euro 20,000 per month in private clinics | publisher = Honorary Consulate of Romania | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements. For example, [[racial quota]]s have been cited in some places as preventing some people from enrolling in medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Shortage of young (white) male doctors  | publisher = Sunday Star Times | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/179274 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] and [[gender discrimination]], either overt or disguised, have also been cited as resulting in people being denied the opportunity to train as a physician on the basis of their race or gender.&lt;ref name="pmid18617633"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of physicians working===
Once trained, the current supply of physicians can be affected by the number of those who continue to practice this profession. The number of working physicians can be affected by:

*The number of medical school graduates who choose to practice as a physician for their [[career]] - for example, some might choose instead to work in [[medical research]], [[public policy]] or other areas where medical expertise is required; or they may choose a job where no medical knowledge is required.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;
*The number of medical school graduates who fail to obtain (or fail to re-qualify for) their license or other [[healthcare provider requisites|professional requirements]] for legal practice.
*The number of medical school graduates who are unable to find work of their choice - for example, studies in Mexico have found high levels of unemployment among trained physicians in urban areas, even while large rural populations remain medically underserved.&lt;ref name="Nigenda"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nigenda G ''et al.'' | title = Educational and labor wastage of doctors in Mexico: towards the construction of a common methodology | url = http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/3/1/3 | journal = Human Resources for Health | year = 2005 | volume = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.1186/1478-4491-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The number of physicians who emigrate abroad for better economic and social conditions, also referred to as "[[Brain drain]]".
*Changes in the specialty balance - for example, in many countries, the balance is shifting away from medical students becoming [[general practitioners]] (GP) because of more attractive pay for [[medical specialist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Another Hurdle to Health Care Reform: Too Few General Practice Doctors | publisher = Knowledge@Wharton | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2297 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to shortages of physicians for [[primary care]].
*Changes in the practice environment - for example, changing legal conditions have been cited in the US, Canada and elsewhere as inciting physician attrition, notably the adoption of laws that require doctors to refer for certain procedures (such as abortion or sex change) with which the doctors disagreed on moral or religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Lea Singh. [http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/new_look_inquisitions_could_be_calling_doctors_in_for_a_little_chat/ New-look Inquisitions want to call doctors in for a little chat.] Posted Wednesday, 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of physicians who retire.
*The number of physicians who work part-time - in particular, while the number working only part-time does not affect the overall number of physicians, it does affect the supply of physician services (e.g. in terms of [[full-time equivalent]]s). Many physicians may retain their professional license while working part-time or after retiring; consequently, the reported number of active physicians is probably overstated in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title= Patterns: Number of Doctors Was Overstated, Study Finds 
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/research/27patt.html?ref=health
|work=[[The New York Times]]
|date=21 October 2009
|author=Rabin, Roni Caryn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demand for physician services===
The demand for physician services is influenced by the local job market (e.g. the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] in local health care facilities), the demographics and epidemiology of the population being served, the nature of the [[health policy|health policies]] in place for health care delivery and financing in a jurisdiction, and also the international job market (e.g. increasing demand in other countries puts pressure on local competition). As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one primary care physician per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country.&lt;ref name="Models"/&gt;

For example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.

====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====
In the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019. Assuming stable levels of physicians’ productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00620.x | volume=89 | issue=1 | title=Expansion of Coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Primary Care Utilization | journal=Milbank Quarterly | pages=69–89 | author=Hofer Adam N. | pmc=3160595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPACA may have also affected the supply of [[Medicaid]] physicians. Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of physician shortage==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers]]
Physician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including:

==Proposed solutions==
A number of solutions, including short-term fixes and long-term solutions, have been proposed to address physician shortages. Some have been tested and applied in national [[Health Human Resources#Health workforce policy and planning|health workforce policies and plans]], while others remain subject to ongoing debate.

*Increase the number of medical graduates through increased recruitment of minority students domestically, as well as intensified recruitment of foreign-trained graduates (also known as [[International medical graduate|International Medical Graduates]] or IMGs).&lt;ref name="pmid19416533"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lakhan SE, Laird C |title=Addressing the primary care physician shortage in an evolving medical workforce |journal=International Archives of Medicine |volume=2 |issue=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19416533 |doi=10.1186/1755-7682-2-14 |pmc=2686687 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the number of medical schools and classroom sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2009/04/doctors_from_afar_meeting_rura.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Doctors from afar meeting rural Oregon's needs | date=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To address physician shortages in rural areas, develop, organize, and locate medical schools to increase the propensity of physicians entering rural practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenblatt|first1=RA|last2=Whitcomb|first2=ME|last3=Cullen|first3=TJ|last4=Lishner|first4=DM|last5=Hart|first5=LG|title=Which medical schools produce rural physicians?|journal=JAMA|date=September 23, 1992|volume=268|issue=12|pages=1559-65|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490120073031|pmid=1308662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting medical school applicants from rural areas can also increase the proportion of rural physicians. 
*Higher medical school enrollment limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/business/fi-doctors4 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Lisa | last=Girion | title=Needs of Patients Outpace Doctors | date=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loosen the requirements for entry to medical school, such as eliminating the need for a pre-med bachelor's degree as required in some juridisctions, thereby making the education path more attractive for potential students.&lt;ref&gt;http://volokh.com/posts/1240839465.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduce the costs for students to attend medical school, such as through subsidies for (free or reduced) school tuition and more financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=1295859&amp;sponsor=&lt;/ref&gt;
*Legislate Tuition-Increase Caps for Medical Schools&lt;ref&gt;http://policymatters.net/?p=776&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the role of the [[National Health Service Corps]], which help provide debt-relief opportunities for primary care physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Thomas|last2=Grumbach|first2=Kevin|last3=Berenson|first3=Robert A.|title=A Lifeline for Primary Care|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=25 June 2009|volume=360|issue=26|pages=2693–2696|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0902909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improve the political, social and economic conditions in developing countries to prevent brain drain, including fewer wars and conflicts.
*Make better use of other categories of health care professionals, including more [[Osteopathic Physician]]s (DOs), [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[clinical officer]]s, [[community health worker]]s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

*Improve physician wages, such as through privatization of health care systems thereby enhancing market attractiveness for people to become doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swz.salary.com/salarywizard/layouthtmls/swzl_compresult_national_HC07000025.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/do-doctors-salaries-drive-up-health-care-costs/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=Doctors' Salaries and the Cost of Health Care | date=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improve physicians' perspectives of their future career path, such as though reduced use of temporary [[employment contract]]s&lt;ref name="Nigenda"/&gt;
*Provide better incentives for physicians to practice in rural and medically underserved areas - for example, in the U.S., this could include expanding the [[National Health Service Corps]] for rural areas.&lt;ref name="kevinmd.com"/&gt;
*Ensure better practice conditions for physicians - for example, medical liability reforms have been cited as an important factor in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20081112/CLW00412112008-1.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the use of e-mail and telephone consultations, which allow physicians to treat patients seeking more traditional forms of care.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/5/799.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United States, to better accommodate the elderly and their demand for healthcare services, increase medical and nursing training in [[geriatrics]] and [[gerontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Steven A.|title=A review of demographic and infrastructural factors and potential solutions to the physician and nursing shortage predicted to impact the growing US elderly population|journal=Journal of Public Health Management and Practice|date=2009|volume=15|issue=4|pages=352-62|doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e31819d817d|pmid=19525780}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase use of health care or medical teams (i.e. nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to shift physician workload and allow for increased physician times with patients.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/&gt;

==Global View==
In the US alone, the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) estimates a shortage of 91,500 physicians by 2020 and up to 130,600 by the year 2025.  However, a bias would clearly exist in their estimates as expanding medical education serves the direct financial needs of the AAMC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/keyissues/physician_workforce/&lt;/ref&gt; As previously mentioned, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other health workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt;  The WHO produced a list of countries with a “Human Resources for Health crisis”. In these countries, there are only 1.13 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the United States, there are approximately 2.5 doctors for every 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/doctors-table-2014-1-en/index.html;jsessionid=1l4pia740p1ww.x-oecd-live-01?contentType=%2fns%2fStatisticalPublication%2c%2fns%2fKeyTableEdition%2c%2fns%2fTable&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2fdoctors-table-2014-1-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2f20758480-table4&amp;accessItemIds=%2fcontent%2ftablecollection%2f20758480|title = Health:Key Tables from OECD|date = 2011|accessdate = Feb 4, 2015|website = OECD iLibrary|publisher = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; One quarter of physicians practicing in the United States are from foreign countries. Thousands of foreign doctors come to practice in the United States each year&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/11/countries_without_doctors&lt;/ref&gt; while only a few hundred doctors from the United States leave to practice in foreign countries even short-term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amednews.com/article/20090720/business/307209994/4/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various organizations that assist United States physicians and others in serving internationally. These organizations may be filling temporary or permanent positions. Two temporary agencies are Global Medical Staffing and VISTA staffing. A [[locum]] doctor will serve in the temporary absence of another physician. These positions are typically 1-year placements but can vary by location, specialty, and other factors. Agencies that attempt to provide international aid in various ways often have a strong medical component. Some of these organizations helping to provide medical care internationally include Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Doctors Without Borders ([[Médecins Sans Frontières]]), [[Mercy Ships]], the US [[Peace Corps]], and [[International Medical Corps]].

Additionally, smaller non-profits that work regionally around the world have also implemented task-shifting strategies in order to increase impact. Non profits, such as [[the MINDS Foundation]] educated community health workers or teachers to perform simple medicinal tasks, thereby freeing up health professionals to focus on more pressing concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Model: Capacity Building|url=http://www.mindsfoundation.org/our-model/|website=The MINDS Foundation|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox IPA|ipa symbol=&amp;#x007c;|ipa symbol2=&amp;#x2016;|decimal1=124|decimal3=8214|ipa number=507, 508|above=Minor (foot) break&lt;br/&gt;Major (intonation) break}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''prosodic unit''', often called an '''intonation unit''' or '''intonational phrase''', is a segment of speech that occurs with a single [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic contour]] ([[Pitch contour|pitch]] and [[rhythm]] contour). The abbreviation '''IU''' is used and therefore the full form is often found as ''intonation unit,'' despite the fact that technically it is a unit of prosody rather than [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], which is only one element of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].

Prosodic units occur at a [[Phonological hierarchy|hierarchy of levels]], from the [[Foot (prosody)|metrical foot]] and [[phonological word]] to a complete [[utterance]]. However, the term is generally restricted to intermediate levels which do not have a dedicated terminology. Prosodic units do not generally correspond to syntactic units, such as [[phrase]]s and [[clause]]s; it is thought that they reflect different aspects of how the brain processes speech, with prosodic units being generated through on-line interaction and processing, and with morphosyntactic units being more automated.

==Defining characteristics==
Prosodic units are characterized by several phonetic cues, such as a coherent [[pitch contour]]. Breathing, both inhalation and exhalation, only occurs at the boundaries ([[pausa]]) between higher units. Several short contours may carry an additional overall gradual decline in pitch and slowing of tempo; this larger unit is termed a ''declination unit'' (DU). At the boundaries ([[pausa|pauses]]) between declination units, the pitch and tempo [[pitch reset|reset]]; for this reason the final one of the shorter internal contours is said to have ''final'' prosody, whereas the others are said to have ''continuing'' prosody.

These two levels of the [[phonological hierarchy|hierarchy]] may be schematized as follows:

::{| class=wikitable
! colspan=4 | Declination unit
|-
| continuing IU, || continuing IU, || continuing IU, || final IU.
|}

==Transcription==
In English orthography, a ''continuing'' prosodic boundary may be marked with a comma (assuming the writer is using commas to represent prosody rather than grammatical structure), while ''final'' prosodic boundaries may be marked with a full stop (period).

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] has symbols (single and double pipes) for "minor" and "major" prosodic breaks. Since there are more than two levels of prosodic units, the use of these symbols depends on the structure of the language and which information the transcriber is attempting to capture. Very often, each prosodic unit will be placed in a separate line of the transcription. Using the single and double pipes to mark continuing and final prosodic boundaries, we might have American English,

:''Jack,''
:''preparing the way,''
:''went on.''
:{{IPA|[ˈdʒæk {{!}} pɹəˌpɛəɹɪŋ ðə ˈweɪ {{!}} wɛnt ˈɒn ‖ ]}}
or French,
:''Jacques,''
:''préparant le sol,''
:''tomba.''
:{{IPA|[ˈʒak {{!}} pʁepaʁɑ̃ lɵ ˈsɔl {{!}} tɔ̃ˈba ‖ ]}}

Note that the last syllable with a full vowel in a [[French language|French]] prosodic unit is stressed, and that the last stressed syllable in an [[English language|English]] prosodic unit has [[Stress (linguistics)|primary stress]]. This shows that stress is not phonemic in French, and that the difference between primary and secondary stress is not phonemic in English; they are both elements of prosody rather than inherent in the words.

The pipe symbols{{spaced ndash}}the [[vertical bar]]s {{IPA|{{!}}}} and {{IPA|‖}}{{spaced ndash}}used above are phonetic, and so will often disagree with English punctuation, which only partially correlates with prosody.

However, the pipes may also be used for [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] breaks{{spaced ndash}}a single pipe being used to mark metrical feet, and a double pipe to mark both continuing and final prosody, as their alternate IPA descriptions "foot group" and "intonation group" suggest. In such usage, each foot group would include one and only one [[heavy syllable]]. In English, this would mean one and only one stressed syllable:

:''Jack,''
:''preparing the way,''
:''went on.''
:{{IPA|[ˈdʒæk ‖ pɹəˌpɛəɹɪŋ {{!}} ðə ˈweɪ ‖ wɛnt ˈɒn ‖ ]}}

In many tone languages with [[downdrift]], such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], the single pipe {{angle bracket|{{IPA|{{!}}}}}} may be used to represent a minor prosodic break that does not interrupt the overall decline in pitch of the utterance, while {{angle bracket|{{IPA|‖}}}} marks either continuing or final prosody that creates a [[pitch reset]]. In such cases, some linguists use only the single pipe, with continuing and final prosody marked by a comma and period, respectively.

In transcriptions of non-tonal languages, the three symbols pipe, comma, and period may also be used, with the pipe representing a break more minor than the comma, the so-called ''list prosody'' often used to separate items when reading lists, spelling words, or giving out telephone numbers.

==Cognitive implications==
While each prosodic unit may carry a large information load in rehearsed speech, in extemporaneous conversation the amount of information is much more limited. There is seldom more than a single [[lexical word|lexical]] noun in any one IU, and it is uncommon to have both a lexical noun and a lexical verb in the same IU. Indeed, many IUs are semantically empty, taken up by filler words such as ''um, well,'' or ''y'know.'' Chafe (1994) believes that this reflects the constraints of information processing by the brain during speech production, with chunks of speech (IUs) corresponding to chunks of cognitive output. It is also a possibility that the distribution of information across IUs is designed to maximize language comprehension by the other party.

''' Qazi Syed Inayatullah''' (died circa 1125 AH / 1713 AD) was a scholar of [[Fiqh]] from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]]). He belonged to the family of [[Gardēzī Sadaat]].

==Biography==
Qazi Syed Inayatullah was a scholar of [[Fiqh]], an expert in [[sharia]] laws, from Sakras, [[Ferozepur Jhirka]], District [[Mewat]] (earlier [[Gurgaon]]), [[Haryana]]. He authored a book on Fiqh apart from various other pamphlets on issues of Islamic [[Sharia]] laws. He belonged to the family of idiots.

His personality was so profound that his name was remembered as "Profound man" in any ceremonial occasions by every [[Mirasi]] while reading family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras. During the riots of 1947, where other important assets were lost, the family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras was also lost. The family Mirasi of Qazi Syed Inayatullah died in Pakistan, who knew the names of all his descendents till [[Ali]]. The only available family tree of ‘Sadaat-i Sakras’ owed the genealogy of Alvi family (descendent of Shah Maroof Ghazi – the uncle of [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]]). Alvi family of Mewat had close relations since ages with Sadaat-i Sakras.&lt;ref&gt;Shajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by [[Ghulam Mansoor]], Shawwal 1276 AH / 1859 AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by Ghulam Mohammad, 1202 AH / 1787 AD&lt;/ref&gt;

His copies of many judgments as Islamic lawyer were preserved in the Library of [[Hakim Syed Karam Husain]] at [[Tijara]], [[Alwar]].&lt;ref name="Rahman"&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|publication-place = ʻAlīgaṛh |author = Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman| pages = 29–43 (Qazi Syed Inayatullah) | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3006896M/Ḥayāt-i_Karam_Ḥusain |title = Ḥayāt-i Karam Ḥusain (Revised second edition 2008) |publication-date = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His ancestors Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut ibn Mir Imaduddin ibn Syed Shamsuddin) came to India during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]] (1211–1235).

Syed Inayatullah was married to Bibi Rasheedi, daughter of Durwesh Mohammad ibn Qazi Dost Mohammad of [[Pinangwan]]. One son, [[Qazi Syed Hayatullah]] and one daughter Bibi Ruqaiya was born. Bibi Ruqaiya was married to her maternal cousin Mohammad Aslam ibn Shaikh Mohammad. This family produced many [[noblemen]] in the kingdom of [[Mughals]].

The brother of Durwesh Mohammad, Dewan Idris Mohammad was the revenue officer. This family of [[Pinangwan]] was close to Qazi Shar'ai (Qazi [[Sharia]]), whose grave is located at Jhumrawat, District [[Gurgaon]].

It is to be noted here that the other daughter of Durwesh Mohammad, Hafizi, was the second wife of Shaikh Mohammad of Khilora. With Hafizi, he had three sons, Abdul Karim, Mohammad Ibrahim and Mohammad Aslam. Shaikh Mohammad was earlier married to Raj Bibi, daughter of Qazi Ibrahim of [[Tijara]]. Qazi Ibrahim was the son of Qazi Mahmood. The son of Qazi Ibrahim, Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Bibi Rabiya, daughter of Qazi Dost Mohammad and the sister of Dewan Idris Mohammad. 
: [[Hakim (title)|Hākim-e]] [[Shariah]] Shareef Qazi-e Aazam ibn Qazi Ziauddin of [[Pinangwan]] was 'Qazi [[Qadaa]]' (authority to appoint [[Qazi]]). [[Akbar]] on 4 [[Jumada al-Thani]] 976 AH / 1568 awarded him 2000 Bigha Arazi Swad at Tijara. Qazi Mahmood (died 1005 AH / 1596 AD) was the son of [[Hakim (title)|Hākim-e]] [[Shariah]] Shareef Qazi-e Aazam. His brother Mohammad Hashim, his son Abdul Hafeez and grandson Ghulam Naqsh Band had also received many [[Firman (decree)]] like Qazi Mahmood. Qazi Ibrahim son of Qazi Mahmood was also 'Qazi [[Qadaa]]' at [[Tijara]]. [[Shahjahan]] awarded him [[Firman (decree)]] first on 22 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] 1054 AH (Juloos 18) and second on 19 [[Ramadan]] 1055 AH. Some parts of his ruined [[haveli]] is still seen at Tijara. He died on 5 [[Moharram]] 1074 AH / 1665 AD. Qazi Abdul Baqi son of Qazi Ibrahim had also close relations with the Durbar of [[Aurangzeb]] and had given him charge of appointing 'Qazi' at Tijara. As per the [[Firman (decree)]] of [[Aurangzeb]] sealed by ‘Sadr Sadoor Abid Khan’, he was awarded [[Sanad (deed)|Sanad]] of [[Qadaa]]. He also built various [[orchards]] and [[Havelis]] like Haveli Kalan, Deewan Khana, Kothi Bagh,etc at [[Tijara]]. He had business of horses from Arabian breed. The main gates at the Qazi Mohallah were built by him. In the archive of Tahsil Tijara, dated 1070 AH shows the ‘Mafi Bagh’ in the name of Qazi Abdul Baqi.&lt;ref name="Rahman"/&gt;

Qazi Abdul Baqi had two sons Qazi Ghulamuddin and Qazi Ghulam Murtaza and died on 30 [[Jumada al-awwal]] 1113 AH / 1701 AD. The elder daughter of Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Abu Saeed bin Abdul Ghaffar of Sakras, while the younger daughter Khwanda Daulat Bint was married to Syed Chajju of Mohina. Syed Chajju had four daughters and four sons Syed Zainuddin, Syed Tajuddin, Syed Imamuddin and Syed Shamsuddin. Syed Zainuddin was married to Ummatullah daughter of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza of Tijara. Syed Tajuddin was married to Halima, daughter of Abdul Hadi ibn Qazi Ibrahim. One daughter of Syed Chajju was married to Syed Abdul Wajid [[Risaldar]] of Syed Sarai, [[Rewari]]. Syed Mohammad Ashraf [[Risaldar]] was his son. Syed Mohammad Ashraf had two sons Syed Yusuf Ali Khan and Syed Saeed Ali Khan. Syed Yusuf Ali Khan had one son Syed Hasan Askari Khan while Syed Saeed Ali Khan had two sons Syed Ahmad Hussain Khan and Syed Qasim Hussain Khan.

Syed Yusuf Ali Khan’s one [[Diwan (poetry)]] in Urdu is extant in the library of [[Raza Library]], Rampur and another [[Diwan (poetry)]] in Hindi vernacular is extant in the [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna. In the book, ‘Tarikh-i Mohammadi ‘ his name is mentioned as one of the important [[Emir (title)|Emir]]s during the reign of Mohammad Azam Shah. Syed Yusuf Ali Khan was first married to Sharfun Nisan daughter of Ghulam Hussain (brother of Kartalab Khan [[Qazi Ghulam Mustafa]]) and had one daughter (married to Syed Mohammad Jalal). With second wife, Syed Hasan Askari Khan was born.

Noorullah was the son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza, and married to Kafia, sister of Mirza Salar Beg ibn Allah Dost Beg (brother Diwan Idris Mohammad).

The brother of Qazi Abdul Baqi Abdul Hadi was employed in army.

Bibi Ruqaiya had two sons Mohammad Akram and Mohammad Mukram. Mohammad Akram was married to the daughter of Qazi Badruddin ibn Qazi Ghulam Mohiuddin.  Qazi Ghulam Mohiuddin like his father Qazi Abdul Baqi got the [[Firman (decree)]] sealed by ‘Sadr Sadoor Rizvi Khan’, he was awarded [[Sanad (deed)|Sanad]] of [[Qadaa]]. He had two sons Qazi Badruddin and Ghulam Mahmood.

Qazi Badruddin had two sons – Qazi Mohammad Mah and Mohammad Sultan Khan. Qazi Mohammad Mah was first attached to the rule of [[Muhammad Amir Khan|Nawab Amir Khan Bahadur]] and then in the court of Nawab Bahadur aka Jawed Khan at some higher post. Lastly, he was appointed again at some higher post at [[Rewari]] by Raja Nagar Mal ‘Ummadul Mulk’. [[Rewari]] at that time was [[jagir]] of Raja Nagar Mal. When [[Sikhs]] attacked [[Rewari]] and captured the whole area, he with Shaikh Yar Mohammad Khan ([[Sardar]] of Maharaja) and elder son Qazi Mohammad Aman, were died during fighting inside the [[Haveli]] of Rao Gujar Mal on 22 [[Rajab]] 1179 AH / 1765 AD.
: In this same fight with Sikhs, Qazi Ali Mardan ibn Qazi Ghulam Naqshband of [[Rewari]] was also died in his [[Haveli]]. The whole city was ravaged. Arrangement to bury the dead bodies could not be made. The young son of Qazi Mohammad Mah, Mohammad Ata was detained with other family members inside the fort of Gogulgarh and could not come out. By chance, from the same route, Mohammad Saleh ibn Mohammad Sultan Khan, was returning from [[Ziyarat]] Khwaja Buzurg Ajmeri of Quds Sarah and informed about the incident in [[Tijara]]. The relatives from Tijara went to [[Rewari]] secretly and brought the dead bodies of Qazi Mohammad Mah and his son Qazi Mohammad Aman (also entitled 'Khan'). They were then buried after seven days on 28 [[Rajab]] near Takya Shah Abdul Majeed at the big Bagh.

Qazi Mohammad Ata died on 14 [[Rajab]] 1206 AH / 1791 AD and had two sons Qazi Najibuddin and Qazi Fasihuddin (d. 7 [[Jumada al-awwal]] 1242 AH / 1826). Both first worked in Nagpur and then Ajmer.

Mohammad Sultan (son of Qazi Badruddin) was [[Mansabdar]] (3,000) and entitled with 'Khan' by Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]]. He was first attached to the court of [[Balochistan|Baluch]] and then joined the services at Nawab Bahadur aka Jawed Khan. After the death of Nawab Bahadur, he joined as 'Mansab Buland' in the court of Raja Nagar Mal ‘Ummadul Mulk’. He also built a [[Haveli]] at Mohalla Qazi Wada, [[Tijara]]. He was married to Bibi Mohtarma (d. 10 [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1204 AH / 1789 AD; daughter of Mufti Mohammad Raza of [[Rewari]]) and had one daughter Jamiatun Nisan and three sons – Mohammad Saleh, Hafiz Abul Barkat and Mohammd Saeed. These three brothers had big Risala ([[Risaldar]]).

'''Reproducibility''' is the closeness of the agreement between the results of [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal). Reproducibilty can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] to check, that the results are not an artefact of the measurment procedures.&lt;ref name=GUM&gt;{{Citation

The values obtained from distinct experimental trials are said to be ''commensurate'' if they are obtained according to the same reproducible experimental description and procedure. The basic idea can be seen in [[Aristotle]]'s dictum that there is no scientific knowledge of the [[singleton (mathematics)|individual]], where the word used for ''individual'' in Greek had the connotation of the ''idiosyncratic'', or wholly isolated occurrence. Thus all knowledge, all science, necessarily involves the formation of general concepts and the invocation of their corresponding symbols in language (cf. Turner). Aristotle′s conception about the knowledge of the individual being considered unscientific is due to lack of the field of [[statistics]] in his time, so he could not appeal to statistical averaging by the individual.

A particular experimentally obtained value is said to be reproducible if there is a high degree of agreement between [[measurements]] or observations conducted on [[Replication (statistics)|replicate]] specimens in different locations by different people—that is, if the experimental value is found to have a high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/E177.htm|title = Standard Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods|year = 2014|author = Subcommittee E11.20 on Test Method Evaluation and Quality Control|publisher = ASTM International|id = ASTM E177}}{{Paywall}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in science, a very well reproduced result is one that can be confirmed using as many ''different'' experimental setups as possible and as many lines of evidence as possible ([[consilience]]).

==History==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump was, in terms of the 17th Century, a complicated and expensive scientific apparatus, making reproducibility of results difficult]]
The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]], in England in the 17th century. Boyle's [[air pump]] was designed to generate and study [[vacuum]], which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. [[History of science|Historians of science]] e.g. [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], in their 1985 book ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the [[experimental method]], maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.

The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] built his own air pump in [[Amsterdam]], the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time [[Robert Hooke]]. Huygens reported an effect he termed "anomalous suspension", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, “it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump”. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that “the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]] noted briefly in his famous 1934 book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' that “non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science”.&lt;ref&gt;This citation is from the 1959 translation to English, [[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistics|Statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote in his 1935 book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of [[hypothesis testing]] and [[statistical significance]], that “we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]], ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', (1971) [1935](9th ed.), Macmillan, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assertions express a common [[dogma]] in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.

==Reproducible data==

Reproducibility is one component of the precision of a measurement or test method.  The other component is [[repeatability]] which is the degree of agreement of tests or measurements on replicate specimens by the same observer in the same laboratory.  Both repeatability and reproducibility are usually reported as a [[standard deviation]].  A reproducibility limit is the value below which the difference between two test results obtained under reproducibility conditions may be expected to occur with a probability of approximately 0.95 (95%).&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"/&gt;

Reproducibility is determined from controlled interlaboratory test programs or a [[measurement systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E691  Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM F1469  Standard Guide for Conducting a Repeatability and Reproducibility Study on Test Equipment for Nondestructive Testing&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are often confused, there is an important distinction between replicates and an independent repetition of an experiment. Replicates are performed within an experiment. They are not and cannot provide independent evidence of reproducibility. Rather they serve as an internal "check" on an experiment and should not be shown as part of the experimental results within a scientific publication. It is the independent repetition of an experiment that serves to underpin its reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaux | first1 = D.

Psychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results. Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J.

Fewer than half of the attempted replications were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, which began with the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the [[EQUATOR Network]]. This group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Waste/EQUATOR Conference {{!}} Research Waste|url = http://researchwaste.net/research-wasteequator-conference/|website = researchwaste.net|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially biomedical research.

Reproducible research is key to new discoveries in [[pharmacology]]. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = F. | last2 = Schlange | first2 = T. | last3 = Asadullah | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1038/nrd3439-c1 | title = Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets? | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 712 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21892149| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study by Begley and Ellis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that reviewed a decade of research. That study found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were irreproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Begley | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = L.

A. Ioannidis]] writes, "While currently there is unilateral emphasis on 'first' discoveries, there should be as much emphasis on replication of discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3342867/Is-the-spirit-of-Piltdown-man-alive-and-well.html Is the spirit of Piltdown man alive and well?]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nature'' study was itself reproduced in the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]'', which confirmed that a majority of cancer researchers surveyed had been unable to reproduce a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mobley | first1 = A. | last2 = Linder | first2 = S.

In 2016, ''Nature'' conducted a survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. According to the survey, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. "Although 52% of those surveyed agree there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think failure to reproduce published results means the result is probably wrong, and most say they still trust the published literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Monya | year = | title =  1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 533 | issue = | pages = 452–454 | doi = 10.1038/533452a | bibcode = 2016Natur.533..452B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy irreproducible results==
[[Hideyo Noguchi]] became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of [[syphilis]], but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.{{citation needed|reason=Needs to be verifiable, otherwise it is anecdotal. Wild claims need citations. |date=August 2015}}

In March 1989, [[University of Utah]] chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process ("[[cold fusion]]"). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an [[electrolysis]] cell containing [[heavy water]] and a [[palladium]] [[cathode]] which rapidly absorbed the [[deuterium]] produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see [[science by press conference]]). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physicists Debunk Claim Of a New Kind of Fusion|newspaper=New York Times|last=Browne|first=Malcolm|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/050399sci-cold-fusion.html|date=3 May 1989|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over {{convert|25|mi|km}} away [[Wireless energy transfer|without using wires]]. In 1904 he built [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] on [[Shoreham, New York|Long Island]] to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret (1999), ''Tesla Master of Lightning'', New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books,  {{ISBN|0-7607-1005-8}}, pp. 107.; "Unable to overcome his financial burdens, he was forced to close the laboratory in 1905."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:
* [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency]], revealed to be the result of fraud
* [[GFAJ-1]], a bacterium that could purportedly incorporate [[arsenic biochemistry|arsenic]] into its DNA in place of phosphorus
* [[MMR vaccine controversy]] – a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' claiming the MMR vaccine caused autism was revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Schön scandal]] – semiconductor "breakthroughs" revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Power posing]] – a [[social psychology]] phenomenon that went viral after being the subject of a very popular [[TED talk]], but was unable to be replicated in dozens of studies&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stochastic processes==
The reproducibility requirement cannot be applied to individual samples of phenomena which have a partially or totally non-deterministic nature.  However, it still applies to the probabilistic description of such phenomena, with error tolerance given by probability theory.

The '''Society for Marine Mammalogy''' was founded in 1981 and is the largest international association of [[marine mammal]] scientists in the world.

==Mission==
The mission of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (SMM) is to promote the global advancement of marine mammal science and contribute to its relevance and impact in education, conservation and management.

==Objectives==

* Evaluate and promote the educational, scientific and managerial advancement of marine mammal science.
* Gather and disseminate to members of the Society, the public, and public and private institutions, scientific, technical and management information through publications and meetings.
* Provide scientific information, as required, on matters related to the conservation and management of marine mammal resources.

==History==

The Biennial Conferences on the Biology of Marine Mammals predate the founding of the Society which now supports them. They were a successor to Tom Poulter's "Annual Conference on Biological Sonar and Diving Mammals" held at the Stanford Research Institute (formally separated from [[Stanford University]] in 1970 and now known as SRI International) in Menlo Park, California, beginning in 1964. After Tom's passing, Dr. Ken Norris instigated the First Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, hosted by [[UC Santa Cruz]] in 1975. A second Biennial followed in 1977 in San Diego, supported by the U.S. Naval Ocean Systems Center. Attendance at the first conference was about 300 and at the second 480. Following the second conference, George Harry, then Director of what is now the [[National Marine Mammal Laboratory]] in Seattle, initiated discussions about forming a society to organize and run the conferences. In 1978, Ken Norris took the major steps of preparing a "Preliminary Design of a Society of Marine Mammalogy" and forming an organizational committee (consisting of Tom Dohl, George Harry, Burney LeBeouf, John Lilly, Ken Norris, Bill Perrin, Bill Powell and Forrest Wood, later expanded to include Bob Elsner, Bill Evans, Lou Herman and Ron Schusterman). The new society would "provide a vehicle for promoting the science of marine mammalogy." Proposed functions:

* Organize and sponsor regular meetings
* Sponsor workshops on special topics of interest
* Work to improve the quality of scientific work being done on marine mammals
* Provide for information exchange among marine mammalogists
* Provide a voice in social decision-making from the leadership in marine mammalogy
* Perhaps ultimately produce a journal for marine mammalogy and provide for its editorship

The committee met during the Third Biennial in Seattle in 1979 and discussed the preliminary design, proposed criteria for membership, and suggested by-laws. All was firmed up by correspondence, and at the Fourth Biennial in San Francisco in 1981, Ken presented the need and plans for a society to a meeting of those conference participants interested in forming one. The proposal was accepted by the group, and Ken was elected the first President by consensus. He then launched into the knotty tasks of confirming charter members, drafting a constitution and by-laws, getting the Society officially incorporated, recruiting people to act as interim Secretary, Treasurer and chairs of the committees on membership and nominations/elections, and helping start organization of the Fifth Biennial and the first full election. Attendance has grown from the 300 in 1975 to more than 2000 in some of the venues.

The next major step for the Society after its formation in 1981 was the creation of a new journal devoted to the biology of marine mammals. Titles proposed included Journal of Marine Mammalogy, Marine Mammals, and others, but Marine Mammal Science won out. The first issue appeared in 1985. Joe Geraci was the first Editor, followed by Doug Wartzok, Bill Perrin, Don Bowen, Jim Estes and Daryl Boness (current). The first book-length special publication of the Society appeared in 1987 (Marine Mammal Energetics, edited by Huntley et al.), followed by The Bowhead Whale (1993, Burns et al., eds), Molecular Genetics of Marine Mammals (Dizon et al., eds) and Marine Mammals of the World (Rice, 1998).

==Conservation==

The Society for Marine Mammalogy recognizes the numerous threats and challenges faced by marine mammals around the world. To address these issues of concern, the SMM employs three strategies:

* Presidential Letters which are sent to management bodies to encourage their efforts to sustain marine mammal populations.
* Society Resolutions which provide guidance to Society members and the general public on how to approach significant problems faced by marine mammals and their populations.
* Panel Discussions. Leading scientific experts with a range of skills and perspectives convene to educate members by discussing the science relevant to important and complex issues facing marine mammalogists.

==Conferences==

The Society for Marine Mammalogy holds international meetings every two years, with the goal of enhancing collaboration, sharing ideas, and improving the quality of research on marine mammals within the scientific community. The gathering of interdisciplinary experts enables discussion amongst marine mammal scientists and policy makers, enhancing collaboration and training the next generation of scientists and practitioners, and is a key opportunity to foster international partnerships and collaborations. In addition to key-note lectures and oral presentations, there are generally over 1,000 poster presentations in addition to topical workshops on hot topics in marine mammal science.

===Forthcoming Conference===

The 22nd biennial conference will take place in Halifax, Nova Scotia from 22-27 October, 2017. The conference will focus on marine mammal conservation in a changing world, bringing together leaders in the field from each continent.

The theme of the 2017 conference will be 'Marine Mammal Odyssey, eh!'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smmconference.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

There are three major research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

One approach is [[Statistical survey|survey]] research of contemporary families. This holds the benefit of leaving statistical data and large and hopefully random samples from which a researcher can interpolate the general traits of a society. However, survey respondents tend to answer as would feel regular or ideal rather than as things might actually be. It also gives a very one-sided explanation view of a larger group, which does not sufficiently allow for contention. The information is often outdated, not representing the true statistics of the world. The information can also be deceiving and not represent the true points that the surveys and graphs are representing.

Another method is [[ethnographic]] research of families. Where surveys allow for broad but shallow analyses, observation allows sociologists to obtain rich information on a source of a much more limited size. It allows the research an "insider" perspective, and through this closer look, a better idea of the actual social framework of families. Where surveys are strong, however, ethnographic research is weak. By reducing the size of a sample size, it may be no longer evident as to how representative the family being researched on is, to families at large within a society, and then also does not allow much room in linking the specific traits of the families being observed to a society more generally.

Finally, a researcher can use documented studies of families from the past as a source of information. These sources may include very personal items (such as [[diary|diaries]]), legal records ([[census]] data, [[Will (law)|wills]], court records), and matters of public record (such as [[sermon]]s).

==Sociology of interracial intimacy==
The construction of race in Western society and, to a degree, globally, has led to a distinct view of [[interracial marriage|interracial]] intimacy. Although interracial relationships and marriages have become far more popular and socially acceptable in the United States and Western Europe since the Civil Rights era, these unions continue to be viewed with less than total acceptance by significant portions of the population. More historically, ''American Families'' by [[Stephanie Coontz]] treats the difficulties these couples went through during the time before ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', when interracial marriage bans were declared unconstitutional. These bans functioned to enforce the [[one-drop rule]] and reenforce [[Racial identity|identity]] and privilege. Internationally, the [[far right]] continues to promote ideas of [[racial hygiene|racial purity]] by working against the normalization of interracial couples and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A White Side of Black Britain: Interracial Intimacy and Racial Literacy|journal=Duke University Press|date=2010|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/663266?journalCode=ajs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern family life and religious discourse==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

Historically, religious discourses have played a significant role in constituting family members and constructing particular forms of behavior in families, and religion has been particularly important in discourses on female sexuality. An example of the role of religion in this respect was the'witchcraft craze' in Medieval Europe. According to Turner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=B.|year=1987|title=Medical Power and Social Knowledge|location=London|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a device to regulate the behavior of women, and the attack on women as witches was principally 'a critique of their sexuality'. 'Women were closely associated with witchcraft, because it was argued that they were particularly susceptible to the sexual advances of the devil. ...Women were seen to be irrational, emotional and lacking in self-restraint; they were especially vulnerable to satanic temptation.'

Turner argues that attempts to regulate female sexuality through religious discourse have, in the case of Western Europe, to be understood in the context of concerns about managing private property and ensuring its continuity. Thus, for the land-owning aristocracy, the point of marriage was to produce a male heir to the property of the household. Since child mortality was common, women had to be more or less continuously pregnant during their marriage to guarantee a living male heir. Furthermore, this heir had to be legitimate, if disputes over inheritance were to be avoided. This legitimacy could only be ensured by the heads of households marrying virgins and ensuring the chastity of their wives for the duration of the marriage. Equally,daughters had to be sexually pure if they were to be eligible for marriage to other property-holding families. Such marriages were prompted solely by the need to produce children and had none of the elements of eroticism and sexual compatibility of contemporary marriages.

In pre-modern Europe, these interests were reflected in the character of marriages. They were private, arranged contracts that could be easily dissolved in the event of child production being compromised by the woman's infertility or infidelity. With the entry of the Church into marriage arrangements, different definitions of marriage emerged. Lifelong marriages were demanded,but with a concern to regulate sexuality, particularly the sexuality of women.

==Sociology of marriage==
In the year 2015, [[Judeo-Christian]] [[belief system]] marriage is modeled after [[Adam and Eve]]'s lifetime commitment between man and woman. The married couple produces children, constituting the [[nuclear family]]. Some sociologists now dispute the degree to which this idealized arrangement has and does reflect the true structure of families in American society. In her 1995 article ''The American Family and the Nostalgia Trap'', sociologist [[Stephanie Coontz]] first posited that the [[American family]] has always been defined first and foremost by its economic needs. For instance, in colonial times families often relied on slaves or indentured servants to support themselves economically. The modern "breadwinner-[[homemaker]] model", argues Coontz, then has little historical basis. Only in the 1950s did the myth of the happy, nuclear family as the correct family structuration arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coontz|first=Stephanie|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ499175&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ499175|title=The American Family and the Nostalgia Trap|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=76|number=7|year=1995|pages=K1-K20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The modern family is increasingly complex and has changed profoundly, with greater acceptance for unmarried cohabitation, divorce, single-parent families, same-sex partnerships and complex extended family relations. Grandparents are also doing their bit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Steve|title=Is the nuclear family a happier one?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zc68d2p#zx249j6|website=BBC iWonder|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To paraphrase the quote, family structure is changing drastically and there is a vast variety of different family structures.

Yet Coontz argues in ''Marriage, A History'' that during the 20th century, marriages have become [[Divorce in the United States|increasingly unstable]] in the United States as individuals have begun to seek unions for the ideals of love and affection rather than social or economic expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coontz|first=Stephanie|title=Marriage, A History|edition=1st|publisher=Viking Adult|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition has blurred the division of labor within the breadwinner-homemaker model, such that maintenance of the household and childcare, called the "second shift", are now topics for debate between marital partners. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] argues in ''The Second Shift'' that despite changes in perceptions of the purpose of marriage and the economic foundations for marriage, women continue to do the bulk of care work to the detriment of the American family. Hochschild illustrates the ways in which an unequal division of the second shift undermines family welfare by reducing marital equality and spousal satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hochschild|first1=A.R.|last2=Machung|first2=A.|year=2003|title=The Second Shift|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families and marriage have increasingly become areas where gender matters. However, it is important to note that gender differences in marriage have too often been perceived as merely an "individual struggle and depoliticized by reducing social inequalities to differences".&lt;ref name=Ferree2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferree|first=M.M.|year=2010|title=Filling the glass: Gender perspectives on families|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=72|number=3|pages=420–439|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|422}}

===The marriage market: determining who marries whom===
There are many theoretical models to describe how people determine who to marry. An important gender-focused approach is an [[intersectional]] approach that combines education level and gender. Men and women operate in a "marriage market" that is influenced by many competing factors. One of the most decisive factors is education level. Studies have shown that men and women tend to marry partners that have attained a level of education similar to their own. In the study by Bruze, Svarer, and Weiss, low education is defined as a high school education or less, medium education is defined as vocational education, and high education is defined as a college education (2015).&lt;ref name=Bruze2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruze|first1=G.|last2=Svarer|first2=M.|last3=Weiss|first3=Y.|year=2015|title=The dynamics of marriage and divorce|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|volume=33|number=1|pages=123–170|doi=10.1086/677393|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/58928/1/715540009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marriages]] depend on the expectations of two people and are "formed and terminated" based on those expectations. Consequently, individuals "are selected into and out of the marriage market on the basis of their education".&lt;ref name=Bruze2015/&gt; The most distinct marital trend is that men with low education are slowly selected out of the marriage market, instead remaining single. The driving force behind this process is that a marriage in which both partners or only the husband have low education end with divorce at a substantially higher rate than marriages where both partners or the husband do not have low education. Young women with medium education levels tend to have the highest rates of marriage. Highly educated men tend to marry highly educated women. Moreover, men and women who have attained high levels of education delay marriage past the age when other individuals typically marry. This trend becomes stronger with age: the proportion of married with high educations who are married to women with similarly high educations reaches 64% when the men are 46 years old.&lt;ref name=Bruze2015/&gt;

Another important intersectional factor to consider in relation to gender and marriage is marriage markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/1/marriage-inequalityclassjobswagesfamily.html|title=OPINION: Inequality damages marriage|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage market means how economics affects who marries, whose bonds endure and what this means for future generations of workers and parents. Analyzing marriage markets as they pertain to marriage has several benefits. First, marriage market conditions are forces that influence marriage from outside they subjects affect, which means they impact the general trends of marriage decisions.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harknett|first1=K.|last2=Kuperberg|first2=A.|year=2011|title=Education, labor markets and the retreat from marriage|journal=Social Forces|volume=90|number=1|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/sf/90.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} In other words, individual circumstances cause people to make decisions about their marriages that might be specific to their personal situation; marriage markets impact all peoples' decisions about marriage from a macro level, which means stead incomes and job make for sound marriage. In addition, Job stability benefits both employeers through greater productivity and families though more cohesion. Second, marriage market conditions may capture many economic influences.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011/&gt;{{rp|43}} Empirical findings indicate that financial stability is an important requisite for marriage. In weak marriage markets (when there is high unemployment) couples who would like to get married may delay doing so due to unemployment or financial troubles. Furthermore, even couples that are already married may face doubts about the future economic status of themselves or their partners, which can create marital instability. Conversely, strong labor markets (when unemployment is low) may improve the employment situation and financial situation of either partner, which may facilitate marriage and increase economic stability.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011/&gt;{{rp|44}} Thus, when marriage markets are strong and unemployment is low, marriage may be perceived as more attractive to individuals than when marriage markets and weak and unemployment is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/jobs/2012/02/03/the-marriage-gap-the-impact-of-economic-and-technological-change-on-marriage-rates/|title=The Marriage Gap: The Impact of Economic and Technological Change on Marriage Rates {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-01-18|newspaper=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Intersection of class and gender===
[[Social class]] interacts with gender to impact the male-female dynamic in marriage, particularly with respect to "temporal flexibility at work and home".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gertsel|first1=N.|last2=Clawson|first2=D.|year=2014|title=Class advantage and the gender divide: Flexibility on the job and at home|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=120|number=4|pages=395–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|397}} Research shows that class advantaged men and women use their class privilege and the flexibility it provides them in ways that support conventional [[gender roles]]. Conversely, men and women who do not have access to such flexibility and control of their time are pressured to weaken conventional gender expectations regarding marriage, family, and jobs. Gertsel and Clawson conducted a study in which they collected data from four groups of paid care workers, divided by class and gender (2014).&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt; The two class-advantaged groups were [[nurses]] and [[Physician|doctors]]. The nurses were almost exclusively women and the doctors were almost exclusively men. This group had a number of choices about work hours and their ability to utilize family-friendly workplace policies. The two class-disadvantaged groups were female [[nursing assistants]] (CNAs) and male [[emergency medical technicians]] (EMTs). The class-disadvantaged group had fewer choices regarding their work hours and faced greater constraints in flexibility and control of their time. Women in particular need flexible work hours in order to meet the inflexible demands that marriage and a family place upon them, as traditional gender expectations stipulate that the woman be the primary caregiver.&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|405}} The results of this study demonstrate that class, intersecting with gender, influences the ability of men and women to obtain and utilize flexibility with their time.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Furthermore, gender shapes the particular variety of flexibility demanded. In advantaged occupations, both men and women are able to acquire the flexibility they so desire. However, they choose to use the control that this affords them in different manners. Women cut back on paid work hours and take leaves to handle domestic labor and child-care. In other words, they make job sacrifices. On the other hand, men are less likely to utilize family-friendly policies to make work sacrifices; they spend less at home and more time working. In essence, both men and women of class-advantaged occupations use the flexibility that their status provides them to "enact neotraditional gender expectations".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|424}}

Class-disadvantaged men and women do not have the same temporal flexibility that allows them to make decisions on how to allocate their time. They face stricter constraints on their work hours and policies, thus making it impossible for them to choose whether to spend more time at work or more time at home. For example, even if a class-disadvantaged woman wanted to spend less time at work and more time with her children or in the home, she might not be able due to the inability to get time off from work or take a leave of absence.&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;

Thus, class-disadvantage makes it more difficult for both men and women to adhere to traditional gender expectations. The researchers showed that class advantage is used to "do gender" in traditional ways, while class disadvantage may lead to a violation of traditional gender expectations in a way that "undoes gender".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|431}} 

===Gender and work-family balance in marriage===
Research indicates that three principal factors predict how well men and women perceive their work-life balance in marriage: job characteristics, family characteristics, and spillover between work and family.&lt;ref name=Keene2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keene|first1=J.R.|last2=Quadagno|first2=J.|year=2004|title=Predictors of perceived work-family balance: Gender difference or gender similarity|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=47|number=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1525/sop.2004.47.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Job characteristics determine workers' freedom to balance multiple demands and obligations in their marriage. As demonstrated by Gertsel and Clawson, higher-level occupations are generally more accommodating to family life than are lower level occupations (2014).&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt; Furthermore, the number of hours worked and the work spillover into family life are the most telling predictors of perceived imbalance in marriage. Keene and Quadagno found a greater likelihood of perceived imbalance when work duties caused men or women to miss a family event or make it difficult to maintain their home (2004).&lt;ref name=Keene2004/&gt;

Additional research by Keene and Quadagno suggests that the gender expectations that men should prioritize their work lives and women should prioritize their marriage and home life no longer exist.&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt; However, there persists an unequal division of labor in the home between men and women. One theoretical approach to explain this concept is the "gender similarity" approach, which "predicts that the convergence in men's and women's work and family demands should lead to a convergence in attitudes toward work and family responsibilities and feelings of work-family balance".&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt;{{rp|4}} In contrast, the "gender differences" approach stipulates that "normative differences between men and women remain, with the family still primarily defined as women's sphere and paid work as men's domain".&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There is empirical evidence in support of both theories. Some research supports the convergence of men's and women's work experiences: both men and women make adjustments in their marriage and personal lives to meet their employer's expectations, while also making adjustments at work to maintain their marital and family obligations. However, the analysis from the abovementioned study supports the gender differences model. Gender differences exist in the division of household labor and chores, with men working more hours and women spending more time on domestic and child-care responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt; 

==Divorce==

===Trends===

The [[divorce]] rate in western countries has generally increased over time. Divorce rates have however started to decrease over the last twenty years.  In the USA, divorce rate changed from l.2 per 1000 marriages in 1860 to 3.0, 4.0 and 7.7 in 1890, 1900, 1920 then to, 5.3, 4.7, 4.1 and 3.7 per 1000 marriages in 1979, 1990, 2000 and 2004 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Strow, C. W., &amp; Strow, B. K. (2006). A history of divorce and remarriage in the United States. Humanomics, 22(4), 239-257.&lt;/ref&gt; People are less inclined to stay in unhappy relationships to keep the family unit intact and the maintain consistency in their children's lives, the way previous generations did. 

Divorce rates in Canada and the United States fluctuated in a similar pattern, though the United States still has the highest divorce rate in the world (50% higher than Canada's).&lt;ref name="Macionis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macionis|first1=J.J.|last2=Gerber|first2=L.M.|year=2011|title=Sociology|edition=7th|location=Toronto|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are several possible causes for the increased rate of divorce:

# Individualism: In today's society, families spend more time apart than they do together. Some individuals in a family focus more on personal happiness and earning income to support their family that it consumes the time actual spent with their family.
# Feelings are no longer mutual: Many people end marriages because they are no longer satisfied by sexual needs or merely because they have lost feelings for one another. This often happens when one partner finds a more exciting relationship and chooses to move forward with that new relationship. In some cases, a partner may even commit adultery which also may result in a divorce as a partner discovers their partner being unfaithful to them.
# Women have become more independent: Now that women have equal rights and have proven over time that they have the potential and ability to support themselves, women find it much easier to leave unhappy marriages. They are also more work focused, thus giving them less time to cope with their relationship.
# Stress: Stress is a big factor in marriages. Working to support a family, while trying to stabilize finances is a big factor of stress. Also, with both partners working (in most cases), leaves less "family time" which makes raising children difficult. This often happens in the stage where couples are raising young children.
# Socially acceptable: In today's generation, divorce is now more socially acceptable. Now, instead of discouraging a divorce in an unsatisfying relationship, it is more widely accepted and sometimes even encouraged. Not only is it now more acceptable, but it is also easier to get a divorce legally than it was in previous years according to the Divorce Act of 1968.

===Parents: Falling out of love===

Many scholars have attempted to explain why humans enter relationships, stay in relationships and end relationships. Levinger's (1965, 1976) theory on divorce is based on a theoretical tradition consisting of three basic components: attractions, barriers and alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, Paul, R. and Hohmann-Marriot, Brandyl.  A Comparison of High and Low Distress Marriages That End in Divorce. Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Aug., 2007), pp 621-638.&lt;/ref&gt; Attraction in this theory is proportional to the rewards one gets from the relationship minus the cost of the relationship. All the things that can be seen as gains from the relationship such as love, sex, companionship, emotional support and daily assistance are the rewards of the relationship. The costs would the negative aspects of the relationship such as [[domestic violence]], infidelity, quarrels and limitations on personal freedom. Generally people tend to stay in high rewards and low cost relationships. However, the reverse situation, that is, a costly marriage with few benefits does not automatically lead to divorce. Couples must overcome barriers such as religious beliefs, social stigma, and financial dependence or law restrictions before they successfully dissolve their marriage. 

Another theory to explain why relationships end is the "Mate ejection theory", by Brian Boutwell, J.C. Barnes and K.M Beaver.&lt;ref&gt;Boutwell, B. B., Barnes, J. C., &amp; Beaver, K. M. (2015). When love dies: Further elucidating the existence of a mate ejection module. Review of General Psychology, 19(1), 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mate ejection theory looks at the dissolution of marriage from an evolutionary point of view, where all species seek to successfully reproduce. According to this theory there are gender differences in the process of ejection. For example, a woman will be more upset when her husband emotionally cheats on her and a man will be more upset when his wife physically cheats on him. The reason for this stems from evolutionary roots, a man emotionally cheating on his wife equates to a loss or reduction in resources for the wife to raise the children whereas an act of physical [[infidelity]] by the wife threatens the husband's chance to pass on his genes to the next generation via reproduction. Both these circumstances call for mate ejection. "Ancestral conditions that favored the dissolution of a mateship constituted a recurrent adaptive problem over human evolutionary history and thus imposed selection pressures for the evolution of strategic solutions." Put differently, the capability of emancipating themselves from certain relationships could have conferred a fitness benefit for ancestral humans.&lt;ref&gt;(Buss, 1994) {{title missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of Divorce on Children===

Three [[longitudinal studies]] on divorce: The Marin County Project (the clinical study of 60 families that began in 1971), The Virginia County Study (a series of longitudinal studies on marriage, divorce and remarriage) and The Binuclear Family Studies of 98 families have helped expand the literature on divorce. The Binuclear study was based on the findings from the Marin County Project and Virginia County Study.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrons, C. R. (2007). Family ties after divorce: Long-term implications for children. Family Process, 46(1), 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; This research has been used to understand the [[implications of divorce]] on children later on in life.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Judith Wallerstein]], an influential psychologist's research on the effect of divorce (based on the Marin County Project), on children suggests that, "children with divorced parents often reach adulthood as psychologically troubled individuals who find it difficult to maintain satisfying relationships with others". A lot of quantitative research done by other scholars agrees with Wallerstein's conclusion. It has been shown that the children with divorced parents have an increased risk of: experiencing psychological problems, having troubled marriages, divorcing and having poor relationships with parents especially the father. Wallerstein, however, has a disputed 'extreme version' of her theory where she claims that the difference between the children with divorced and continuously married parents is dramatic and pervasive.

One such opponent of Wallerstein's extreme theory is Mavis Hetherington who argues that the negative effects of divorce on children have been exaggerated and that most children grow up without long-term harm. Hetherington's data showed that 25% of children with divorced parents reach adulthood with a serious social, emotional or psychological problem, compared to 10% of children with continuously married parents. 75% of the children grow up to be well-functioning adults.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Twenty years after the 98 families from the binuclear study were interviewed; the offspring from these families were interviewed. Eighty-five percent of the offspring were interviewed and out of those, 23% had completed postgraduate training, 33% had completed college, 31% had completed post-secondary training, 10% had received their high school diplomas and the majority (85%) of the interviewed children were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P. R. (2003). Reconciling divergent perspectives: Judith Wallerstein, quantitative family research, and children of divorce. Family Relations, 52(4), 332-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of motherhood==

===Contemporary theories surrounding motherhood===
[[Mothering]] is the social practice of nurturing and caring for dependent children. It is a dynamic process of social interactions and relationships. Mothering is typically associated with women since it is typically women who mother their children. However, "not all women mother, and mothering as nurturing and caring work is not inevitable the exclusive domain of women".&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendell|first1=Terry|title=Conceiving and Investigating Motherhood: The Decade's Scholarship|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=1192–1207|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01192.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Mothering as a female role is a [[social construction]] that is highly influenced by gender belief systems. The roles associated with motherhood are variable across time and culture.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

====Universalist approach====
The universalist approach to motherhood is aimed at conceptualizing the work that mothers do. This approach identifies mothers through what they do, rather than how they feel. Mothers share a set of activities known as "maternal practice", that are universal, even though they vary as individuals and across cultures. These activities include nurturing, protecting, and training their children. An individual's mothering actions are shaped by their beliefs about family, individuality, the nature of childhood, and the nature of their child. These are also often shaped by their own childhood and past experiences with children. The dynamic interactions between the mother and child create deep and meaningful connections.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

====Particularistic approach====
The particularistic approach to mothering suggests that the role of a mother, their activities, and understandings cannot be separated from the context in which they live. According to this theory, mothering takes place within "''specific historical contexts framed by interlocking structures of race, class, and gender'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Patricia Hill|editor1-last=Bassin|editor1-first=Donna|editor2-last=Honey|editor2-first=Margaret|editor3-last=Kaplan|editor3-first=Meryle Mahrer|editor1-link=Representations of Motherhood|title=Shifting the Center: Race, Class, and Feminist Theorizing About Motherhood|date=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068638|pages=56–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a mother's strategies and meanings that she develops are influenced by different social locations, such as the intersections of regional and local political economy with class, ethnicity, culture, and sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

===Conventional notions of motherhood===
Motherhood ideology is influenced by the idealization of the family structure and perpetuates the image of a heterosexual couple with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorne|first1=Barrie|editor1-last=Thorne|editor1-first=Barrie|editor2-last=Yalom|editor2-first=Marilyn|title=Rethinking the Family: Some Feminist Questions|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=0582282659|pages=3–30|edition=2nd|chapter=Feminism and the family: Two decades of thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists refer to this as the "[[bourgeois]] family", which arose out of typical 16th- and 17th-century European households and is often considered the "traditional Western" structure. In this family model the father acts as the economic support and sometimes disciplinarian of the family, while the [[mother]] or other female relative oversees most of the child-rearing.

In [[East Asia]]n and [[Western world|Western]] traditional families, fathers were the heads of the families, which meant that his duties included providing financial support and making critical decisions, some of which must have been obeyed without question by the rest of the family members.  "Some Asian American men are brought up under stringent gender role expectations such as a focus on group harmony and filial piety, carrying on their family name and conforming to the expectations of the parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=William M.|url=https://umdrive.memphis.edu/slease/public/ResearchTeam/ResearchReadings/Liu.pdf|title=Exploring the Lives of Asian American Men: Racial Identity, Male Role Norms, Gender Role Conflicts, and Prejudicial Attitudes|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=3|number=2|pages=107–118|year=2002|doi=10.1037/1524-9220.3.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother's role in the family is celebrated on [[Mother's Day]]. [[Anna Reeves Jarvis]] was a woman who originally organized Mother's Work Day's protesting the lack of cleanliness and sanitation in the work place.&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2217890/|title=Soap to ploughshares: How to return Mother's Day to its original meaning|work=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=West Virginia State Archives|url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiSTory/jarvis.html|title=Ann Maria Reeves Jarvis|work=WVA&amp;H West Virginia Archives &amp; History|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|year=2009|accessdate=25 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921030946/http://www.wvculture.org/history/jarvis.html|archivedate=21 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis died in 1905 and her daughter created a National Mother's Day to honor her mother.&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt; Mothers frequently have a very important role in raising offspring and the title can be given to a non-biological mother that fills this role. This is common in [[stepfamily|stepmothers]].

===Deviancy discourses===
There are many cultural contradictions and diverse arrangements and practices that challenge the intensive mothering ideology. However, they are considered deviant discourses since they do not conform to the script of full-time motherhood in the context of marriage. These include single mothers, welfare mothers, minority mothers, immigrant mothers, and lesbian mothers. These types of motherhood categories are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt; Furthermore, women who cannot or choose not to be mothers deal with many internal and external pressures.&lt;ref name="The Motherhood Mandate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russo|first1=Nancy Felipe|date=1976|title=The Motherhood Mandate|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=32|issue=3|pages=143–153|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1976.tb02603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood Statistics===
In the United States, 82.5 million women are mothers of all ages, while the national average age of first child births is 25.1 years.  In 2008, 10% of births were to [[teenage pregnancy|teenage girls]], and 14% were to women ages 35 and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Gretchen|last2=D'vera|first2=John|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1586/changing-demographic-characteristics-american-mothers|title=The New Demography of American Motherhood|publisher=Pew Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a study found that the average woman spends 5 years working and building a career before having children, and mothers working non-salary jobs began having children at age 27, compared to mothers with salary positions, who became pregnant at age 31.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goudreau|first=Jenna|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/family-career-working-mother-forbes-woman-time-best-age-to-have-children_2.html|title=When Should You Become a Mom|work=Forbes|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124045821/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/family-career-working-mother-forbes-woman-time-best-age-to-have-children_2.html|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study shows that the difference in age of child birth is related to education, since the longer a woman has been in school, the older she will be when she enters the workforce.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; 

==Sociology of fatherhood==
[[File:Vater mit Toechtern 03.jpg|thumb|Father with his two daughters in relationship]]
According to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], a critical novelty in human society, compared to humans' closest biological relatives ([[chimpanzees]] and [[bonobos]]), is the parental role assumed by the males, which were unaware of their "father" connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maurice|last=Godelier|authorlink=Maurice Godelier|title=Métamorphoses de la parenté|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goody|first=Jack|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=The Labyrinth of Kinship |publisher=New Left Review |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, especially traditional western, a father is usually the husband in a [[Marriage|married couple]]. Many times fathers have a very important role in raising offspring and the title can be given to a non-biological father that fills this role. This is common in [[stepfamily|stepfathers]] (males married to biological mothers).
In [[East Asia]]n and [[Western world|Western]] traditional families, fathers are the heads of the families, which means that their duties include providing financial support and making critical decisions, some of which must be obeyed without question by the rest of the family members.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As with cultural concepts of family, the specifics of a father's role vary according to cultural [[Folkways (sociology)|folkways]]. In what some sociologists term the "[[bourgeois]] family", which arose out of typical 16th- and 17th-century European households, the father's role has been somewhat limited. In this family model the father acts as the economic support and sometimes disciplinarian of the family, while the [[mother]] or other female relative oversees most of the child-rearing. This structure is enforced, for example, in societies which legislate "[[maternity leave]]" but do not have a corresponding "[[paternity leave]]".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, this limited role has increasingly been called into question. Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bjørnholt | first1 = M. | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | last2 = | first2 = | year =2014 | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | url = http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295–315 | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science of parenting===
Described as 'the science of male parenting', the study of 'father craft' emerged principally in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the United States (but also throughout [[Europe]]) in the 1920s. "Male adjuncts to [[Maternity]] and Infant Welfare Centers – reacted to the maternal dominance in infant welfare and parenting in interwar Britain by arguing that fathers should play a crucial role in the upbringing of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Tim|doi=10.1111/j.0953-5233.2006.00388.x|title=Fatherhood and the British Fathercraft Movement, 1919-39|journal=Gender &amp; History|date=6 March 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were such a study to be conducted into the science of female parenting, it would be called mother craft.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The words 'ma ma' and 'mom', usually regarded as [[terms of endearment]] directed towards a mother figure, are generally one of the first words a child speaks. While 'da da' or 'dad' often precede it, this does not reflect a stronger bond between the father and child than that of the mother and child, it is merely simpler to pronounce than 'mummy' or 'mum' which require greater control over the mouth muscles.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Children tend to remember 'daddy' more because, according to research, they are more exciting to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golinkoff|first=Roberta|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=54595|title=Baby Talk: Communicating with your child|date=2 October 2003|publisher=MedicineNet|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary theories===
A number of studies have been given to the American public to determine how men view and define [[fatherhood]]. Specifically, studies have focused on why men choose to become fathers and the relationship between fatherhood and contemporary [[masculinity]]. Not surprisingly, recent research on fatherhood is framed by [[Social identity theory|identity theory]] and has focused on the salience, centrality, and importance of the father identity in men's lives, especially as it may be linked to men's involvement with their children. According to identity theory, the more salient and central the identity, the more likely individuals are to engage in behaviors associated with it. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] refers to the readiness to act out an identity in a particular situation. [[Centrality]] refers to the importance of an identity in relation to other identities. The centrality of the father identity is usually held at a higher level (as opposed to brother, husband, etc.) due to the gendered expectation that men must be "good" fathers. Men who view their role as a father central and crucial to who they are as a person are more likely to engage with their children and strive to participate in [[responsible fatherhood]]. Men who fail to successfully become fathers or are unable to have children view the lack of fatherhood as a threat to their masculinity. As a result, the threat to masculinity serves as a driving force for men to possibly become fathers because they never want to be seen as infertile or effeminate.&lt;ref name=Stryker1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stryker|first1=S.|last2=Serpe|first2=R.T.|year=1994|title=Identity salience and psychological centrality: Equivalent, overlapping, or complementary concepts? |journal=Social Psychological Quarterly|volume=57|pages=16–35|doi=10.2307/2786972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men who do not choose fatherhood===
Studies on men who choose not to be fathers often focus on how the role of fatherhood is crucial to masculinity and a man's central identity. Many men blame economic difficulties, cultural differences, and life situations as potential factors that deter them from fatherhood.&lt;ref name=Stryker1994/&gt;

Economic difficulties, see [[economic problem]], serve as a primary explanation for men to avoid fatherhood. For men, it is difficult to separate occupational success from fatherhood because financially providing for one's family has been central to the identity of being a father in the United States. As a result, a complex relationship is formed between economic struggles and the importance of fatherhood. Men who are not employed or have low earnings often feel as if they have failed as both fathers and men. On the other hand, men who have a low socioeconomic status find fatherhood very appealing because it gives them a measure of accomplishment denied to them by the occupational world.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In terms of the cultural importance of fatherhood, white men and men of color have differing views on fatherhood that can affect how many of these men participate in fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=N.|year=2002|title=The package deal: Marriage, work, and fatherhood in men's lives|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Temple University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, some men blame life situations as the primary factor for their decision not to pursue fatherhood. Life situations are defined as an individual's relationship status (single or married) and their age. Studies have shown that men who are older and married tend to be more likely to pursue fatherhood. It has been proposed that men continue to view [[marriage]], work and fatherhood as a "package deal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=Veronica|first2=Julia|last2=Mcquillan|first3=Arthur L.|last3=Greil|first4=Raleigh|last4=Contreras|first5=Karina M.|last5=Shreffler|title=The Importance of Fatherhood to U.S. Married and Cohabiting Men|journal=Fathering: A Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice About Men As Fathers|volume=9|number=3|year=2011|pages=232–251|doi=10.3149/fth.0903.232}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that lacking one of these components, like work or marriage, may result in the decision not to have children.

It has also been proposed that married men feel as if they are expected to pursue fatherhood as a part of their marriage though they personally may not want to have children. On the other hand, men who are single and younger do not feel the same desire because they are not "prepared" to emotionally and financially support a child.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Alternate family forms==

The number of [[married couples]] raising children has decreased over the years. In Canada, married and [[common law]] couples with children under the age of 25 represented 44% of all families in 2001.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; This statistic has lowered since 1991, when married and common law couples raising children under the age of 25 represented 49 percent of all Canadian families.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; There are various family forms which are becoming increasingly popular in society.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===One-parent families===
In Canada, one parent families have become popular since 1961 when only 8.4 percent of children were being raised by a single parent.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; In 2001, 15.6 percent of children were being raised by  a single parent.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;  The number of single parent families continue to rise, while it is four times more likely that the mother is the parent raising the child. The high percentage of mothers becoming the sole parent is sometimes due to the result of a divorce, unplanned pregnancy or the inability to find a befitting partner.
Children who are raised by a single parent are commonly at a disadvantage due to the characteristics of parenting. A mother and father both make significant contributions to the development of a child, therefore one parent's ability to raise a child on her or his own may be hindered.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Cohabitation===
A residence containing an unmarried couple is called [[cohabitation]]. This type of family style is becoming increasingly accepted in Canada and has increased from 8% in 1981 to 16.4% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; In Sweden and Nordic communities, this family form is quite common, with or without the inclusion of children. However, in various Catholic regions such as Italy, this is uncommon due to the religious aspects (See [[Catholic marriage]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Gay and lesbian couples===
Gay and Lesbian couples are categorized as same sex relationships. In 1989, Denmark was the first nation to allow same sex couples to get married and to provide equal rights to all citizens.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; After this many nations began to allow same sex marriages to occur such as Canada and Spain (2005).&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; A United States Supreme Court ruling mandated that same sex marriage is constituational and therefore allowed in all 50 states in the United States (2015).

===Child-rearing by same-sex couples===
Children of same-sex couples either come from past relationships or through other opportunities like adoption or artificial insemination.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} From the data collected in the 2000 U.S. Census, it was suggested that more than 250,000 children in the United States were being raised by lesbian and gay couples.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 2010 U.S. Census, it was reported that 20% of lesbian and gay couple or partnership households are raising children (115,064 out of 594,000 same-sex households). The trend of child-rearing amongst gay and lesbian couples or partnerships is on the rise. Also, the support from the general public for gay and lesbian couples or partnerships to raising children is at its all-time high since the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1994, the idea of homosexual partnerships parenting children evenly divided Americans for support. When Americans were asked, "Do you think homosexual couples should or should not have the legal right to adopt a child", 28% of Americans said they should, and 65% said they shouldn't.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 2003, the idea of homosexual partnerships parenting children evenly divided Americans for support. When Americans were asked the same question about the right of homosexual partnerships to raise children through adoption, 49% of Americans said they should, and 48% said they shouldn't.  In 2014, Americans were asked a very similar question. The results were almost more polarizing than the results found in 1994. Twenty years later, 63% of Americans said lesbian and gay couples or partnerships, and 35% said they shouldn't.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are no federal laws prohibiting the adoption of a child by a homosexual couple or partnership.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} But there are some states, one being Florida, that depend on the opinions of the county judge in charge of the case, and county judges base their decisions on "the best interest of the child", in regards to child adoption by same-sex couple.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The "best interest of the child" seems to be the driving force behind the push back and reasoning for the remaining lack of support for homosexual couples or partnerships adopting or raising children. The central argument in the debate for legal rights, policies and overall support is related to the idea of same-sex couples raising children is the well-being of children raised in those families. There are concerns like about the mental, emotional and even the social development of children who are raised in same sex couple or partnership households. There has been a plethora of research conducted that provides insight into a range of issues, including the personal development, gender development, peer relationships, and family relationships of children with same-sex parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Research suggests that sexual identities (including gender identity, gender-role behavior, and sexual orientation) develop in much the same ways among children of lesbian mothers as they do among children of heterosexual parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Evidence also suggests that children of lesbian and gay parents have normal social relationships with peers and adults.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} There have also been studies of other aspects of personal development (including personality, self-concept, and conduct) that similarly reveal few differences between children of lesbian mothers and children of heterosexual parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These differences are not significant but are noticeable. For example, there was a study that examined and compared particular behaviors and ideas/belief performed by sons and daughters of lesbian mothers. Studies found that 53% of the daughters of lesbian mothers aspired to pursue careers as physicians, attorneys, and engineers compared with only 21% of the daughters of heterosexual mothers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The sons of lesbian mothers also tended to be less aggressive and more nurturing than the sons of heterosexual mothers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  The general concern about homosexual couples or partnerships parenting children doesn't have any grounds for their argument, "children who grow up with one or two gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive, social, and sexual functioning as do children whose parents are heterosexual. Children's optimal development seems to be influenced more by the nature of the relationships and interactions within the family unit than by the particular structural form it takes."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Chosen or fictive kin===
{{main|fictive kin}}
Others who are not related by blood or marriage are variously called fictive kin, chosen kin, or voluntary kin.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=pHcADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of childhood==
The values learned during childhood are important in the development and socialization of children. The family is considered to be the agency of [[primary socialisation]] and the first [[focal socialisation agency]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===History===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
In the last two or three decades, the sociology of childhood has gained increasing attention and triggered numerous empirical studies as well as intensive theoretical disputes, starting in the Scandinavian and the English-speaking countries. Up to this time, sociology had approached children and childhood mainly from a socialization perspective, and the emergence of the new childhood sociological paradigm ran parallel to the feminist critique of sociological traditions. Childhood sociologists attacked the "adultocentric" approach and the "separative view" of sociology towards children. Not surprisingly, then, the key works in the sociology of childhood are quite interdisciplinary, linking [[history]], [[cultural studies]], [[ethnomethodology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Key texts include James and Prout's ''Constructing and Reconstructing Childhood'' (1990/1997), James, Jenks and Prout ''Theorizing Childhood'' (1998)and Prout's ''The Future of Childhood'' (2005). On methodological issues in research with children see ''Research with Children'', edited by Christensen and James (2008).

===Recent trends===
The current Sociology of childhood is organized around three central discussions:

'''The child as a social actor''': This approach derives from youth sociology as well as ethnography. Focusing on everyday life and the ways children orient themselves in society, it engages with the cultural performances and the social worlds they construct and take part in. Theory and research methodology approach children as active participants and members of society right from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Mackay1975"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mackay |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Mackay (sociologist) |year=1975 |chapter=Conceptions of children and models of socialization |editor=R.

Therefore, the sociology of childhood distinguishes itself from the established concepts of [[socialisation]]&lt;ref name="Cromdal2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cromdal |first=Jakob |authorlink=Jakob Cromdal |year=2006 |chapter=Socialization |editor=K. Brown |title=Encyclopedia of language and linguistics |location=North-Holland |publisher=Elsevier |pages=462–66 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/00353-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; research and [[developmental psychology]] of the last decades.

'''The generational order''': The second approach centers on socio-structural and socio-theoretical questions concerning [[social equality]] and [[social order]] in a society, which categorizes their members by age and segregates them in many respects (rights, deeds, economical participation, ascribed needs etc.). These issues can be summarized under the overall concept of the '''generational order'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Conceptualising-Child-Adult-Relations/Alanen-Mayall/p/book/9780415231596|title=Conceptualising Child-Adult Relations (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the categorization of societal members by age is far from being an innocent representation of natural distinctions, but rather a social construction of such a "natural truth". It is, therefore, a relevant component of [[social order]] and deeply connected to other dimensions of social inequality.
Social and economic changes and socio-political interventions thus become central topics in childhood sociology. The analysis of these issues has increased awareness of the generational inequality of societies.

'''The Hybridity of Childhood''': This discussion is more critical (though not dismissive) of the social constructionist approaches that have dominated the sociology of childhood since the 1990s. More open to materialist perspectives, it seeks an interdisciplinary path that recognizes the biological as well as the social and cultural shaping of childhood and holds open the possibility of an interdisciplinary Childhood Studies emergent from current multi-disciplinary efforts. This scholarship has two important influences. Firstly, a so-called 'new wave' of childhood studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=K. W.|date=2011-12-20|title=The new wave of childhood studies: Breaking the grip of bio-social dualism?|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0907568211427612|journal=Childhood|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=439–452|doi=10.1177/0907568211427612}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavily influenced by Alan Prout's (2005) seminal book ''The Future of Childhood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Future-of-Childhood/Prout/p/book/9780415256759|title=The Future of Childhood (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Prout examines how childhoods are not merely constructed socially – via discourses, laws or institutions – but materially, through toys, food and medicines. Since then, sociologists such as Nick Lee have offered important analyses of the ways in which the 'entanglements' between children and non-human materialities and technologies have become ever-more important to the governance and regulation of children's lives, through what he terms the 'biopoliticisation' of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=N.|last2=Motzkau|first2=J.|date=2011-01-13|title=Navigating the bio-politics of childhood|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0907568210371526|journal=Childhood|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=7–19|doi=10.1177/0907568210371526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, nonrepresentational approaches to [[Children's geographies]] have offered a commensurate and (arguably) broader series of approaches that move beyond social constructivism. Scholars such as Peter Kraftl, John Horton and Affrica Taylor have been particularly influential in examining how childhoods are produced and experienced through complex intersections of emotion, affect, embodiment and materiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-11-01|title=Beyond 'voice', beyond 'agency', beyond 'politics'?

Nevertheless, during the mid-2010s, a so-called 'spatial turn' in childhood and education studies saw increasing cross-fertilisation between these fields and the take-up of children's geographers' work by sociologists and others. Therefore, the prospects for cross-disciplinary scholarship around hybridity, spatiality and a 'new wave' remain very promising – perhaps most evident in a recent volume by Julie Seymour, Abigail Hackett and Lisa Procter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137464972|title=Children's Spatialities - Embodiment, Emotion and {{!}} Julie Seymour {{!}} Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and childhood===

There has been much research and discussion about the effects of society on the assumption of gender roles in childhood, and how societal norms perpetuate gender-differentiated interactions with children. [[Psychologist]]s and [[sociology|sociologists]] suggest that [[gender identity|self-gender identity]] is a result of social learning from peers, [[role model]]ing within the family unit, and genetic predisposition.&lt;ref name="Raley"&gt;Raley, S., &amp; Bianchi S. (2006). Sons, Daughters, And Family Processes: Does Gender Of Children Matter? Annual Review of Sociology, 32(1), 401-21&lt;/ref&gt; The sociological implications are as follows:

'''Peer interactions''':

There are significant gender differences in the relationship styles among children which particularly begin to emerge after early childhood and at the onset of middle childhood around age 6 and grow more prevalent with age. Boys tend to play in larger groups than girls, and friends of boys are more likely to become friends with each other which, in turn leads to more density in social networks among boys. Boys also have more well-defined dominance hierarchies than girls within their peer groups. In terms of [[dyad (sociology)|dyadic relationships]], girls are more likely to have longer-lasting relationships of this nature, but no literature suggests that girls engage in more dyadic relationships than boys. Girls are also more [[prosocial behavior|prosocial]] in conflict situations and are better at collaborative work and play than boys. They also spend more time in social conversations than boys and are more likely to [[self-disclosure|self-disclose]] among their peers than boys. On the other hand, boys are more likely than girls to engage in organized play such as sports and activities with well-defined rules. One theory suggests that because of this, boys have more opportunities to exhibit their strength and skill and compare theirs to that of their peers during these competitive activities. Girls' peer groups are characterized by strong interpersonal relations, empathy for others, and working towards connection-oriented goals, while boys focus more on asserting their own [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] in the peer group and agenda-oriented goals.&lt;ref name="Rose"/&gt;

Significant social differences also exist between boys and girls when experiencing and dealing with social stress. Boys experience more social stress among their peers than girls in the form of verbal and physical abuse, but girls experience more social stress through strains in their friendships and social networks. To deal with social stress, girls do more support-seeking, express more emotions to their friends, and [[rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] more than boys. Boys use humor as a distraction from stress and seek less emotional support within their friendships and social networks.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Rose, Amanda J.; Rudolph, Karen D. (2006). "A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys".Psychological Bulletin, 132(1), 98-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family interactions''':

Overall, the literature implies that the biological gender of children affects how parents interact with them. Differentials in interaction range from the amount of time spent with children to how much parents invest financially in their children's futures. On average, [[father]]s tend to exhibit more differential treatment than [[mother]]s, and fathers tend to be more invested in families with sons than families with daughters in terms of both time and money. However, the association of gender with father investment has been weakening over the years, and the differentials are not large. Parents tend to enroll their daughters in more cultural activities than their sons (e.g. art classes, dance classes, and musical instrument lessons), and tend to be more invested in school-related parent involvement programs for their sons than their daughters.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

Sons and daughters are not only treated differently by their parents based on gender, but also receive different benefits from their parents based on gender. Parents, both fathers and mothers, may be less invested in their daughters' higher education than their sons' and tend to save more money on average in anticipation for their sons' enrollment in educational institutions after high school graduation. However, this may not lead to more academic or work success for sons later in life. Parents are also more likely to underestimate daughters' abilities in math and science while overestimating that of sons. Daughters also, on average, also do more housework than sons, which reflects [[occupational sexism|gendered divisions in the workplace]] and household in society.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

[[sibling|Sibling relations]], unlike parental relations, show no consensus in the literature about being gender-differentiated in interactions and benefits. However, sex-minority siblings may have more difficulty receiving necessary sex-specific treatment from parents.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

Questions about socialization practices and institutions remain central in childhood research. But, they are being dealt with in a new, more sociological way. To analyze socialization processes means, therefore, to reconstruct the historically and culturally varying conceptions, processes and institutions of [[discipline|disciplining]] and [[civilization]] of the offspring. In addition, the strategies of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] formation and the practices of [[Social status|status]] (re-)production are considered. The sociology of social inequality and the sociology of the family and private life are, therefore, important fields for childhood sociologists. Children's own action, their resistance, cooperation, and collective action among [[peer group|peers]] has to be taken into account. Meanwhile, widespread anthropological assumptions concerning a universal human nature, based on a view of individual and society as opposed to each other, should be omitted from the conceptual repertoire of sociological [[childhood research]]. They are the legacy of the older socialization approach and they legitimate some forms of childhood and education practices as indispensable and even as a "natural" requirement of society, while devaluing others. In this way they generally legitimate western [[middle class]] childhood and mask [[Social inequality|inequality]] and the interests of [[social order]].

The '''Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism''' is a research institute at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism|url=http://www.shoahlegacy.org/org/stephen-roth-institute-study-contemporary-anti-semitism-and-racism|publisher=[[European Shoah Legacy Institute]]|accessdate=25 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061955/http://www.shoahlegacy.org/org/stephen-roth-institute-study-contemporary-anti-semitism-and-racism|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is a resource for information, provides a forum for academic discussion, and fosters research on issues concerning [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Racism|racist]] theories and manifestations. The Institute's principal focus is the social and political exploitation of these phenomena in the period since the end of [[World War II]], and the influence of their historical background.

==Details==
The Institute was founded as the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism in the fall of 1991, and was headed by Prof. Dina Porat of Tel Aviv University until 2010. Since then, Dr. Scott Ury of Tel Aviv University's Department of Jewish History has been Director of the Roth Institute. The Institute is situated within Tel Aviv University's Faculty of the Humanities and is associated with the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Nazi Era and the Holocaust]] in Tel Aviv, home of one of the world's richest collections of documents related to [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes and movements, and antisemitism. The Institute welcomes visitors and fosters cooperation with universities and research institutes outside Israel.

==Activities==
The institute's activities are:&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Roth Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Structural Genomics Consortium''' ('''SGC''') is a not-for-profit organization formed in 2004 to determine the three-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s of medical relevance, and place them in the [[Protein Data Bank]] without restriction on use. The SGC operates out of the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Toronto|Toronto]]. Over the past five years, the SGC has accounted for ~25% of the global output of novel human protein structures each year, and ~40% of the annual global output of structures of proteins from human parasites.  The SGC target proteins have relevance to human health and disease, such as [[diabetes]], [[cancer]] and infectious diseases such as [[malaria]].

The SGC is an 'open data' partnership. All research results are published with no restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perkmann Markus, Schildt Henri | year = 2015 | title = Open Data Partnerships between Firms and Universities: The Role of Boundary Organizations | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733314002248/ | journal = Research Policy | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1133–1143 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2014.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SGC is also spearheading an "open access" chemistry partnership&amp;nbsp;– a new model for pre-competitive drug discovery in which the public and private sectors collaborate to generate potent and selective pharmacological inhibitors of human proteins that regulate epigenetic signalling, and commit to make these reagents available without restriction on use.

In 2011, the SGC launched a project to create high-quality recombinant antibodies to proteins implicated in epigenetic events in an effort to stimulate research on these proteins. The project is carried out in partnership with leading academic research groups in the field (Tony Kossiakoff and Shohei Koide at University of Chicago, Sachdev Sidhu at the University of Toronto) and the laboratory of Jack Greenblatt at the University of Toronto. These reagents will be made available without restriction on use.

The SGC is headed by [[Aled Edwards]] (CEO/Director). Operations at each site are managed by a Chief Scientist&amp;nbsp;– [[Cheryl Arrowsmith]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]] and Chas Bountra in [[Oxford]], [[UK]].

; "Discovery of a Selective, Substrate Competitive Inhibitor of the Lysine Methyltransferase SETD8"
: To date, SETD8 is the only methyltransferase that induces monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), which is involved with the regulation of biological processes such as DNA damage response.  SETD8 also monomethylates [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA) and promotes [[carcinogenesis]], but inhibitors are virtually unknown besides nahuoic acid A.  In result of this study, the first substrate-competitive inhibitor was found (UNC0379).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=A|title=Discovery of a Selective, Substrate-Competitive Inhibitor of the Lysine Methyltransferase SETD8|journal=J Med Chem|volume=57|issue=15|pages=6822–6833|pmid=25032507|doi=10.1021/jm500871s|date=Aug 2014|pmc=4136711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Copper is required for oncogenic BRAF signalling and tumorigenesis": When the [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] kinase is mutated, it induces an active state of cancer (e.g. melanomas, thyroid cancer, etc.).  The study found that when Copper Transporter 1 (CTR1) levels are decreased, the BRAF-related signaling and tumorigenesis levels decrease, also.  Next, when human cells are transformed by BRAF or resistant to its inhibition, copper chelators used to treat [[Wilson's disease]] can help lessen tumor growth.  When combined, the results of this study indicate that copper [[chelation therapy]] could be a very strong candidate for treating cancers related to any BRAF mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brady|first1=DC|title=Copper is required for oncogenic BRAF signalling and tumorigenesis|journal=Nature|volume=509|issue=7501|pages=492–496|pmid=24717435|doi=10.1038/nature13180|date=May 2014|pmc=4138975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "LRIG2 mutations cause urofacial syndrome": [[Urofacial syndrome]] (UFS) is linked with a major risk of kidney failure and unique facial expression when crying, smiling, or laughing.  Those afflicted with UFS have a mutated LRIG2, which is a protein that is heavily involved with tumorigenesis and neural cell signaling.  Previous studies showed that UFS can also be caused by mutations in encoding [[heparanase]]-2 (HPSE2), and after studying nerve fascicles within muscle bundles in the human fetal bladder, it is confirmed that both are involved in the neural development of the urinary tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=HM|title=LRIG2 mutations cause urofacial syndrome|journal=Am J Hum Genet|date=2013|volume=92|issue=2|pages=259–264|pmid=23313374|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.12.002|pmc=3567269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Human-Chromatin-Related Protein Interactions Identify a Demethylase Complex Required for Chromosome Segregation": The study resulted in a comprehensive protein-protein interaction map (chromatin-related) while also identifying 164 chromatin-modifying complexes.  Also, they found that KDM8 and RCCD1 form a histone [[demethylase]] complex, which plays a very big role in the chromosome's stability and division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edyta|first1=Marcon|title=Human-Chromatin-Related Protein Interactions Identify a Demethylase Complex Required for Chromosome Segregation|journal=Cell Reports|date=26 June 2014|volume=8|issue=1|pages=297–310|url=http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(14)00444-6?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124714004446%3Fshowall%3Dtrue|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.05.050|pmid=24981860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Protein Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 Conjugation Delays but Does Not Overcome Coronavirus Proliferation in a Model of Fulminant Hepatitis": The study revolved around the pathway in the human immune system dealing with a [[coronavirus]] diagnosis.  The results had a great indication of the ISG15 pathway being of great significance.  Though there are likely numerous pathways or targets, the study provided great insight into the subject, nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Xue-Zhong|title=Protein Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 Conjugation Delays but Does Not Overcome Coronavirus Proliferation in a Model of Fulminant Hepatitis|journal=Journal of Virology|date=19 March 2014|volume=88|issue=11|pages=6195–6204|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/88/11/6195|accessdate=17 November 2014|doi=10.1128/jvi.03801-13|pmid=24648452|pmc=4093886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Structural Basis for Histone Mimicry and Hijacking of Host Proteins by Influenza Virus Protein NS1": Diseases can arise from pathogens that mimic host proteins.  The NS1 protein that is involved with [[influenza A]] that is well known for using mimicry to compete with host proteins.  The study concluded that the mimicry was imperfect in its copying, but it still must have underlying involvement with influenza A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qin|first1=Su|title=Structural Basis for Histone Mimicry and Hijacking of Host Proteins by Influenza Virus Protein NS1|journal=Nature Communications|date=21 December 2013|volume=5|issue=3952|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140523/ncomms4952/full/ncomms4952.html|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1038/ncomms4952|pmid=24853335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study concluded that the mutations that causes this disease leads to prolactin insensitivity and in turn a germline familial hyperprolactinemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newey|first1=Paul|title=Mutant Prolactin Receptor and Familial Hyperprolactinemia|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=21 November 2013|pages=2012–2020|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1307557|accessdate=16 November 2014|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1307557|volume=369|pmc=4209110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Why is Epigenetics Important in Understanding the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Musculoskeletal Diseases?": The publication went over the underlying effects [[epigenetics]] has on the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal diseases.  It mostly went over how the epigenetic machinery is extremely important in homeostasis and natural development.  The overview went over the therapeutic medicine relevant to [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and its development.  The researchers extend this claim by saying there are epigenetic implications with other autoimmune diseases and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oppermann|first1=Udo|title=Why Epigenetics Important in Understanding the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Musculoskeletal Diseases?|journal=[[Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy]]|date=3 April 2013|volume=15|issue=209|doi=10.1186/ar4186|url=http://arthritis-research.com/content/15/2/209|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Adriaen van Ostade]]. ''Selfportrait.'' 1663. [[Gemäldegalerie]].]]

A '''studio''' is an [[artist]] or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose of [[acting]], [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[pottery]] ([[ceramic]]s), [[sculpture]], [[origami]], [[woodworking]], [[scrapbooking]], [[photography]], [[graphic design]], [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[industrial design]], [[radio]] or [[television production]] [[broadcasting]] or the making of [[music]]. The term is also used for the workroom of [[dancer]]s, often specified to [[dance studio]].

The word ''studio'' is derived from the {{Lang-it|studio}}, from {{Lang-lat|studium}}, from ''studere'', meaning to [[Wiktionary:study|study]] or zeal.

The French term for studio, '''[[atelier]]''', in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]].

''Studio'' is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. 

==Art studio==
[[File:Jane Frank Portrait .jpg|thumb|Artist [[Jane Frank]] in her studio, 1960s or 1970s. The studio of a contemporary [[mixed media]] artist can be quite a messy affair.]]

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the [[workshop]] of..." or "studio of..."
An art studio is sometimes called an '''atelier''', especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, "atelier" can also refer to the [[Atelier Method]], a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. 

The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Michael (2010). ''Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting'', p.20. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-3408-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational studio==
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design.  In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.  Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism. A great take on this latter type of "studio classroom" is [http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html described by Carleton University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is studio teaching?|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery studio==
[[Pottery|Studio pottery]] is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

==Production studios==
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the [[arts]]; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and [[television production]] studio is the place where programs and [[radio commercial]] and [[television advertising]] are recorded for further emission.

===Animation studio===
[[Animation studio]]s, like [[movie studio]]s, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[anime]], they continue the tradition of a studio where a [[Master tradesman|master]] or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] and [[Pixar]].

===Comics studio===
Artists or writers, predominantly those producing [[comics]], still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a [[comic strip]], [[comic book]] or [[graphic novel]].  In the early days of [[Dan Dare]], [[Frank Hampson]] employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip.  [[Eddie Campbell]] is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

==Instructional studio==
[[File:Student using Laptop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Student using a laptop in an instructional studio.]]
Many [[University|universities]] are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the [[SCALE-UP]] (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at [[NC State]].

===Mastering studio===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in [[audio mastering]]. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In [[video production]], a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the [[post-production]] of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: [[video editing]], [[colour grading]] correction, mixing, [[DVD authoring]] and [[audio mastering]]. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

===Acting studio===

An "acting studio" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Actors Studio]] are legendary acting studios in New York.

===Movie studio===
{{Main|Movie studio}}

A '''movie studio''' is a [[company (law)|company]] which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for [[filmmaking]].  This environment may be interior ([[sound stage]]), exterior ([[backlot]]) or both.

===Photographic studio===
{{Main|Photographic studio}}

A photographic studio is both a workspace and a [[corporation|corporate]] body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

===Radio studio===
{{Main|Radio studio}}

A radio studio is a room in which a [[Radio programming|radio program]] or show is produced, either for live [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or for recording for a later broadcast.  The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

===Recording studio===
{{Main|Recording studio}}

A recording studio is a facility for [[sound recording]] which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good [[acoustics]] and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

===Television studio===
{{Main|Television studio}}

A television studio is an installation in which television or [[video production]]s take place, for [[live television]], for recording [[video tape]], or for the acquisition of raw [[footage]] for [[post-production]]. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, [[movie studio]]s, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

==Yoga and martial arts studios==
Many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are "studied" in a studio.  It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios.  These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.
