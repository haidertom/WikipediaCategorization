'''''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''''', also known as '''''A.I.''''', is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], co-written by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], and based on the 1969 short story "[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. It was co-produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Bonnie Curtis]], and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.

Development of ''A.I.'' originally began with producer-director [[Stanley Kubrick]], after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in protracted [[development (film)|development]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay.

''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' divided critics, with the overall balance being positive, and grossed approximately $235 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (by [[John Williams]]). In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, the film was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=31 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In the late 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]], and [[New York City|New York]] and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thought and emotion, have been created.

David, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin, after contracting a rare disease, has been placed in [[suspended animation]] and not expected to recover. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that belonged to Martin.

Martin is cured of his disease and brought home. As he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He tricks David into entering the parents's bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of Monica's hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears David intended to injure them.

At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating David's self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. Instead, she abandons David and Teddy in the forest. She warns David to avoid all humans, and tells him to find other unregistered Mecha who can protect him.

David is captured for an anti-Mecha "Flesh Fair", where obsolete, unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is placed on a platform with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. Before the pair can be destroyed with acid, the crowd, thinking David is a real boy, begins booing and throwing things at the show's emcee. In the chaos, David and Joe escape. They set out to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]], whom David remembers from ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and who David believes can turn him into a real boy, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.

Joe and David make their way to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]]. There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. He then meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David. David finds more copies of him, as well as female versions called Darlene, that have been made there.

Disheartened, David lets himself fall from a ledge of the building. He is rescued by Joe, flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater, and wants to go down to meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities, who snare him with an [[electromagnet]]. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to dive down to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue at the now-sunken [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. David repeatedly asks the Fairy to turn him into a real boy. Eventually the ocean freezes and David's power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humans are extinct, and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced silicon-based form called Specialists. They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans, making them special.

The Specialists revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David's memories to reconstruct the Swinton home. David asks the Specialists if they can make him human, but they cannot. However, he insists they recreate Monica from [[DNA]] from the lock of her hair, which Teddy has kept. The Mecha warn David that the clone can live for only a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.

==Production==

===Development===
Kubrick began development on an adaptation of "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a [[film treatment]]. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Scott Brake |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |title=Spielberg Talks About the Genesis of ''A.I.'' |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N3Xvgw8?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to co-finance ''A.I.'' and cover distribution duties.&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]], and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.&lt;ref name=connect&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steven Gaydos |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |title=The Kubrick Connection |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N47xlcn?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Shaw]] briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' for inspiration, calling ''A.I.'' "a [[picaresque]] robot version of ''[[Pinocchio]]''".&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Dana Haris |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |title=Spielberg lines up ''A.I.'', ''Report'' |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N4NHRKf?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on ''A.I.'' in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the [[toyetic|kiddie market]]."&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped ''A.I.'' to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', feeling [[computer animation]] was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of ''A.I.'' would begin in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Christian Moerk |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |title=''A.I.'' next for Kubrick at Warners |date=November 2, 1993 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N6Bv8HO?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Muren]] and Ned Gorman, who worked on ''Jurassic Park'', became [[visual effects supervisor]]s,&lt;ref name=connect/&gt; but Kubrick was displeased with their [[previsualization]], and with the expense of hiring [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in [[pre-production]] with [[Christopher "Fangorn" Baker]] as [[concept art]]ist, and [[Sara Maitland]] assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus".&lt;ref name=Ian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-03 |title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-18 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cunningham]] became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for ''A.I.'' can be seen on the DVD, ''[[The Work of Director Chris Cunningham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature by Matt Bailey |url=http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719222500/http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=notcoming.com &amp;#124; The Work of Director Chris Cunningham |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had [[Joseph Mazzello]] do a [[screen test]] for the lead role.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Cunningham helped assemble a series of "little robot-type humans" for the David character. "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," producer Jan Harlan reflected. "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [[Hans Moravec]] was brought in as a technical consultant.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;
Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought ''A.I.'' would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117799373 |title=A.I.

The film's [[soundtrack]] was released by [[Warner Sunset Records]] in 2001. The original [[Film score|score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and featured singers [[Lara Fabian]] on two songs and [[Josh Groban]] on one.

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. used an [[alternate reality game]] titled ''[[The Beast (game)|The Beast]]'' to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] that followed the storyline of ''The Beast'', but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking ''A.I.'' for a [[family film]], no action figures were created, although [[Hasbro]] released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.&lt;ref name=find/&gt;

''A.I.'' had its [[premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=David|title='Dust' in the wind for Venice fest|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|website=Variety|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2017-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030032135/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|archivedate=October 30, 2008|date=April 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on March 5, 2002 in both a standard full-screen release with no bonus features, and as a 2-Disc Special Edition featuring the film in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format as well as an eight-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]], two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s original storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/a-i-artificial-intelligence|title=A.I.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on April 5, 2011 by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] for the U.S. and by [[Warner Home Video]] for international markets.

===Critical response===
Based on 192 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 73% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism.

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE &amp;#124; The mind behind AI |work=BBC News |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,130942,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072644/http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0%2C8599%2C130942%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=''A.I.''&amp;nbsp;– Spielberg's Strange Love&amp;nbsp;– ''TIME'' |date=June 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars, saying that it was "wonderful and maddening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/ai-artificial-intelligence-2001 |title=A.I.

[[Mick LaSalle]] gave a largely negative review. "''A.I.'' exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless" [[Jar Jar Binks]], yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/29/DD239232.DTL |title=Artificial foolishness |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67p5z3LQ2?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F29%2FDD239232.DTL |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Peter Travers]] gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future."

In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/ai.html |title=Review: A.I |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] has speculated, "Worldwide, ''A.I.'' was very successful (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the [[alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]-style beings in the final 20 minutes were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |title=Author Talk: Ian Watson |publisher=Moon Milk Review |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67nCJehg6?url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic [[Joe Leydon]] that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film&amp;nbsp;– all the stuff in the house&amp;nbsp;– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of ''A.I.'', not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Leydon |url=http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |title='Minority Report' looks at the day after tomorrow&amp;nbsp;-- and is relevant to today &lt;!-- Apparently accidental typos in quoted refs should be "silently" repaired. --&gt; |work=Moving Picture Show |date=June 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815010940/http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11326">The ABC software metric was introduced by Jerry Fitzpatrick in 1997 to overcome the drawbacks of the LOC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jerry|date=1997|title=Applying the ABC metric to C, C++ and Java|url=http://www.softwarerenovation.com/ABCMetric.pdf|journal=C++ Report|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The metric defines an ABC score as a triplet of values that represent the size of a set of source code statements. An ABC score is calculated by counting the number of [[Assignment (computer science)|assignments]] (A), number of [[Branch (computer science)|branches]] (B), and number of [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]] (C) in a program. ABC score can be applied to individual [[Method (computer programming)|methods]], [[Function computer science|functions]], [[Class (computer programming)|classes]], [[modular programming|modules]] or [[File (computing)|files]] within a program.

ABC score is represented by a [[3d vector|3-D vector]] &lt; Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) &gt;. It can also be represented as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, which is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the vector &lt; Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) &gt;, and is calculated as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;|&lt;ABCvector&gt;| = \surd(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)&lt;/math&gt;

By convention, an ABC magnitude value is rounded to the nearest tenth.

== History ==
The concept of measuring software size was first introduced by Maurice Halstead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of Software Science|last=Halstead|first=Maurice|publisher=Elsevier|year=1977|isbn=|location=North Holland|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Purdue University in 1975. He suggested that every computer program consists mainly of [[Software token|tokens]]: [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]] and [[operand]]s. He concluded that a count of the number of unique operators and operands gives us a measure of the size of the program. However, this was not adopted as a measure of the size of a program.

[[Source lines of code|Lines of code]] (LOC) was another popular measure of the size of a program. The LOC was not considered an accurate measure of the size of the program because even a program with identical functionality may have different numbers of lines depending on the style of coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Norman E.|date=1991|title=Software Metrics: Successes, Failures and New Directions|url=https://www.agileconnection.com/sites/default/files/article/file/2014/Software%20Metrics-%20Successes,%20Failures,%20and%20New%20Directions.pdf|journal=Chapman &amp; Hall|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another metric called the [[Function point|Function Point]] (FP) metric was introduced to calculate the number of user input and output transactions. The function point calculations did not give information about both the functionality of the program and about the routines that were involved in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchenham|first=Barbara|date=December 1995|title=Towards a Framework for Software Measurement Validation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c0cb/2b8e826a19567b9e1c356a1d0063fb913e9f.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|volume=21|issue=12|doi=10.1109/32.489070|pages=929–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC metric is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the LOC, FP and token (operation and operand) counts. However, an FP score can also be used to supplement an ABC score.

Though the author contends that the ABC metric measures size, some believe that it measures complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jerry|date=2017|title=Timeless Laws of Software Development|publisher=Software Renovation Corporation|isbn=978-0999335604|chapter=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of the ABC metric to measure complexity depends on how complexity is defined.

== Definition ==
The three components of the ABC score are defined as following:

* Assignment: storage or transfer of data into a [[Variable (computer science)|variable]].
* Branches: an explicit forward program branch out of [[Scope (computer science)|scope]].
* Conditionals: [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] or logic test.

Since basic languages such as C, C++, Java, etc. have operations like assignments of variables, function calls and test conditions only, the ABC score has these three components.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

If the ABC vector is denoted as &lt;5,11,9&gt; for a [[subroutine]], it means that the subroutine has 5 assignments, 11 branches and 9 conditionals. For standardization purposes, the counts should be enclosed in angle brackets and written in the same order per the notation &lt;A, B, C&gt;.

It is often more convenient to compare source code sizes using a scalar value. The individual ABC counts are distinct so, per Jerry Fitzpatrick, we consider the three components to be [[Orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]], allowing a scalar ABC magnitude to be computed as shown above.

Scalar ABC scores lose some of the benefits of the vector. Instead of computing a vector magnitude, the [[weighted sum]] of the vectors may support more accurate size comparison. ABC scalar scores should not be presented without the accompanying ABC vectors, since the scalar values are not the complete representation of the size.

== Theory ==
The specific rules for counting ABC vector values should be interpreted differently for different languages due to [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] differences between them.

Therefore, the rules for calculating ABC vector slightly differ based on the language. We define the ABC metric calculation rules for C, C++ and Java below. Based on these rules the rules for other imperative languages can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ABC rules for C ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[C (programming language)|C]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=''').   
#* Occurrence of an [[Increment and decrement operators|increment or a decrement operator]] ('''++, --''').
# Add one to branch count when:   
#* Occurrence of a [[Subroutine|function call]].
#* Occurrence of any [[goto]] statement which has a target at a deeper level of [[Nesting (computing)|nesting]] than the level to the goto.
# Add one to condition count when: 
#* Occurrence of a [[conditional operator]] ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a [[unary operation|unary]] conditional operator.

=== ABC rules for C++ ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[C++]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude [[Constant (computer programming)|constant declarations]] and default [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter assignments]]) ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=''').    
#* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) ('''++, --''').    
#* Initialization of a variable or a nonconstant [[C++ classes|class member]].
# Add one to branch count when: 
#* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call.
#* Occurrence of any goto statement which has a target at a deeper level of nesting than the level to the goto. 
#* Occurrence of ‘new’ or ‘delete’ operators.
# Add one to condition count when:  
#* Occurrence of a conditional operator ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’, ‘'''try'''’, ‘'''catch'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator.

=== ABC rules for Java ===
The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
# Add one to the assignment count when:  
#* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude constant declarations and default parameter assignments) ('''=, *=, /=, %=, +=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, !=, ^=, &gt;&gt;&gt;=''').    
#* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) ('''++, --''').
# Add one to branch count when 
#* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call.    
#* Occurrence of a ‘new’ operator.
# Add one to condition count when:   
#* Occurrence of a conditional operator ('''&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=''').    
#* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘'''else'''’, ‘'''case'''’, ‘'''default'''’, ‘'''?'''’, ‘'''try'''’, ‘'''catch'''’).    
#* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator.

== Applications&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

=== Independent of style of coding ===
Since the ABC score metric is built on the idea that tasks like data storage, branching and conditional [[Software testing|testing]], this metric is independent of the user’s style of coding.

=== Project time estimation ===
ABC score calculation helps in estimating the amount of time needed to complete a project. This can be done by roughly estimating the ABC score for the project, and by calculating the ABC score of the program in a particular day. The amount of time taken for the completion for the project can be obtained by dividing the ABC score of the project by the ABC score achieved in one day.

=== Bug rate calculation ===
The [[Bug (computing)|bug]] rate was originally calculated as ''Number of bugs / LOC''. However, the LOC is not a reliable measure of the size of the program because it depends on the style of coding. A more accurate way of measuring bug rate is to count the - ''Number of bugs / ABC score''.

=== Program comparison ===
Programs written in different languages can be compared with the help of ABC scores because most languages use assignments, branches and conditional statements.

The information on the count of the individual parameters (number of assignments, branches and conditions) can help classify the program as ‘data strong’ or ‘function strong’ or ‘logic strong’. The vector form of an ABC score can provide insight into the driving principles behind the [[Application software|application]], whereas the details are lost in the scalar form of the score.

=== Linear metric ===
ABC scores are [[Linearity|linear]], so any file, module, class, function or method can be scored. For example, the (vector) ABC score for a module is the sum of the scores of its sub-modules. Scalar ABC scores, however, are non-linear.

{{Table Digital video broadcast standards}}
'''ATSC-M/H''' (''Advanced Television Systems Committee - Mobile/Handheld'') is a U.S. standard for [[mobile digital TV]] that allows TV broadcasts to be received by [[mobile device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a153/a_153-Part-1-2011.pdf A/153: ATSC Mobile DTV Standard, Parts 1 - 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403205237/http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a153/a_153-Part-1-2011.pdf |date=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATSC-M/H is a mobile TV extension to preexisting terrestrial TV broadcasting standard [[ATSC]] A/53. It corresponds to the European [[DVB-H]] and [[1seg]] extensions of [[DVB-T]] and [[ISDB-T]] terrestrial digital TV standards respectively. ATSC is optimized for a fixed reception in the typical North American environment and uses [[8VSB]] [[modulation]]. The ATSC transmission method is not robust enough against [[doppler shift]] and [[multipath interference|multipath]] [[radio interference]] in mobile environments, and is designed for highly directional fixed antennas. To overcome these issues, additional channel coding mechanisms are introduced in ATSC-M/H to protect the signal.

==Evolution of mobile TV standard==

===Requirements===
Several requirements of the new standard were fixed right from the beginning:
* Completely backward compatible with ATSC (A/53)
* Broadcasters can use their available license without additional restrictions
* Available legacy ATSC receivers can be used to receive the ATSC (A/53) standard without any modification.

===Proposals===
Ten systems from different companies were proposed, and two remaining systems were presented with transmitter and receiver prototypes:
* [[MPH (ATSC)|MPH]] (an [[acronym]] for [[wiktionary:mobility|mobile]]/[[pedestrian]]/[[handheld]], suggesting miles per hour), was developed by [[LG Electronics]] and [[Harris Broadcast]].  ([[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]], a subsidiary of LG, developed much of the original ATSC system.)
* [[A-VSB]] (Advanced-[[Single-sideband modulation|VSB]]) was developed by [[Samsung]] and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]].
To find the best solution, the Advanced Television Systems Committee assigned the Open Mobile Video Coalition (OMVC) to test both systems. The test report was presented on May 15, 2008.
As a result of this detailed work by the OMVC, a final standard draft was designed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, specialist group S-4. ATSC-M/H will be a hybrid. Basically the following components of the proposed systems are used:Syncword
* RF-Layer from the [[Mobile Pedestrian Handheld|MPH]] standard
* Deterministic frame structure from [[A-VSB]]
* Signaling of service designed on the base of the established mobile standards

===Standard milestones===
On December 1, 2008, the Advanced Television Systems Committee elevated its specification for Mobile Digital Television to Candidate Standard status. In the following six months, the industry tested the standard. Before it became an official standard, additional improvements were proposed. 
*ATSC members approved the ballot on October 15, 2009 to official standard A/153.
*ATSC introduced in January 2010 at Consumer Electronics Show, the name and logo for "MDTV" for ATSC A/153

==Structure of mobile DTV standard==
The ATSC Mobile DTV standard '''ATSC-M/H''' (A/153) is modular in concept, with the specifications for each of the modules contained separate Parts. The individual Parts of A/153 are as follows:

==Principle==
'''ATSC-M/H''' is a service for mobile TV receivers and partly uses the 19.39 Mbit/s [[ATSC]] [[8VSB]] stream.  The mobile data is carried in an unreferenced Packet ID, so legacy receivers ignore the mobile data. 
[[Image:ATSC Headend Block Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Block Diagram Headend]]

==Technology==
ATSC-M/H bandwidth consumes fixed chunks of 917kbit/s out of the total ATSC Bandwidth. Each such chunk is called an M/H Group. A data pipe called a parade is a collection of one to eight M/H groups. A parade conveys one or two ensembles which are logical pipes of IP datagrams. Those [[datagram]]s in turn carry TV services, System Signaling tables, [[OMA DRM]] key streams and the [[Electronic Service Guide]].
ATSC-M/H has an improved design based on detailed analyses of experiences with other mobile DTV standards.

[[Image:ATSC-MH Layer-Model.png|thumb|300px|ATSC-M/H Layer Model]]

===Protocol stack===
ATSC-M/H protocol stack is mainly an umbrella protocol that uses OMA ESG, OMA DRM, [[MPEG-4]] in addition to many [[IETF]] RFCs.

=== Transport stream data structure ===
The ATSC-M/H standard defines a fixed transport stream structure, based on M/H Frames, which establishes the location of M/H content within the VSB Frames and allows for easier processing by an M/H receiver.  This is contrary to the legacy ATSC transport stream, defined in A/53, in which there is no fixed structure to establish the phase of the data relative to VSB Frames.

One M/H Frame is equivalent in size to 20 VSB Frames and has an offset of 37 transport stream (TS) packets relative to the beginning of the VSB Frame.  Each M/H Frame, which has a fixed duration of 968 ms, is divided into five M/H sub-frames and each sub-frame is further subdivided into sixteen M/H Slots.  Each slot is the equivalent amount of time needed to transmit 156 TS packets.  A slot may either carry all main ATSC data (A/53) or 118 packets of M/H data and 38 packets of main data.  The collection of 118 M/H packets transmitted within a slot is called an M/H Group.  Each of the 118 M/H packets within an M/H Group are encapsulated inside a special TS packet, known as an MHE packet.

An M/H Parade is a collection of M/H Groups and can carry one or two M/H Ensembles. These Ensembles are logical pipes for IP datagrams. Those datagrams in turn carry TV services and the signaling of mobile content.  The M/H Groups from a single Parade are placed within M/H Slots according to an algorithm defined in A/153 Part 2.  The Number of Groups per M/H Sub-Frame (NoG) for an M/H Parade ranges from 1 to 8 and therefore the number of Groups per an M/H Frame for a Parade ranges from 5 to 40 with a step of 5. The data of a Parade are channel coded  and distributed by an [[interleaver]] during an M/H Frame.

Mobile Data are protected by an additional FEC, as Interleaving and [[Convolutional code]]s. To improve the reception in the receiver, [[Syncword|training sequences]] are introduced into the ATSC-M/H signal to allow channel estimation on the receiver side.

[[Time slicing (digital broadcasting)|Time slicing]] is a technique used by ATSC-M/H to provide power savings on receivers. It is based on the time-[[multiplexing|multiplexed]] transmission of different services.

=== Error protection ===
ATSC-M/H combines multiple error protection mechanisms for added robustness. One is an outer [[Reed–Solomon error correction]] code which corrects defective bytes after decoding the outer convolutional code in the receiver. The correction is improved by an additional CRC checksum since bytes can be marked as defective before they are decoded (erasure decoding).

The number of RS parity symbols can represent 24, 36 or 48. The symbols and the additional checksum  form the outer elements of a data matrix which is allocated by the payload of the M/H Ensemble. The number of lines is fixed and the number of columns is variable according to how many slots per Subframe are occupied.

The RS Frame is then partitioned into several segments of different sizes and assigned to specified regions. The M/H data in these regions are protected by an SCCC (Series Concatenated Convolutional Code), incorporating a code rate of 1/2 or 1/4, and is specific to each region in a group.  A 1/4 rate PCCC (Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code) is also employed as an inner code for the M/H signaling channel, which includes FIC (Fast Information Channel) and TPC (Transmission Parameter Channel).  The TPC carries various FEC modes and M/H Frame information.  Once the TPC is extracted, the receiver then knows the code rates being employed and can decode each region at its specified rate.

A modified trellis encoder is also employed for backwards compatibility with legacy A/53 receivers.

The time interleaving of ATSC-M/H is 1 second.

=== Signaling ===
ATSC M/H Signaling and Announcement defines three different layers of signalling. The layers are organized hierarchically and optimized to characteristics of the transmission layer.
* Transmission Signaling System is the lowest layer and uses the Transmission Parameter Channel (TPC). It provides information for the receiver needed to decode the signal
* Transport Signaling System is the second layer, which uses the Fast Information Channel (FIC) in combination with the Service Signaling Channel (SSC). The main purpose of the FIC is to deliver essential information to allow rapid service acquisition by the receiver. The Service Signaling Channel (SSC), consists of several different signaling tables. The information carried within these tables can be compared to the [[PSIP]] information of ATSC. The SSC provides mainly the basic information, the logical structure of the transmitted services and the decoding parameters for video and audio.
* Announcement / [[Electronic Service Guide]] (ESG) is the highest layer of signaling. It uses the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) Broadcast Service Enabler Suite ([[OMA BCAST]]) Electronic Service Guide (ESG). An ESG is delivered as a file data session File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE), and is used as the delivery protocol. The ESG consists of several [[XML]] sections. With this structure, a program guide and enabled interactive services can be realized.

===Signaling of video- and audio coding===
Each video- or audio decoder needs information about the used coding parameters, for instance resolution, frame rate and IDR (Random Access Point) repetition rate. 
In MPEG-4/AVC, mobile TV systems the receiver uses information from the [[Session Description Protocol]] File (SDP-File). 
The SDP-file is a format which describes streaming media initialization parameters. In ATSC-M/H, the SDP-File is transmitted within the SMT-Table. Most of the information is coded in binary, but some is coded in the original ASCII text format. The SMT-Table combines information that is typically in different tables and reduces the complexity for the network and the receivers. In case of signaling with ESG, the complete SDP-File is transmitted.

=== Single-frequency network (SFN) ===
In an SFN, two or more [[transmitters]] with an overlapping coverage send the same program content simultaneously on the same [[frequency]]. The [[8VSB]] [[modulation]] used by ATSC allows SFN transmissions.{{Citation needed|reason=Without extensive equalization?|date=June 2009}} To allow regular channel approximation, ATSC-M/H provides additional training sequences. ATSC A/110 defines a method to synchronize the ATSC modulator as part of the transmitter. The A/110 standard sets up the Trellis coder in a pre-calculated way to all transmitters of the SFN. In such an SFN, the ATSC-M/H multiplexer and the ATSC-M/H transmitter are synchronized by a [[GPS]] reference. The ATSC-M/H multiplexer operates as a network adapter and inserts time stamps in the [[MPEG transport stream]]. The transmitter analyzes the time stamp, delays the transport stream before it is modulated and transmitted. Eventually, all SFN transmitters generate a synchronized signal.

==Other mobile standards==
Until its shutdown, [[MediaFLO]] had been available in parts of the United States. It was a premium service that required subscription. ATSC-M/H would be [[free to air]], as are regular broadcast signals.

[[File:Active Noise Reduction.svg|thumb|300px| Graphical depiction of active noise reduction]]
'''Active noise control''' ('''ANC'''), also known as '''noise cancellation''', or '''active noise reduction''' ('''ANR'''), is a method for reducing unwanted [[sound]] by the addition of a second sound specifically designed to cancel the first.

== Explanation ==
Sound is a [[P-wave|pressure wave]], which consists of alternating periods of [[Compression (physical)|compression]] and [[rarefaction]]. A noise-cancellation speaker emits a sound wave with the same [[amplitude]] but with inverted phase (also known as [[antiphase]]) to the original sound. The waves combine to form a new wave, in a process called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], and effectively cancel each other out – an effect which is called [[destructive interference]].

Modern active noise control is generally achieved through the use of analog circuits or [[digital signal processing]]. Adaptive algorithms are designed to analyze the waveform of the background [[Noise (environmental)|aural]] or [[Noise (physics)|nonaural]] noise, then based on the specific algorithm generate a signal that will either phase shift or invert the polarity of the original signal. This inverted signal (in antiphase) is then amplified and a transducer creates a sound wave directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the amplitude of the original waveform, creating destructive interference. This effectively reduces the volume of the perceivable noise.

A noise-cancellation speaker may be co-located with the sound source to be [[Attenuation|attenuated]]. In this case it must have the same audio power level as the source of the unwanted sound. Alternatively, the transducer emitting the cancellation signal may be located at the location where sound attenuation is wanted (e.g. the user's ear). This requires a much lower power level for cancellation but is effective only for a single user. Noise cancellation at other locations is more difficult as the three-dimensional wavefronts of the unwanted sound and the cancellation signal could match and create alternating zones of constructive and destructive interference, reducing noise in some spots while doubling noise in others. In small enclosed spaces (e.g. the passenger compartment of a car) global noise reduction can be achieved via multiple speakers and feedback [[microphone]]s, and measurement of the modal responses of the enclosure.

== Applications ==
Applications can be "1-dimensional" or 3-dimensional, depending on the type of zone to protect.  Periodic sounds, even complex ones, are easier to cancel than random sounds due to the repetition in the wave form.

Protection of a "1-dimension zone" is easier and requires only one or two microphones and speakers to be effective. Several commercial applications have been successful: [[noise-cancelling headphones]], active mufflers, and the control of noise in air conditioning ducts. The term "1-dimension" refers to a simple pistonic relationship between the noise and the active speaker (mechanical noise reduction) or between the active speaker and the listener (headphones).

Protection of a 3-dimension zone requires many microphones and speakers, making it more expensive. Noise reduction is more easily achieved with a single listener remaining stationary but if there are multiple listeners or if the single listener turns his head or moves throughout the space then the noise reduction challenge is made much more difficult. High frequency waves are difficult to reduce in three dimensions due to their relatively short audio wavelength in air. The wavelength in air of sinusoidal noise at approximately 800&amp;nbsp;Hz is double the distance of the average person's left ear to the right ear;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgdkVhHUjEMC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 |title=Understanding and crafting the mix: the art of recording |last=Moylan |first=William |publisher=Focal Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-240-80755-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; such a noise coming directly from the front will be easily reduced by an active system but coming from the side will tend to cancel at one ear while being reinforced at the other, making the noise louder, not softer.&lt;ref&gt;The average head is about {{convert|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} from ear to ear. Assuming the speed of sound is 343 meters per second (1125 feet per second), the full wavelength of a tone of 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz reaches from ear to ear. A tone of half that frequency, 800&amp;nbsp;Hz, has a wavelength twice as long. A single such tone coming from the side will appear at the two ears 180 degrees out of phase—one ear compared to the other. An active noise control tone coming from a different angle will not be able to attenuate the original tone in both ears at once.&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency sounds above 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tend to cancel and reinforce unpredictably from many directions. In sum, the most effective noise reduction in three-dimensional space involves low frequency sounds. Commercial applications of 3-D noise reduction include the protection of aircraft cabins and car interiors, but in these situations, protection is mainly limited to the cancellation of repetitive (or periodic) noise such as engine-, propeller- or rotor-induced noise. This is because an engine's cyclic nature makes [[fast Fourier transform]] analysis and the noise cancellation easier to apply.

== Active vs. passive noise control ==
''Noise control'' is an active or passive means of reducing sound emissions, often for personal comfort, environmental considerations or legal compliance. ''Active'' noise control is sound reduction using a power source. ''Passive'' noise control is sound reduction by noise-isolating materials such as insulation, sound-absorbing tiles, or a [[muffler]] rather than a power source.

Active noise canceling is best suited for low frequencies. For higher frequencies, the spacing requirements for free space and zone of silence techniques become prohibitive. In acoustic cavity and duct based systems, the number of nodes grows rapidly with increasing frequency, which quickly makes active noise control techniques unmanageable. Passive treatments become more effective at higher frequencies and often provide an adequate solution without the need for active control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| |title=Active Noise Control|website=medialab|date= December 2005| url=http://www.medialab.ch/archiv/pdf_studien_diplomarbeiten/da05/da2005-104_ActiveNoiseControl.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050529/http://www.medialab.ch/archiv/pdf_studien_diplomarbeiten/da05/da2005-104_ActiveNoiseControl.pdf| dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1936 – The first patent for a noise control system was granted to inventor Paul Lueg {{US patent|2043416}}.

1950s – With {{US patent|2866848}}, {{US patent|2920138}}, {{US patent|2966549}} by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]], systems were created to cancel the noise in helicopter and airplane cockpits.

1957 – Willard Meeker developed a paper design and working model of active noise control applied to a circumaural earmuff. This headset had an active attenuation bandwidth of approximately 50–500&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a maximum attenuation of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |title=Evaluation of an Improved Active Noise Reduction Microphone using Speech Intelligibility and Performance-Based Testing, n.d. |access-date=2006-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026054112/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-143554/unrestricted/02rudissertation.pdf |archive-date=2015-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''alphabet effect''' is a group of hypotheses in [[communication theory]] arguing that [[Phonetics|phonetic]] [[writing]], and [[Alphabet|alphabetic scripts]] in particular, have served to promote and encourage the cognitive skills of [[abstraction]], analysis, coding, decoding, and classification. Promoters of these hypotheses are associated with the [[Toronto School of Communication]], such as [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Harold Innis]], [[Walter Ong]] and more recently [[Robert K. Logan]]; the term "alphabet effect" comes from Logan's 1986 work (see the bibliography below which references the 2004 second edition).

==Overview==

The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of [[symbol]]s in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction and the analytic skills needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed to the cognitive development of its users. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of phonetic writing and the alphabet in particular (as distinct from other types of writing systems) has made a significant impact on [[Western culture|Western]] thinking and development precisely because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, coding, decoding and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) while not suggesting a direct causal connection nevertheless suggest that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of [[Codification (law)|codified law]], [[monotheism]], abstract [[science]], [[deductive logic]], objective [[history]], and [[individualism]]. According to Logan, "All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the [[Tigris-Euphrates]] river system and the [[Aegean Sea]], and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C." (Logan 2004). The emergence of codified law in [[Sumer]] as exemplified by the Hammurabic code actually coincided with the reform of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Syllabary|syllabic]] system and is not directly influenced by the alphabet per se but rather by a phonetic writing system consisting of only sixty signs. Also it has to be pointed out that there was a robust scientific tradition in [[China]] but that science as practised in ancient China was not abstract but concrete and practical. In fact the impetus for formulating the Alphabet Effect was to explain why abstract science began in the West and not China despite the long list of [[invention]]s and [[technology]] that first appeared in China as documented by [[Joseph Needham]] in his book ''The Grand Titration'' (Needham 1969). The Alphabet Effect provides an alternative explanation to what is known as [[Needham's Grand Question]], namely why China had been overshot by the West in science and technology, despite its earlier successes.

Another impact of alphabetic writing was that it led to the invention of [[zero]], the [[Positional notation|place number system]], [[negative number]]s, and [[algebra]] by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[mathematician]]s in India 2000 years ago (Logan 2004). These ideas were picked up by [[Arab]] mathematicians and scientists and eventually made their way to Europe 1400 years later.

Prior to the written word there was a monopoly of knowledge by priests. (Innes: 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;4) This was because literacy was seen to be very time consuming. Therefore, all literacy was left in the hands of priests. With the priests monopolizing the content of religious texts there would be little or no dissention among the public. Thus the introduction of the alphabet substantially limited the power of the priests and religious texts were now open to society for questioning.

A social ramification of the introduction of the alphabet was the creation of social distinctions within society. Scholar Andrew Robinson supports this point by stating that those who are illiterate within society are seen as being deficient and ‘backward’ (Robinson: 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;215). Consequently, the development of the alphabet allowed for distinctions to be formed within society between the literate upper class and the illiterate lower class.

The development of the alphabet and hence the written word has also affected the impact of emotion. This point is also shared by Marshall McLuhan who believes that to translate a beautiful picture into words would be to deprive it of correctly articulating its best qualities (McLuhan: 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;83). Therefore, the written word has deprived both images and beautiful objects of the correct level of emotion with which to express their exact appearance.

The fact that the alphabet introduced the idea that a person’s writing could live on long after they died was another social ramification of the alphabet. This argument is also shared by Andrew Robinson. Robinson believes that the need for ‘immortality’ has always been of extreme importance for many authors. (Robinson: 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;83) As a result, the development of the written word allowed for the ‘immortality’ of authors and their written works.

==Criticism of the theory as ethnocentric==
Grosswiler (2004) notes that many scholars (including former adherents of the theory such as Goody) have pointed out that the theory is based on a particular Hellenocentric account of science, which neglects how different cultures have had hegemony scientifically irrespective of writing system

==Criticism of the theory's account of Chinese writing==
Several scholars have pointed out that the [[logogram|logographic]] account of Chinese writing is obsolete and incorrect. [[John DeFrancis]] suggests the use of the term semasiographic rather than logographic, because the idea of Chinese characters as pictorial in nature is only partially true. From Dominic Yu's account: 
:Take, for example, the character 他, representing the third person singular pronoun "tā". The left hand component, the "person" radical, indicates that this character vaguely has something to do with a person or people. I say "vaguely" because this is a very common radical is also used in characters such as 份, 假, and 做, meaning, "portion," "fake," and "to do," respectively. The right side is a phonetic component indicating that (at some earlier stage of Chinese), this character rhymed with 也, now pronounced "yě." Nothing in this character indicates the idea of "third person singular pronoun." From this example, we can see that Chinese characters mainly represent sounds, and only represent ideas in a rather insignificant way. Thus, Logan's claim that Chinese characters represent the "idea of a word" is baseless.

==Criticism of the theory from alternate paths to alphabetic script==
It has been suggested (by e.g. Grosswiler 2004) that [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat|Schmandt-Besserat's]] research into the origin of writing from three-dimensional tokens gives an alternative to the progressivist account of the Alphabet Effect theory. Grosswiler suggests that it is the potential for recording memory, not any one system of it, that propels a culture towards scientific thought.

{{Automation}}

'''Automation''' is the technology  by which a process  or procedure is performed with minimum human assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing: Materials, Processes, and Systems|last=Groover|first= Mikell|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation &lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995" /&gt; or automatic control is the use of various [[control system]]s for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention.  Some processes have been completely automated.

Automation covers applications ranging from a household [[thermostat]] controlling a boiler, to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. In control complexity it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high level algorithms.

In the simplest type of an automatic [[control loop]], a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value, and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of [[control theory]] was begun in the 18th century, and advanced rapidly in the 20th.

Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]], [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]], electrical, electronic devices and [[computer]]s, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, [[airplane]]s and [[ship]]s typically use all these combined techniques. The benefit of automation include labor savings, savings in [[Electricity|electricity costs]], savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy and precision.

The [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Report]] 2019 shows evidence that while automation displaces workers, innovation creates new industries and jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''automation'', inspired by the earlier word ''automatic'' (coming from ''[[automaton]]''), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department.&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"&gt;{{cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87477-779-8|pages=66, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting [[PID controller|feedback controllers]], which were introduced in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==
Fundamentally, there are two types of control loop; open loop control, and closed loop [[feedback]] control.

In open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the "process output" (or "controlled process variable"). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. (The control action is the switching on/off of the boiler. The process output is the building temperature).

In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy this would include a thermostat to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed back a signal to ensure the controller maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller therefore has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same as the "Reference input" or "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.&lt;ref&gt;"Feedback and control systems" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is 'a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.' &lt;ref name = mayr&gt;{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970
|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/TheOriginsOfFeedbackControlOttoMayr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, a ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control.&lt;ref name = mayr/&gt;
The advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, is feedback control, which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range.&lt;ref name="Bennett 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Stuart (1992). A history of control engineering, 1930-1955. IET. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-299-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical basis of closed loop automation is [[control theory]].
[[File:Centrifugal flyball governor.jpg|thumb|right| A [[flyball governor]] is an early example of a feedback control system.  An increase in speed would make the counterweights move outward, sliding a linkage that tended to close the valve supplying steam, and so slowing the engine. ]]

==Control actions==
{{Main|Control system}}

=== Discrete control (on/off) ===
One of the simplest types of control is ''on-off'' control. An example is the thermostat used on household appliances which either opens or closes an electrical contact. (Thermostats were originally developed as true feedback-control mechanisms rather than the on-off common household appliance thermostat.)

Sequence control, in which a programmed sequence of ''discrete'' operations is performed, often based on system logic that involves system states. An elevator control system is an example of sequence control.

===PID controller===
[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or "set point", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]
{{main |PID Controller}}
A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] ([[controller (control theory)|controller]]) widely used in [[industrial control system]]s.

In a [[PID loop]], the controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms, respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'') which give their name to the controller type.

The theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.

===Sequential control and logical sequence or system state control===
{{main| Programmable logic controller}}
Sequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler.

|-
|[[Image:Finite state machine example with comments.svg|thumb|center|This state diagram shows how [[Unified modeling language|UML]] can be used for designing a door system that can only be opened and closed]]
|}
States refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the door is open or closed, and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The elevator example is commonly used in programming texts, such as [[Unified modeling language]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An early development of sequential control was [[relay logic]], by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.

The total number of relays, cam timers and drum sequencers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early [[computer programming|programming]] techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being [[ladder logic]], where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called [[programmable logic controllers]] were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. 
  
In a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a ''control circuit'') a motor is started by pushing a "Start" or "Run" button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The "lock-in" relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The "lock in" contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a "stop" or "off" button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html|title=MOTOR STARTERS START STOPS HAND OFF AUTO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]]s are added to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case an interlock could be added to insure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.

[[Solenoid valve]]s are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering [[actuator]]s on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses.

===Computer control===
Computers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application. [[Programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in [[relay logic]] type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as [[PID controller|PID]]) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control [[algorithm]]s using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.

Control of an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. The ATM process has similarities with other online transaction processes. The different logical responses are called ''scenarios''. Such processes are typically designed with the aid of [[use case]]s and [[flowchart]]s, which guide the writing of the software code.The earliest feedback control mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285–222 BC)

==History==

===Early history===

[[Image:Clepsydra-Diagram-Fancy.jpeg|thumb|180px|Ctesibius's clepsydra (3rd century BC).]]
It was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time. In [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], about 270 BC, [[Ctesibius]] described a float regulator for a [[water clock]], a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet. This was the earliest feedback controlled  mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2010|title=The Roots of Automation Before Mechatronics|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M. |volume=4| issue=2| pages=42–43 |doi=10.1109/MIE.2010.936772 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete.

The [[History of Iran|Persian]] [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers, in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]'' (850 AD), described a number of automatic controls.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171021/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous [[variable structure control]]s, was developed by the Banu Musa brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Soft variable-structure controls: a survey|author=J.

''The Origins of Feedback Control'', [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution in Europe===
The introduction of [[Engine|prime movers]], or self-driven machines advanced grain mills, furnaces, boilers, and the [[steam engine]] created a new requirement for automatic control systems including [[thermostat|temperature regulator]]s (invented in 1624 (see [[Cornelius Drebbel]])), [[pressure regulator]]s (1681), [[float regulator]]s (1700) and [[speed control]] devices. Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745.&lt;ref name="Bennett 1979 pp"/&gt; Also in 1745, [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] invented the first automated loom. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. Thus, it was more of an art than a science. In the mid-19th century mathematics was first used to analyze the stability of feedback control systems. Since mathematics is the formal language of automatic control theory, we could call the period before this time the prehistory of control theory.

In 1771 [[Richard Arkwright]] invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power, known at the time as the [[water frame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tessie P.|last=Liu|title=The Weaver's Knot: The Contradictions of Class Struggle and Family Solidarity in Western France, 1750–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBcSaBxNP_4C&amp;pg=PA91|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8019-1|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automatic flour mill was developed by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Howard B.|title=Automation and Society|year=1959|publisher=Philosophical Library|location=New York, NY|page=8|author2=Joseph S.

[[File:Tower bridge steam engine.jpg|thumb|[[Steam engine]]s are a technology created during the 1700s used to promote automation.]]
The [[centrifugal governor]], which was invented by [[Christian Huygens]] in the seventeenth century, was used to adjust the gap between [[millstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/Mahoney/clarklec.html|title=Charting the Globe and Tracking the Heavens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwbWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|title=Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour|first=Richard E.|last=Bellman|date=8 December 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Another centrifugal governor was used by a Mr. Bunce of England in 1784 as part of a model [[steam crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DNWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA29-IA1|title=A course of lectures on the Steam Engine, delivered before the Members of the London Mechanics' Institution ...

The governor could not actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.&lt;ref name="Bennett 1979 pp"/&gt;

Several improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and [[control theory]].&lt;ref name="Bennett 1979 pp"/&gt;

The governor received relatively little scientific attention until [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the [[Second World War]] to [[fire control system]]s and aircraft [[navigation system]]s.&lt;ref name="Bennett 1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
[[Relay logic]] was introduced with factory [[electrification]], which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 though the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and operation of new high pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process control was on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced the 1930s. Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification.&lt;ref name="Field_2011"&gt;

Factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s. U. S. manufacturing productivity growth fell from 5.2%/yr 1919-29 to 2.76%/yr 1929-41.  Alexander Field notes that spending on non-medical instruments increased significantly from 1929–33 and remained strong thereafter.&lt;ref name="Field_2011"/&gt;

The First and Second World Wars saw major advancements in the field of [[mass communication]] and [[signal processing]]. Other key advances in automatic controls include [[differential equation]]s, [[stability theory]] and [[system theory]] (1938), [[Frequency response|frequency domain analysis]] (1940), [[Motion control|ship control]] (1950), and [[stochastic analysis]] (1941).

Starting in 1958, various systems based on [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]]&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt; [[digital electronics|digital logic]] modules for hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC)) emerged to replace electro-mechanical relay logic in [[industrial control system]]s for [[process control]] and automation, including early [[Telefunken]]/[[AEG]] [[Logistat]], [[Siemens]] {{ill|Simatic|de}}, [[Philips]]/[[Mullard]]/{{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} [[Norbit module|Norbit]], [[BBC]] [[Sigmatronic]], [[ACEC (company)|ACEC]] [[Logacec]], {{ill|Akkord-Radio{{!}}Akkord|de|Akkord-Radio}} [[Estacord]], Krone&lt;!-- AG --&gt; Mibakron, Bistat, Datapac, Norlog, SSR, or &lt;!-- ABB --&gt;Procontic systems.&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akkord_Estacord"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klingelnberg_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parr_1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissel_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker_2012"/&gt;

In 1959 Texaco's Port Arthur refinery became the first chemical plant to use [[digital control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rifkin|1995|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversion of factories to digital control began to spread rapidly in the 1970s as the price of computer hardware fell.

Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting [[Bell Labs]] to begin research on the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives

The logic performed by telephone switching relays was the inspiration for the digital computer.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.

Sectional electric drives were developed using control theory. Sectional electric drives are used on different sections of a machine where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making the paper sheet shrinks as it passes around steam heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;

Before automation many chemicals were made in batches. In 1930, with the widespread use of instruments and the emerging use of controllers, the founder of Dow Chemical Co. was advocating [[continuous production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=65}}Note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machine tools]] were automated with [[Numerical control]] (NC) using punched paper tape in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).

Today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process. Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting. Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.

===Space/computer age===

With the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency-domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in [[bang-bang control|hysteresis control systems]] such as [[navigation system]]s, [[fire-control system]]s, and [[electronics]]. Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for [[nonlinear systems]] (1961), [[navigation]] (1960), [[optimal control]] and [[estimation theory]] (1962), [[nonlinear control theory]] (1969), [[digital control]] and [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtering theory]] (1974), and the [[personal computer]] (1983).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Perhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Industrial Automation: Hands on|last = Lamb|first = Frank|publisher = |year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself. Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite_news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1790436902?pq-origsite=gscholar|title=The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS|last=Arnzt|first=Melanie|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantages of automation are:
*Increased throughput or productivity.
*Improved quality or increased predictability of quality.
*Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product.
*Increased consistency of output.
*Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses.
*Installation in operations reduces cycle time. 
*Can complete tasks where a high degree of accuracy is required.
*Replaces human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work (e.g., using one forklift with a single driver instead of a team of multiple workers to lift a heavy object)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&amp;L=1 Process automation, retrieved on 20.02.2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517174600/http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&amp;L=1 |date=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduces some occupational injuries (e.g., fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects)
*Replaces humans in tasks done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.)
*Performs tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc.
*Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly.
*Frees up workers to take on other roles.
*Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.

The main disadvantages of automation are:

*Possible security threats/vulnerability due to increased relative susceptibility for committing errors.
*Unpredictable or excessive development costs.
*High initial cost.
*Displaces workers due to job replacement.
*Leads to further environmental damage and could compound climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rainer Walz|author2=Joachim Schleich|title=The Economics of Climate Change Policies: Macroeconomic Effects, Structural Adjustments and Technological Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ai2XlE2qRwC&amp;pg=PA157|date=September 27, 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-7908-2078-2|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal impact==
{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}

Increased automation can often cause workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary. Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], when inventions like the [[steam engine]] were making some job categories expendable, workers forcefully resisted these changes. [[Luddites]], for instance, were English textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Luddite|title=Luddite|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar movements have sprung up periodically ever since. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the most influential of these movements were led by [[organized labor]], which advocated for the retraining of workers whose jobs were rendered redundant by machines.

Currently, the relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation. For example, while a recent study by the [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and [[artificial intelligence]] as a good thing, due to the country’s still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|title=The Robots are Coming, and Sweden is Fine|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2017|access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automation is already contributing significantly to unemployment, particularly in nations where the government does not proactively seek to diminish its impact. In the United States, 47% of all current jobs have the potential to be fully automated by 2033, according to the research of experts [[Carl Frey|Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne. Furthermore, wages and educational attainment appear to be strongly negatively correlated with an occupation’s risk of being automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf|title=THE FUTURE OF EMPLOYMENT: HOW SUSCEPTIBLE ARE JOBS TO COMPUTERISATION?|last=Frey|first=C. B.|last2=Osborne|first2=M.A.|date=17 September 2013|access-date=1 March 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Prospects are particularly bleak for occupations that do not presently require a university degree, such as truck driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/death-of-the-american-trucker-w514802 |title=Death of the American Trucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in high-tech corridors like [[Silicon Valley]], concern is spreading about a future in which a sizable percentage of adults have little chance of sustaining gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://mashable.com/2017/08/06/silicon-valley-automation-apocalypse-jamie-bartlett/#raCswumsKsqa |title=Silicon Valley luminaries are busily preparing for when robots take over}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the example of Sweden suggests, however, the transition to a more automated future need not inspire panic, if there is sufficient political will to promote the retraining of workers whose positions are being rendered obsolete.

==Lights out manufacturing==

{{Main|Lights out (manufacturing)}}
Lights out manufacturing is a production system with no human workers, to eliminate labor costs.

Lights Out Manufacturing grew in popularity in the U.S. when General Motors in 1982 implemented humans “hands-off” manufacturing in order to “replace risk-averse bureaucracy with automation and robots”. However, the factory never reached full “lights out” status.&lt;ref name="RCR Wireless News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20160810/internet-of-things/lights-out-manufacturing-tag31-tag99|title=Lights out manufacturing and its impact on society|date=2016-08-10|work=RCR Wireless News|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of Lights Out Manufacturing requires:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cnc-machine-tools.com/checklist-for-lights-out-manufacturing/|title=Checklist for Lights-Out Manufacturing|date=2017-09-04|work=CNC machine tools|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reliability of equipment
* Long term mechanic capabilities
* Planned preventative maintenance
* Commitment from the staff

==Health and environment==
{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}

The costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hazardous operations, such as [[oil refining]], the manufacturing of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemicals]], and all forms of [[metal working]], were always early contenders for automation.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment, although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors. Because [[automated vehicle]]s are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human-driven vehicles, some precautions built into current models (such as [[anti-lock brake]]s or [[laminated glass]]) would not be required for self-driving versions. Removing these safety features would also significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle, thus increasing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and reducing emissions per mile. Self-driving vehicles are also more precise with regard to acceleration and breaking, and this could contribute to reduced emissions. Self-driving cars could also potentially utilize fuel-efficient features such as route mapping that is able to calculate and take the most efficient routes. Despite this potential to reduce emissions, some researchers theorize that an increase of production of self-driving cars could lead to a boom of vehicle ownership and use. This boom could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self-driving cars if a large enough number of people begin driving personal vehicles more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4476614/self-driving-cars-environment/ |title=Self-Driving Cars Could Help Save the Environment—Or Ruin It. It Depends on Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment, but the benefits of these features are also questioned. A study of energy consumption of automated homes in Finland showed that [[smart home]]s could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks (such as automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low). This study, along with others, indicated that the smart home’s ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage. However, new research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as non-automated homes. A more recent study has indicated that, while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels does decrease unnecessary energy use, this process requires monitoring systems that also consume a significant amount of energy. This study suggested that the energy required to run these systems is so much so that it negates any benefits of the systems themselves, resulting in little to no ecological benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896315001597 |title=Environmental Impacts and Benefits of Smart Home Automation: Life Cycle Assessment of Home Energy Management System|journal=IFAC-Papers ''On'' ''Line''|volume=48|pages=880|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.05.158|year=2015|last1=Louis|first1=Jean-Nicolas|last2=Calo|first2=Antonio|last3=Leiviskä|first3=Kauko|last4=Pongrácz|first4=Eva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convertibility and [[turnaround time]]==

Another major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the [[production line]]s. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of [[Automated Guided Vehicle]]s with Natural Features Navigation.

Digital electronics helped too. Former analogue-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization and operation. This was accompanied by the [[fieldbus]] revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.

[[Discrete manufacturing]] plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogue-based measurement and control still dominates. The growing use of [[Industrial Ethernet]] on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for [[Reconfigurable Manufacturing System]]s.

==Automation tools==
Engineers can now have [[numerical control]] over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. [[Computer-aided technologies]] (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD software) and [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448504000491 |title=Engineers' CAx education—it's not only CAD |journal=Computer-Aided Design |volume=36 |issue=14 |pages=1439 |doi=10.1016/j.cad.2004.02.011|year=2004 |last1=Werner Dankwort |first1=C |last2=Weidlich |first2=Roland |last3=Guenther |first3=Birgit |last4=Blaurock |first4=Joerg E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Information technology]], together with [[industry|industrial]] [[machinery]] and [[industrial process|process]]es, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an [[industrial control systems|industrial control system]] is a [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) [[sensor]]s and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events.&lt;ref name="Reference.com"&gt;

[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An [[automated online assistant]] on a website, with an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] for enhanced [[human–computer interaction]].]]
[[Human-computer interaction|Human-machine interface]]s (HMI) or [[Human–computer interaction|computer human interfaces]] (CHI), formerly known as ''man-machine interfaces'', are usually employed to communicate with PLCs and other computers. Service personnel who monitor and control through HMIs can be called by different names. In industrial process and manufacturing environments, they are called operators or something similar. In boiler houses and central utilities departments they are called stationary engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos228.htm|title=Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of automation tools exist:
* ANN – [[Artificial Neural Network]]
* DCS – [[Distributed Control System]]
* HMI – [[Human Machine Interface]]
* SCADA – [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]]
* PLC – [[Programmable Logic Controller]]
* [[Instrumentation]]
* [[Motion control]]
* [[Robotics]]

When it comes to factory automation, Host Simulation Software (HSS) is a commonly used testing tool that is used to test the equipment software. HSS is used to test equipment performance with respect to Factory Automation standards (timeouts, response time, processing time).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/effective_host_simulation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations to automation===
*Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks.
*Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of product, making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous. Therefore, some personnel are needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained.
*As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained. This is an example of both [[diminishing returns]] and the [[logistic function]].
*As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This is an example of exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may however set new limits that surpass the previous limits.

===Current limitations===
Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level [[pattern recognition]], [[language comprehension]], and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see [[Watson (computer)]]). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where automation of industrial tasks is possible. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to [[post-scarcity]] economics.

==== Paradox of automation ====

The [[paradox]] of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical.

If an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it’s fixed or shut down. This is where human operators come in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personalmba.com/paradox-of-automation/|title=Paradox of Automation – The Personal MBA|first=Josh|last=Kaufman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fatal example of this was [[Air France Flight 447]], where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/children-of-the-magenta-automation-paradox-pt-1/|title=Children of the Magenta (Automation Paradox, pt. 1) – 99% Invisible|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive automation ==
Cognitive automation, as a subset of [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guhathakurta|first=Rahul|date=|year=2018|title=Cognitive Automation — Going beyond Rule-based RPA|url=https://www.indrastra.com/2018/09/Cognitive-Automation-004-09-2018-0006.html|journal=IndraStra Global|publication-place=New York|volume=004|pages=0006|issn=2381-3652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging genus of automation enabled by [[cognitive computing]]. Its primary concern is the automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring [[unstructured data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesiliconreview.com/magazines/automate-complex-workflows-using-tactical-cognitive-computing-coseer/|title=Automate Complex Workflows Using Tactical Cognitive Computing: Coseer|website=thesiliconreview.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive automation relies on multiple disciplines: natural language processing, real-time computing, machine learning algorithms, big data analytics and evidence-based learning. According to [[Deloitte]], cognitive automation enables the replication of human tasks and judgment “at rapid speeds and considerable scale.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/deloitte-analytics/articles/cognitive-automation.html|title=Cognitive automation: Streamlining knowledge processes {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such tasks include:
* Document redaction
* Data extraction and document synthesis / reporting
* Contract management
* Natural language search
* Customer, employee, and stakeholder onboarding
* Manual activities and verifications
* Follow up and email communications

'''Stores'''
{{Main|Automated retail}}
Many [[supermarkets]] and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing [[Self checkout]] systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers. In the United States, the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 (around 1 in 9 Americans in the workforce). Globally, an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by [[Eurasia Group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721900-love-affair-shopping-has-gone-online-decline-established-american-retailing|title=The decline of established American retailing threatens jobs|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online shopping]] could be considered a form of automated retail as the payment and checkout are through an automated [[Online transaction processing]] system, with the share of online retail accounting jumping from 5.1% in 2011 to 8.3% in 2016 {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. However, two-thirds of books, music and films are now purchased online. In addition, automation and online shopping could reduce demands for shopping malls, and retail property, which in America is currently estimated to account for 31% of all commercial property or around 7 billion square feet. Amazon has gained much of the growth in recent years for online shopping, accounting for half of the growth in online retail in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other forms of automation can also be an integral part of online shopping, for example the deployment of automated warehouse robotics such as that applied by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] using [[Kiva Systems]].

===Automated mining===
{{main|Automated mining}} Automated mining involves the removal of human labor from the [[mining]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/rio-to-trial-automated-mining/story-e6frg9df-1111115351260 ''Rio to trial automated mining''] at The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mining#Mining industry|mining industry]] is currently in the transition towards automation. Currently it can still require a large amount of [[human capital]], particularly in the [[third world]] where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation.

===Automated video surveillance===

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) started the research and development of automated visual [[surveillance]] and monitoring (VSAM) program, between 1997 and 1999, and airborne video surveillance (AVS) programs, from 1998 to 2002. Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated [[Space Tracking and Surveillance System|tracking surveillance]] system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the amount of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.&lt;ref&gt;Javed, O, &amp; Shah, M.

===Automated highway systems===
{{main|Automated highway systems}}

As demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied, interest in automation has grown. Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the [[United States Congress]] authorized more than $650 million over six years for [[intelligent transport system]]s (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that "the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles." [ISTEA 1991, part B, Section 6054(b)].

Full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.&lt;ref&gt;Menzies, Thomas.

===Home automation===
{{main|Home automation}}
Home automation (also called [[domotics]]) designates an emerging practice of increased automation of household appliances and features in residential dwellings, particularly through electronic means that allow for things impracticable, overly expensive or simply not possible in recent past decades. The rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions. However, the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domautics.com/home-automation-system|title=Smart &amp; Intelligent Home Automation Solutions|last=|first=|date=2018-05-15|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial automation===
Industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing, quality control and material handling processes. General purpose controllers for industrial processes include Programmable logic controllers, stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanised equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of [[Machine vision]] to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply require in industries.

The integration of control and information across the enterprise enables industries to optimise [https://digitalcontrols.org industrial process] operations.

Energy efficiency in industrial processes has become a higher priority. Semiconductor companies like Infineon Technologies are offering 8-bit micro-controller applications for example found in motor controls, general purpose pumps, fans, and ebikes to reduce energy consumption and thus increase efficiency.

====Industrial Automation and Industry 4.0====
The rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the “fourth industrial revolution”, which is better known now as Industry 4.0. Originating from Germany, Industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devises, concepts, and machines.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.11113/jt.v78.9285|title = Industry 4.0: A Review on Industrial Automation and Robotic| journal=Jurnal Teknologi| volume=78| issue=6–13|year = 2016|last1 = Kamarul Bahrin|first1 = Mohd Aiman| last2=Othman| first2=Mohd Fauzi| last3=Nor Azli| first3=Nor Hayati| last4=Talib| first4=Muhamad Farihin}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, along with the advancement of the Industrial Internet of Things (formally known as the IoT or IIoT) which is “Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1109/IMIS.2012.134|chapter = Integrating Building Automation Systems and IPv6 in the Internet of Things|title = 2012 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing| pages=683–688|year = 2012|last1 = Jung|first1 = Markus| last2=Reinisch| first2=Christian| last3=Kastner| first3=Wolfgang| isbn=978-1-4673-1328-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 works with the IIoT and software/hardware to connect in a way that (through communication technologies) add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes. Being able to create smarter, safer, and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies. It opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable, consistent, and efficient that before. Implementation of systems such as [[SCADA]] are an example of software that take place in Industrial Automation today. SCADA is a supervisory data collection software, just one of the many used in Industrial Automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.18845/tm.v28i4.2438|title = Los sistemas SCADA en la automatización industrial| journal=Revista Tecnología en Marcha| volume=28| issue=4| pages=3|year = 2015|last1 = Pérez-López|first1 = Esteban}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry 4.0 vastly covers many areas in manufacturing and will continue to do so as time goes on.&lt;ref name="doi.org" /&gt;

====Industrial Robotics====
[[File:Workmaster.jpg|alt=Large automated milling machines inside a big warehouse-style lab room|thumb|Automated milling machines]]
[[Industrial robotics]] is a sub-branch in the industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include; machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shell|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Industrial Automation|date=2000|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial robots utilizes various mechanical, electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision, accuracy and speed that far exceeds any human performance. The birth of industrial robot came shortly after World War II as United States saw the need for a quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurfess|first1=Thomas|title=Robotics and Automation Handbook|date=2005|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Servos, digital logic and solid state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and overtime these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance. In 1997, there were 700,000 industrial robots in use, the number has risen to 1.8M in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceosurvey/2017/gx/talent.html|title=Managing man and machine|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|work=PwC|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) with [[robotics]] are also used in creating an automatic labelling solution, using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator, and AI for learning and detecting the products to be labelled. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite web|url= https://milliontech.com/solutions/label-printing/irls-intelligent-robotics-labeling-system|title=AI Automatic Label Applicator &amp; Labelling System

====Programmable Logic Controllers====
Industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolten|first1=William|title=Programmable Logic Controllers (5th Edition)|date=2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|Siemens Simatic S7-400 system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]
PLCs can range from small "building brick" devices with tens of I/O in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.

They can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs (I/O), extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].

It was from the automotive industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of [[relay]]s, [[cam timer]]s, [[drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencer]]s, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model [[changeover|change-over]] was very time consuming and expensive, as [[electrician]]s needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.

When digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges this the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete (bit-form) input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern (fast, small, reliable) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.&lt;ref name=Parr00&gt;E. A. Parr, ''Industrial Control Handbook'', Industrial Press Inc., 1999 {{ISBN|0-8311-3085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agent-assisted automation====
{{main|Agent-assisted automation}}
Agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit card numbers or CVV codes&lt;ref name="adsit"&gt;{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1854&amp;Itemid=1&amp;Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= 21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing. Agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process. The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time.

==Relationship to unemployment==
{{main|Technological unemployment}}
Research by  [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne of the [[Oxford Martin School]] argued that employees engaged in "tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms" are at risk of displacement, and 47 per cent of jobs in the US were at risk. The study, released as a working paper in 2013 and published in 2017, predicted that automation would put low-paid physical occupations most at risk, by surveying a group of colleagues on their opinions.&lt;ref name=OMS913&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carl Benedikt Frey  |author2=Michael Osborne|title=The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314|publisher=[[Oxford Martin School]]|accessdate=7 November 2015|format=publication|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a study published in [[McKinsey Quarterly]]&lt;ref name=MKQ1115&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael Chui |author2=James Manyika |author3=Mehdi Miremadi |title=Four fundamentals of workplace automation As the automation of physical and knowledge work advances, many jobs will be redefined rather than eliminated—at least in the short term.|url=http://www.mckinsey.com//Insights/Business_Technology/Four_fundamentals_of_workplace_automation|publisher=[[McKinsey Quarterly]]|accessdate=7 November 2015|date=November 2015|quote=Very few occupations will be automated in their entirety in the near or medium term.

Gregory and U. Zierahn (2016), "[https://futuroexponencial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/OECD.pdf The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis]", ''OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers'', No. 189, OECD Publishing, Paris, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org.mutex.gmu.edu/10.1787/5jlz9h56dvq7-en&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama White House has pointed out that every 3 months "about 6 percent of jobs in the economy are destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses, while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are added".&lt;ref&gt;Executive Office of the President, Artificial Intelligence, Automation and the Economy ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/EMBARGOED%20AI%20Economy%20Report.pdf December 2016]) 2 and 13–19.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent MIT economics study of automation in the United States from 1990 to 2007 found that there may be a negative impact on employment and wages when robots are introduced to an industry. When one robot is added per one thousand workers, the employment to population ratio decreases between 0.18–0.34 percentages and wages are reduced by 0.25–0.5 percentage points. During the time period studied, the US did not have many robots in the economy which restricts the impact of automation. However, automation is expected to triple (conservative estimate) or quadruple (generous estimate) leading these numbers to become substantially higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Restrepo|first2=Pascual|title=Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|accessdate=February 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403004714/https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763|archive-date=3 April 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a formula by [[Gilles Saint-Paul]], an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Paul, G. (2008). Innovation and inequality:How does technical progress affect workers? Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products, [[Working time#Gradual decrease in working hours|lower average work hours]], and new industries forming (i.e., robotics industries, computer industries, design industries). These new industries provide many high salary skill based jobs to the economy. By 2030, between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector. While the number of jobs lost to automation are often offset by jobs gained from technological advances, the same type of job lost is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lower-middle class. This occurs largely in the US and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for high skilled labor but demand for middle wage labor continues to fall. Economists call this trend “income polarization” where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation|date=December 2017|publisher=Mckinsey &amp; Company|pages=1–20|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-Jobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Report-December-6-2017.ashx|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological exponential growth''' is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the [[habitat]], the [[population]] of an [[organism]] living in the habitat grows in an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each female that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Miller and Stephen B. Harley zoology 4th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans.

Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as [[Charles Darwin]] observed while developing his theory of [[natural selection]].

If, in a hypothetical population of size ''N'', the birth rates (per capita) are represented as ''b'' and death rates (per capita) as ''d'', then the increase or decrease in ''N'' during a time period ''t'' will be:

&lt;math&gt;dN/dt=(b-d)N&lt;/math&gt;

(b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]] on population growth.

Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous [[Population density|population densities]] in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the [[elephant]] could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

{{anchor|Byte machine}}'''Byte addressing''' refers to hardware architectures which support accessing individual [[byte]]s of data rather than only larger units called [[word orientation|words]], which would be ''[[word-addressable]]''. Such computers are sometimes called ''byte machines''&lt;ref name="Hansen_1986"/&gt; (in contrast to ''[[word machine]]s'').&lt;ref name="Economia_Word"/&gt;

The basic unit of digital storage is called a [[bit]], storing a single 0 or 1. 

Many common architectures can address more than 8 bits of data at a time. For example, the [[Intel]] [[386SX]] processor can handle 16-bit (two-byte) data, since data is transferred over a 16-bit [[computer bus|bus]]. However, data in memory may be of various lengths.

A 64-bit architecture machine might still need to access 8-bit data over its 64-bit address line, and have the data returned in the bottom 8 bits of its longer data line.

Byte addressable memory refers to architectures where data can be accessed and addressed in units that are narrower than the bus. An eight-bit processor like the [[Intel 8008]] addresses eight bits, but as this is the full width of the bus, this is regarded as word-addressable. The 386SX, which addresses memory in 8-bit units but can fetch and store it 16 bits at a time, is termed byte-addressable.

Bytes have not always meant 8 bits; in fact, depending on the platform, byte sizes of 1&lt;ref name="Buchholz_1977"/&gt; to 48 bits&lt;ref name="CDC_1966"/&gt; have been used in the past. Therefore, the term "[[octet (computing)|octet]]" is used where the context makes byte-length ambiguous.

For example, in the 1980s, [[Honeywell]] mainframes had 36-bit words, and were byte-addressable in 9-bit bytes, or "nonets", They used 7- or 8-bit character codes, either of which were stored one to each 9-bit byte, making characters individually addressable.

To illustrate why byte addressing is useful, consider the [[IBM 7094]], which is word-addressable and has no concept of a byte. It has 36-bit words, and stores its six-bit character codes six to a word.

To change the 16th character in a string, the program has to determine that this is the fourth character of the third word in the string, fetch the third word, mask out the old value of the fourth character from the value held in the register, "or" in the new one, and then store back the amended word. At least six machine instructions. Usually these are relegated to a subroutine, so every store or fetch of a single character involves the overhead of calling a subroutine and returning. 

With byte addressing, that can be achieved in one instruction: store this character code at that byte address. Text programs are easier to write, smaller, and run faster.

The advantage of word addressing is that more memory can be addressed in the same number of bits. The IBM 7094 has 15-bit addresses, so could address 32,768 words of 36 bits. The machines were often built with a full complement of addressable memory. Addressing 32,768 bytes of 6 bits would have been much less useful for scientific and engineering users. 

Or consider the 32-bit [[Pentium]] processor. Its 32-bit address bus can address 4 billion different items. Using word addressing, a 32-bit address bus could address 4 Gigawords; or 16 Gigabytes using the modern 8-bit byte. If the 386SX and its successors had used word addressing, scientists, engineers, and gamers could all have enjoyed programs that were 4x larger on 32-bit machines. 

Then again, word processing, rendering HTML, and all other text applications would have run more slowly.

When computers were so costly that they were only or mainly used for science and engineering, word addressing was the obvious mode. As it became cost-effective to use computers for handling text, hardware designers moved to byte addressing.

Some systems, such as the [[PDP-10]], use word addressing but facilitate access to individual bytes using special instructions which can access memory using a ''byte pointer'', which contains both a word address and the index of a specific byte within the word.

A [[byte]] was described as consisting of any number of parallel bits from one to six. Thus a byte was assumed to have a length appropriate for the occasion. Its first use was in the context of the input-output equipment of the 1950s, which handled six bits at a time. The possibility of going to 8 bit bytes was considered in August 1956 and incorporated in the design of Stretch shortly thereafter. The first published reference to the term occurred in 1959 in a paper "Processing Data in Bits and Pieces" by [[Gerrit Anne Blaauw|G&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;Blaauw]], [[Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr.|F&amp;nbsp;P&amp;nbsp;Brooks&amp;nbsp;Jr]] and [[Werner Buchholz|W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz]] in the ''[[IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers]]'', June 1959, page 121. The notions of that paper were elaborated in Chapter 4 of ''Planning a Computer System (Project Stretch)'', edited by W&amp;nbsp;Buchholz, [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]] (1962). The rationale for coining the term was explained there on page 40 as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Byte ''denotes a group of bits used to encode a character, or the number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from input-output units. A term other than ''character'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (ie, different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)''&lt;br/&gt;[[System/360]] took over many of the Stretch concepts, including the basic byte and word sizes, which are powers of 2. For economy, however, the byte size was fixed at the 8 bit maximum, and addressing at the bit level was replaced by byte addressing. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''constraint''' is a condition of an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem that the solution must satisfy. There are several types of constraints&amp;mdash;primarily [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] constraints, [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] constraints, and [[Integer programming|integer constraints]]. The set of [[candidate solution]]s that satisfy all constraints is called the [[feasible set]].

==Example==
The following is a simple optimization problem:
:&lt;math&gt;\min f(\mathbf x) = x_1^2+x_2^4&lt;/math&gt;

subject to

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;x_2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the vector (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

In this example, the first line defines the function to be minimized (called the [[objective function]], loss function, or cost function). The second and third lines define two constraints, the first of which is an inequality constraint and the second of which is an equality constraint. These two constraints are [[hard constraint]]s, meaning that it is required that they be satisfied; they define the feasible set of candidate solutions.

Without the constraints, the solution would be (0,0), where &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; has the lowest value. But this solution does not satisfy the constraints. The solution of the [[constrained optimization]] problem stated above is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (1,1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the point with the smallest value of &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the two constraints.

== Terminology ==
* If an inequality constraint holds with ''equality'' at the optimal point, the constraint is said to be '''{{visible anchor|binding}}''', as the point ''cannot'' be varied in the direction of the constraint even though doing so would improve the value of the objective function.
* If an inequality constraint holds as a ''strict inequality'' at the optimal point (that is, does not hold with equality), the constraint is said to be '''{{visible anchor|non-binding}}''', as the point ''could'' be varied in the direction of the constraint, although it would not be optimal to do so. If a constraint is non-binding, the optimization problem would have the same solution even in the absence of that constraint.
* If a constraint is not satisfied at a given point, the point is said to be '''[[Feasible region|infeasible]]'''.

==Hard and soft constraints==

If the problem mandates that the constraints be satisfied, as in the above discussion, the constraints are sometimes referred to as ''hard constraints''. However, in some problems, called [[Constraint satisfaction problem#Flexible CSPs|flexible constraint satisfaction problems]], it is preferred but not required that certain constraints be satisfied; such non-mandatory constraints are known as ''[[Constraint optimization#Definition|soft constraints]]''. Soft constraints arise in, for example, [[preference-based planning]]. In a [[MAX-CSP]] problem, a number of constraints are allowed to be violated, and the quality of a solution is measured by the number of satisfied constraints.

A '''culmicole''' is an [[organism]] that lives on the apexes of [[grass]] [[leaves]] and stems. An example of a culmicole are [[species]] of [[planthopper]]s, which spend their lives perched on grass blades. The name was first coined by Lincoln et al. in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference: A Dictionary of Animal Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution| last=Barrows| first=Edward| year=2001| publisher=CRC Press| page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Aldrich Dictionary of Phobias and Other Word Families|first=Chris|last=Aldrich|publisher=Trafford Publishing|date=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7iDw172KBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18|isbn=9781553698869}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Depthx commons détouré.jpg|thumb|Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer]]
The '''Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer''' ('''DEPTHX''') is an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] designed and built by [[Stone Aerospace]], an [[aerospace engineering]] firm based in [[Austin]], [[Texas]].  It was designed to [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] explore and map underwater [[sinkholes]] in northern Mexico, as well as collect water and wall core samples.  The DEPTHX vehicle was the first of three vehicles to be built by Stone Aerospace which were funded by [[NASA]] with the goal of developing technology that can explore the oceans of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] to look for [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2007-02/robot-subs-space "Robot Subs in Space"].  ''[[Popular Science]]''.  1 Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/swimming-to-europa "Swimming to Europa"].  ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]''.

''[[Wired magazine]]''. 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DEPTHX was a collaborative project for which Stone Aerospace was the [[principal investigator]].  Co-investigators included [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which was responsible for the navigation and guidance software, the [[Southwest Research Institute]], which built the vehicle's science [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]], and research scientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[Colorado School of Mines]], and [[NASA]] [[Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/depthx/about.html About the DEPTHX Project].

In 1999, [[William Stone (caver)|Bill Stone]] had been involved in an underwater [[surveying]] project in [[Wakulla Springs]], [[Florida]].  For that project, Stone had devised a digital wall mapper that was propelled by a [[diver propulsion vehicle]] and steered by divers which was designed to create a 3-D map of Wakulla Springs using an array of sonars, as well as a suite of other sophisticated sensors.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usdct.org/wakulla2-technology.php Wakulla 2 Technology]. U.S. Deep Caving Team. Retrieved 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project, the Wakulla Springs 2 Project, attracted the interest of [[Planetary science|planetary scientist]] [[Dan Durda]] from the Southwest Research Institute, who wished to create a similar piece of technology to explore the oceans of Europa, but one that could drive itself autonomously.  Stone accepted the challenge, and several collaborative proposals were submitted to NASA.  It wasn't until 2003 that NASA would finally fund DEPTHX as a three-year, $5 million project.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

The vehicle underwent several different design concepts over the next couple of years as engineers at Stone Aerospace explored various options. Initial designs focused on a less [[ellipsoidal]] design, however these designs were abandoned due to concerns that such a shape would be difficult to maneuver out of the potentially tight spots it might encounter during the exploration of unknown territory.  It was also during this time that the DEPTHX team did a field campaign at [[Cenote]] [[Zacatón]] using a drop [[CTD (instrument)|sonde]] to acquire some initial data for the software team, which itself contributed to the overall design changes.  The final design was decided upon in 2006, at which point construction of the vehicle began.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105124702/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/about-us/about-us-history.php Stone Aerospace History].  Stone Aerospace.  Retrieved: 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com/news-/news-zacaton.php News: Zacaton 1 Field Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912182200/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/news-/news-zacaton.php |date=2012-09-12 }}. Stone Aerospace.  Retrieved 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed vehicle was about {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter and weighed about {{convert|3300|lb|kg}}.  It had redundant navigation systems including 54 sonars, an [[inertial measurement unit]], [[Doppler Velocity Log|doppler velocity logger]], as well as depth gauges and [[accelerometers]].  Propulsion systems were also redundant, having six thrusters and two equivalent battery stacks.  It was outfitted with a variable [[buoyancy]] system, and finally with the science payload that included the ability to take in water and solid core samples for later analysis, as well as an onboard microscope to analyze water samples in real time.&lt;ref name="popsci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="depthx"&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php DEPTHX (DEep Phreatic THermal eXplorer)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151122212722/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php |date=2015-11-22 }}.  Stone Aerospace.  Retrieved 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==

During the DEPTHX 2007 deployment, the vehicle was able to create 3-D maps of four cenotes in Sistema Zacatón in [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]].  This was the first autonomous system to explore and map a [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] cavern.  The mapping of Cenote Zacatón was particularly notable because its depth was previously unknown, as human divers had not been successful in attempts to reach the bottom.  DEPTHX created the first map of the bottom of Zacatón, which has a depth of over {{convert|1000|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/NA/Mexico/Tamaulipas/SistemaZacaton.htm Sistema Zacatón]. Wondermondo.  Retrieved 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  DEPTHX was the first robotic system of any kind to implement [[three-dimensional]] [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM).  It was also the first such system to make its own decisions on where and how to collect samples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php DEPTHX (DEep Phreatic THermal eXplorer)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151122212722/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php |date=2015-11-22 }}. Stone Aerospace. Retrieved 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  From these samples, at least three new [[Phylum|divisions]] of bacteria were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02324.x/abstract A comparative molecular analysis of water-filled limestone sinkholes in north-eastern Mexico]. Wiley Online Library.  25 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the DEPTHX mission led to the funding of the follow-on project, [[ENDURANCE]].  The ENDURANCE vehicle reused the frame and a number of systems from the DEPTHX vehicle, but was considerably reconfigured for the needs of the [[Antarctic]] environment.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">In [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], especially [[metalogic]] and [[computability theory]], an '''effective method'''&lt;ref name="metalogic"&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]], ''Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic'', University of California Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; or '''effective procedure''' is a procedure for solving a problem from a specific class. An effective method is sometimes also called '''mechanical''' method or procedure.&lt;ref name=alanturingnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Copeland|first=B.J.|title=The Turing-Church Thesis|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/reference%20articles/The%20Turing-Church%20Thesis.html|work=AlanTuring.net|publisher=Turing Archive for the History of Computing|date=June 2000|accessdate=23 March 2013|authorlink=Jack Copeland |author2=Copeland, Jack |author3=Proudfoot, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of an effective method involves more than the method itself. In order for a method to be called effective, it must be considered with respect to a class of problems. Because of this, one method may be effective with respect to one class of problems and ''not'' be effective with respect to a different class.

A method is formally called effective for a class of problems when it satisfies these criteria:
* It consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions.
* When it is applied to a problem from its class:
** It always finishes (''terminates'') after a finite number of steps.
** It always produces a correct answer.
* In principle, it can be done by a human without any aids except writing materials.
* Its instructions need only to be followed [[Rigour|rigorously]] to succeed. In other words, it requires no [[ingenuity]] to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''effective procedure''&lt;/ref&gt;

Optionally, it may also be required that the method never returns a result as if it were an answer when the method is applied to a problem from ''outside'' its class. Adding this requirement reduces the set of classes for which there is an effective method.

==Algorithms==
An effective method for calculating the values of a function is an [[algorithm]]. Functions for which an effective method exists are sometimes called '''effectively calculable'''.

==Computable functions==
Several independent efforts to give a formal characterization of effective calculability led to a variety of proposed definitions ([[Recursion|general recursion]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[λ-calculus]]) that later were shown to be equivalent. The notion captured by these definitions is known as [[Computable function|recursive or effective computability]].

The [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that the two notions coincide: any [[number-theoretic function]] that is effectively calculable is [[computable function|recursively computable]]. As this is not a mathematical statement, it cannot be proven by a [[mathematical proof]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20060">[[File:ResistorColorCodeGuide.jpg|thumb|RMA (Radio Manufacturers Association) Resistor Color Code Guide, ca. 1945–1955]]
[[Image:Resistor cropped.jpg|thumb|A 100&amp;nbsp;kΩ, 5% axial-lead resistor]]

An '''electronic color code''' is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for [[resistor]]s, but also for [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and others. A separate code, the [[25-pair color code]], is used to identify wires in some [[telecommunication]]s cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.

==History==
{{anchor|RMA|RTMA|RETMA|EIA|IEC}}
The electronic color code was developed in the early 1920s by the [[Radio Manufacturers Association]] (RMA), later the  [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] (RETMA), now part of the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA)&lt;ref name="JEDEC_EIA"/&gt; Therefore, the code was known as '''RMA''', '''RTMA''', '''RETMA''' or '''EIA color code'''. In 1952, it was standardized in [[IEC 62:1952]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and since 1963 also published as '''EIA RS-279'''.&lt;ref name="EIA_RS-279"/&gt; Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with [[IEC 62:1968]]. The code was adopted by many national standards like [[DIN 40825]] (1973), [[BS 1852]] (1974) and [[IS 8186]] (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is [[IEC 60062:2016]]&lt;ref name="IEC_60062_2016"/&gt; and [[EN 60062:2016]]. In addition to the color code, these standards define a [[letter and digit code]] for resistors and capacitors.

Color bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for [[Color blindness|color blind]] people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in [[surface mount]] packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.

==Resistor color-coding==
{{anchor|Resistor code}}
[[Image:2.26 kilo-ohm precision resistor.jpg|thumb|upright|A {{val|2260|ul=Ω}}, 1% precision resistor with 5 color bands ([[E96 series]]), from top 2-2-6-1-1; the last two brown bands indicate the multiplier (×10), and the 1% tolerance. The larger gap before the tolerance band is somewhat difficult to distinguish.]]
[[Image:Resistor bands.svg|A diagram of a resistor, with four color bands A, B, C, D from left to right]]
[[Image:4-Band Resistor.svg|A diagram of a 2.7&amp;nbsp;MΩ color-coded resistor.]]

To distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands.
{{ordered list
 | list-style-type=upper-alpha
 | The first significant figure of component value (left side)
 | The second significant figure (some precision resistors have a third significant figure, and thus five bands).
 | The decimal multiplier (number of trailing zeroes)
 | If present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no band means 20%)
}}

In the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and brown has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: {{val|2,700,000|u=ohms}}. Gold signifies that the tolerance is ±5%.

Resistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate ([[Reliability engineering|reliability]]); refer to [[MIL-HDBK]]-199&lt;ref name="MIL_HDBK_199C"/&gt; for further details.

Tight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating [[temperature coefficient]], in units of [[parts per million|ppm]]/[[Kelvin|K]].

All coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.

The standard color code per [[IEC 60062:2016]] is as follows:
{{Electronic colour code}}
[[Image:Preferred values 05 Pengo.svg|thumb|One decade of the [[E12 series]] (there are twelve preferred values per decade of values) shown with their electronic color codes on [[resistors]]]]
[[Image:0-ohm.jpg|thumb|A [[Zero-ohm link|0&amp;nbsp;Ω resistor]], marked with a single black band]]

Resistors use [[E-series of preferred numbers#Lists|various E-series of preferred numbers]] for their specific values, which are determined by their [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: ... 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, ... For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, ... is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by {{radic|10|6}}. For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with {{radic|10|12}} as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series {{nobr|10 + 20%}} is 12, while {{nobr|15 − 20%}} is also 12.

[[Zero ohm resistor]]s, marked with a single black band,&lt;ref name="NZO_NIC"/&gt; are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a [[printed-circuit board]] (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating "bridges" where two traces would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in [[Jumper (computing)|jumper]] wires for setting configurations.

The "body-end-dot" or "body-tip-spot" system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment; the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).&lt;ref name="FTRC_1946"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BTS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antique_Resistor"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Capacitor code}}Capacitor color-coding==
Capacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like [[resistor]]s.

Extra bands on ceramic capacitors identify the voltage rating class and temperature coefficient characteristics.&lt;ref name="FTRC_1946"/&gt; A broad black band was applied to some tubular paper capacitors to indicate the end that had the outer electrode; this allowed this end to be connected to chassis ground to provide some shielding against hum and noise pickup.

[[Polyester]] [[Film capacitor|film]] and "gum drop" [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] may also be color-coded to give the value, working voltage and tolerance.

=={{anchor|Inductor code}}Inductor color-coding==
Standards IEC&amp;nbsp;60062&amp;nbsp;/ EN&amp;nbsp;60062 do not define a color code for [[inductor]]s, but various manufacturers of physically small inductors utilize the resistor color code for this purpose, typically encoding [[inductance]] in microhenries.&lt;ref name="TDK_Inductors"/&gt; A white tolerance ring may indicate custom specifications.&lt;ref name="TDK_Inductors"/&gt;

==Diode part number==
The part number for small [[JEDEC]] "1N"-coded diodes—in the form "1N4148"—is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the "1N" prefix. The [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).

==Postage stamp capacitors and war standard coding==
[[File:EIA Capacitor Color Codes.jpg|thumb|Postage-stamp [[mica capacitor]]s marked with the EIA 3-dot and 6-dot color codes, giving capacitance value, tolerance, working voltage, and temperature characteristic. This style of capacitor was used in vacuum-tube equipment.]]
Capacitors of the rectangular "postage stamp" form made for military use during World War II used ''American War Standard'' (AWS) or ''[[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|Joint Army Navy]]'' (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN [[mica capacitor|mica]], or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for {{val|±1000|u=ppm/°C}}, brown for ±500, red for ±200, orange for ±100, yellow for −20 to +100&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C, and green for 0 to +70&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C.

A similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in [[vacuum tube]] equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.&lt;ref name="ARRL77"/&gt;

==Mnemonics==
{{Further|List of electronic color code mnemonics}}
A useful [[mnemonic]] matches the first letter of the color code, in numeric order. Here are two that includes tolerance codes gold, silver, and none:

* '''B'''ad '''b'''eer '''r'''ots '''o'''ur '''y'''oung '''g'''uts '''b'''ut '''v'''odka '''g'''oes '''w'''ell – '''g'''et '''s'''ome '''n'''ow.&lt;ref name="Campbell_BUCD"/&gt;
* '''B''' '''B''' '''ROY''' of '''G'''reat '''B'''ritain had a '''V'''ery '''G'''ood '''W'''ife who wore '''Gold''' and '''Silver''' '''N'''ecklace.

The colors are sorted in the order of the visible light spectrum: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Resistors color code.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Example color-coded resistors]]
From top to bottom:
* Green, blue, black, black, brown
** 560&amp;nbsp;ohms ±1%
* Red, red, orange, gold
** {{val|22000|u=ohms}} ±5%
* Yellow, violet, brown, gold
** 470&amp;nbsp;ohms ±5%
* Blue, grey, black, gold
** 68&amp;nbsp;ohms ±5%

The physical size of a resistor is indicative of the [[power (physics)|power]] it can dissipate.

There is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:
*Red, red, ''orange'' = ''22'' followed by ''3'' zeroes = 220,00 (excluding default, silver, or gold tolerance)
*Red, red, ''black'', ''red'' = ''220'' followed by ''2'' zeroes = 22,000 (excluding brown or other band for tolerance)

==Transformer wiring color codes==
Power [[transformer]]s used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the [[center tap]] for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.

Audio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.&lt;ref name="ARRL77"/&gt;

==Other wiring codes==
Wires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.

[[Building wiring]] under the US [[National Electrical Code]] and the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is identified by colors to show energized and neutral conductors, grounding conductors and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.

Mains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.

[[Thermocouple]] wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.

Automotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing [[SAE International|SAE]] and [[DIN]] standards exist.

Modern [[personal computer]] peripheral cables and connectors are color-coded to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to the [[PC connector colors|PC99 scheme]].

A common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket – AC less than {{val|1000|u=volts|fmt=commas}}, blue jacket – DC or communications, orange jacket – medium voltage {{val|2300|fmt=commas}} or {{val|4160|u=V|fmt=commas}}, red jacket {{val|13800|u=V|fmt=commas}} or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage [[fire alarm]] wiring, but has a much different appearance.

Local area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.

The '''European Master in Management''' (EMM) is a 2-year general management master program run jointly by [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (France), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (Germany) and [[Lancaster University Management School]] (UK). The purpose of the program is to allow students to study international business from a European and global perspective.

The European Master in Management is '''''a triple master's degree based in the France, Germany and the UK'''''. After completing all program requirements, '''''students are awarded three [[Master of Science|MSc]] Diplomas: one from each of the Partner Universities'''''. The EMM was the first European triple-degree program.

The objective of the EMM is to prepare students for a wide range of career possibilities all focused on global business through a combination of academic periods on different campuses, in-company internships, and a unique multicultural European experience with a great diversity in the student body. The first year is devoted to general management courses, whereas the second year is dedicated to a specialization in [[Corporate finance|Corporate Finance]], [[Marketing]], Strategy &amp; Change or [[Corporate development|Corporate Development]].

When the program was launched, in 2007, [[Aston Business School]] was the program's Partner University in the UK. After Aston Business School left the partnership, the program was run as a double degree master from EMLYON Business School and Ludwig Maximilian Universität (Germany) until Lancaster University Management School joined the partnership, bringing it back to a triple degree program.

==Program==

In the first year, students stay on the same campus ([[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]]) and are provided with a broad foundation of management knowledge. Each fundamental management course gives students a broader perspective of global business, as it is designed and taught jointly by a team of professors from [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU]] and [[Lancaster University Management School|LUMS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/classes-teaching-methods&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second year, students take on an elective specialisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Content/Specialisations&lt;/ref&gt; This is an opportunity to study at a new campus, depending on the specialization chosen:
* [[Corporate Finance]] at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon or at the Asian Campus in Shanghai)
* Marketing at [[École de management de Lyon|EMLYON Business School]] (at the European Campus in Lyon)
* Strategy &amp; Change at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian Universität]] (at the campus in Munich)
* Corporate Development at [[Lancaster University Management School]] (at the campus in Lancaster)

Students spend at least one semester in a company, on a management internship, and must write a professionally oriented Master's Dissertation. This provides the opportunity to strengthen relations with the business world.

==European Master in Management Partners Companies==

Throughout the year, students have multiple opportunities to contact with the corporate partners. Different companies are frequently represented on campus, either to give lectures and seminars or to offer internship and job opportunities directly to the students.

Some of the main partner companies are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-master.com/Careers-Network/partner-companies&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7397">'''Aletheic relativism''' argues that truth itself is relative. This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed. This problem centers on what Mandelbaum (1962) termed the "self-excepting fallacy." Largely because of the self-excepting fallacy, few authors in the philosophy of science currently accept aletheic cognitive relativism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muncy|first=James A.|last2=Fisk|first2=Raymond P.|date=1987|title=Cognitive Relativism and the Practice of Marketing Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1251141|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=51|issue=1|pages=20–33|doi=10.2307/1251141}}&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Factual relativism''' (also called '''epistemic relativism''', '''epistemological relativism''', '''alethic relativism''' or '''cognitive relativism''') is a way to [[reasoning|reason]] where [[fact]]s used to [[theory of justification|justify]] any [[proposition|claim]]s are understood to be [[relativism|relative]] and [[subjectivism|subjective]] to the perspective of those [[evidence|proving]] or [[falsify]]ing the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Einheuser, [http://www.ub.edu/grc_logos/archive/conferences/relativismabouttruth/Abstract5(Einheuser).pdf "Varieties of Relativism: Indexical, Propositional and Factual"], from the Logos conference on RELATIVIZING UTTERANCE TRUTH, Barcelona, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
One school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s comments in ''[[Against Method]]'' that "The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing" and "First-world science is one science among many" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|title=Against method|date=1992|publisher=Verso|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780860916468|page=3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously.

The [[strong program]] in the [[sociology of science]] is (in the words of founder [[David Bloor]]) "impartial with respect to truth and falsity".&lt;ref name="Philosophy Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=PhilosophyScience2|url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/philosophyscience2.htm|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Bloor and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] have said "For the relativist [such as us] there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationality and relativism|date=1982|publisher=MIT press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262580618|pages=27–28|editor1=Hollis, Martin |editor2=Lukes, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Bruno Latour]] has claimed that "Since the settlement of a controversy is the ''cause'' of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome&amp;nbsp;– Nature&amp;nbsp;– to explain how and why a controversy has been settled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=Science in action : how to follow scientists and engineers through society|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674792913|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper ''Le Soir'' that "There is no transcendent truth. [...] It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|title=Fashionable nonsense&amp;nbsp;: postmodern intellectuals' abuse of science|date=1998|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=9781466862401|page=100|author2=Bricmont, Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science Gérard Fourez wrote in that "What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question."&lt;ref&gt;Fourez, Gérard (1992). ''La Construction des sciences, 2eme edition revue''. Brussels:De Boeck Université.&lt;/ref&gt;

British archaeologist Roger Anyon told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "science is just one of many ways of knowing the world...  The [[Zuni people|Zuni]]'s world view is just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Johnson (writer)|Johnson, George]].  [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/22/science/indian-tribes-creationists-thwart-archeologists.html?scp=1 Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Cognitive relativism is unfalsifiable and has been criticized by both [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] and [[Science|scientists]].

Cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' has advocated [[model-dependent realism]], which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of [[M-Theory]].

[[Larry Laudan]]'s book ''Science and Relativism''&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Relativism: Dialogues on the Philosophy of Science'', {{ISBN|978-0-226-46949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">In the [[Bible]], the word "'''flesh'''" is often used simply as a description of the [[Flesh|fleshy]] parts of an animal, including that of human beings, and typically in reference to dietary laws and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="degruyter"&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/view/EBR/MainLemma_41781?pi=0&amp;moduleId=common-word-wheel&amp;dbJumpTo=flesh "Flesh, from the Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception"] DeGruyter (Berlin, Boston) 2014. Retrieved on 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less often it is used as a metaphor for familial or [[kinship]] relations, and (particularly in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition) as a metaphor to describe [[sin|sinful]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/encyclopedia/isb/view.cgi?n=3456 "International Standard Bible Encyclopedia - Flesh"]&lt;/ref&gt; A related turn of phrase identifies certain sins as "carnal" sins, from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:caro|caro, carnis]]'', meaning "flesh."  

== Etymology ==
{{Wiktionary}}
The word '''flesh''' (from the Old English ''flǣsc'', of Germanic origin) is translated from the Hebrew lexemes bāśār and šĕēr, and from the Greek σάρξ (sárx), and κρέας (kréas).&lt;ref name="degruyter" /&gt; 

== Meaning and Use ==

=== Old Testament ===
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''the way of all flesh'' is a religious phrase that in its original sense meant [[death]], the [[fate]] of all [[Living being|living things]]. This phrase does not appear verbatim in the King James Bible either, but is clearly prefigured in that translation:
: ''And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.'' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:13)

[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], by contrast, used ''[[The Way of All Flesh (novel)|The Way of All Flesh]]'' as the title of a semi-autobiographical [[family saga]], using the phrase to refer ambiguously to either the religious or to a [[Sex|sexual]] sense.

=== New Testament ===
[[File:Bernardino_Pinturicchio_-_Saint_Jerome_in_the_Wilderness_-_Walters_371089.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Saint Jerome in the Desert (Pinturicchio)|Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'' The saint spent four years in the Syrian desert as a hermit, [[Mortification of the flesh|mortifying]] his flesh and elevating his spirit through study.]]

[[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] makes this connection in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7:18, in which he says:
:''For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.'' ([[KJV]])

However, the (fourth century) [[Apostles' creed]] affirms 'carnis resurrectionem' (the resurrection of the flesh), the body being an essential part of a person.

In religious language, the "flesh" took on specific connotations of sexual sins.  It was in this sense that the nineteenth century critic [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] condemned a ''[[Fleshly School|Fleshly School of Poetry]]'', accusing [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], and [[William Morris|Morris]] with preoccupation with sex and sensual matters.

A traditional turn of phrase condemns "the [[World (theology)|world]], the flesh, and the [[Devil]]" as the sources of [[temptation]] to [[sin]]. This specific phrase does not appear in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]], but a similar sense appears in passages such as [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 2:16:

:''For all that is in the world, the [[lust]] of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the [[pride]] of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.'' (KJV)

The phrase definitely appears in the writings of [[Abelard]], who writes that "there are three things that tempt us: the world, the flesh, and the devil."&lt;ref&gt;''Tria autem sunt quae nos tentant, caro, mundus, diabolus.'' Abelard, ''[http://www.abaelard.de/abaelard/050511expositio.htm Exposition of the Lord's Prayer]'', sixth petition ("And lead us not in temptation")&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[litany]] of the 1662 edition of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' contains the petition:

:''From fornication, and all other deadly sin; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Spare us, good Lord.'''''

and the English translations of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] litanies often contain a similar petition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulcanhammer.org/anglican/bcp-1662.pdf ''Book of Common Prayer''], 1662 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional turn of phrase gave rise to the title of ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'', a 1959 apocalyptic science fiction film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">'''Floyd's triangle''' is a [[right angle|right-angled]] [[triangle|triangular]] array of [[natural number]]s, used in computer science education. It is named after [[Robert Floyd]]. It is defined by filling the rows of the triangle with consecutive numbers, starting with a 1 in the top left corner:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16939">A '''fundamental ephemeris''' of the [[Solar System]] is a [[Computer simulation|model]] of the objects of the system in space, with all of their positions and motions accurately represented. It is intended to be a high-precision primary reference for prediction and observation of those positions and motions, and which provides a basis for further refinement of the model. It is generally not intended to cover the entire life of the Solar System; usually a short-duration time span, perhaps a few centuries, is represented to high accuracy. Some long ephemerides cover several millennia to medium accuracy.

They are published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemeris]]. The latest releases include DE430 which covers planetary and lunar ephemeris from Dec 21, 1549 to Jan 25, 2650 with high precision and is intended for general use for modern time periods . DE431 was created to cover a longer time period Aug 15, -13200 to March 15, 17191 with slightly less precision for use with historic observations and far reaching forecasted positions.  DE432 was released as a minor update to DE430 with improvements to the Pluto barycenter in support of the [[New Horizons]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de432.pdf|title=JPL Memo IOM 392R-14-003|last=Folkner|first=|date=April 30, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The set of physical laws and numerical constants used in the calculation of the ephemeris must be self-consistent and precisely specified. The ephemeris must be calculated strictly in accordance with this set, which represents the most current knowledge of all relevant physical forces and effects. Current fundamental ephemerides are typically released with exact descriptions of all mathematical models, methods of computation, observational data, and adjustment to the observations at the time of their announcement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides DE405/LE405 |author=Standish |date=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062549/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}; {{cite web|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/inpop10a.pdf |title=INPOP10a |author=Fienga |display-authors=etal |date=2010 }}; {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |title=High-Precision Ephemerides of Planets—EPM and Determination of Some Astronomical Constants |author=Pitjeva |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031065523/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not have been the case in the past, as fundamental ephemerides were then computed from a collection of methods derived over a span of decades by many researchers.&lt;ref name="sandw"&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/ExplSupplChap8.pdf |author=Standish and Williams |title=CHAPTER 8: Orbital Ephemerides of the Sun, Moon, and Planets |date=2010}} A chapter from an as-yet-unpublished (Feb 2012) version of the ''Explanatory Supplement'' (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent variable of the ephemeris is always time. In the case of the most current ephemerides, it is a [[Coordinate time|relativistic coordinate time]] scale equivalent to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]].&lt;ref name="sandw" /&gt; In the past, [[Solar time|mean solar time]] (before the discovery of the non-uniform [[rotation of the Earth]]) and [[ephemeris time]] (before the implementation of [[Post-Newtonian expansion|relativistic gravitational equations]]) were used. The remainder of the ephemeris can consist of either the mathematical equations and initial conditions which describe the motions of the bodies of the Solar System, of tabulated data calculated from those equations and conditions, or of condensed mathematical representations of the tabulated data.

A fundamental ephemeris is the basis from which apparent ephemerides, phenomena, and orbital elements are computed for astronomical, nautical, and surveyors' almanacs. Apparent ephemerides give positions and motions of Solar System bodies as seen by observers from the surface of Earth, and are useful for astronomers, navigators, and surveyors in planning observations and in reducing the data acquired, although much of the work of latter two has been supplanted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology. Phenomena are events related to the configurations of Solar System bodies, for instance [[Sunrise|rise]] and [[Sunset|set]] times, [[Lunar phase|phases]], [[eclipse]]s and [[occultation]]s, and have many civil and scientific applications. [[Orbital elements]] are descriptions of the motion of a body at a particular instant, used for further short-time-span calculation of the body's position when high accuracy is not required.

==History==
Astronomers have been tasked with computing accurate ephemerides, originally for purposes of sea navigation, from at least the 18th century. In England, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in 1675,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory/history/ |title=History of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began publishing ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/na_history.php |title=History of The Nautical Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the ''[[Bureau des Longitudes]]'' was founded in 1795 to publish the ''[[Connaissance des Temps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcce.fr/en/presentation/histoire_imcce.php |title=History of the IMCCE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early fundamental ephemerides of these publications came from many different sources and authors as the science of [[celestial mechanics]] matured.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), chap. 7 or ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), chap. 13 for extensive lists of sources of the early fundamental ephemerides of the ''Nautical Almanac''. (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the analytical methods of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|general perturbations]] reached the probable limits of what could be accomplished by hand calculation.

From the mid 20th century, work began on [[numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion]] on [[IBM SSEC|early computing machines]] for purposes of producing fundamental ephemerides for the ''Astronomical Almanac''. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were based on the work of Eckert, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Eckert |author2=Brouwer |author3=Clemence |date=1951 |title=Coordinates of the Five Outer Planets 1953–2060 |series=Astronom.

The fundamental ephemeris of the Moon, always a difficult problem in celestial mechanics, remained a work-in-progress through the early 1980s. It was based originally on the work of Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nBFLAAAAYAAJ |author=Brown |date=1919 |title=Tables of the Motion of the Moon |publisher=Yale University Press, New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with updates and corrections by Clemence, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1952 |title=Aberration in the Lunar Ephemeris |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=57 |pages=46–47|bibcode=1952AJ.....57...46C |doi=10.1086/106703 |last1=Clemence |first1=G.

From 2003 onward (as of Feb 2012), [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|JPL's DE405/LE405]], an integrated ephemeris referred to the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]], has been used.&lt;ref name="sandw" /&gt; In France, the ''Bureau des Longitudes'' began using their machine-generated semi-analytical theory VSOP82 in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...114..278B |title=Théorie du mouvement de l'ensemble des planètes.

[[File:Body mass index chart.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Chart showing underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese|[[Body mass index]] chart]]
As of the early 21st century, [[Okinawa]]ns in [[Japan]], through practicing ''hara hachi bu'', are the only human population to have a self-imposed habit of calorie restriction.&lt;ref name=Okinawa /&gt; They consume about 1,800&lt;ref name=Grossman /&gt; to 1,900 kilo-calories per day.&lt;ref&gt;Beuttner, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Their elders' typical [[body mass index]] (BMI) is about 18 to 22, compared to a typical BMI of 26 or 27 for adults over 60 in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="BasicNutrition"&gt;{{cite book| author = Smolin LA|author2=Grosvenor MB| title = Basic Nutrition| year = 2004| publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]]| isbn = 0-7910-7850-7 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pqueMlren1cC&amp;pg=PA134 | pages = 134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Okinawa has the world's highest proportion of [[centenarian]]s, at approximately 50 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Okinawa's Centenarians|url=http://www.okicent.org/cent.html|work=The Okinawa Centenarian Study|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemist [[Clive McCay]], a professor at [[Cornell University]] in the 1930s, reported that significant [[calorie restriction]] prolonged life in laboratory animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ingram, DK|title=Development of calorie restriction mimetics as a prolongevity strategy|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2004|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|doi=10.1196/annals.1297.074 |display-authors=etal|volume=1019|pages=412–423|pmid=15247056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/pdf_guides/RMA01087.pdf|format=PDF|title=Clive McCay papers, 1920-1967 | publisher = [[Cornell University Library]] | accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors Bradley and Craig Wilcox and Makoto Suzuki believe that ''hara hachi bu'' may act as a form of calorie restriction, thus extending practitioners' [[life expectancy]].  They believe ''hara hachi bun me'' assists in keeping the average Okinawan's BMI low, and this is thought to be due to the delay in the stomach stretch receptors that help signal [[Hunger (motivational state)|satiety]]. The result of not practising ''hara hachi bun me'' is a constant stretching of the stomach which in turn increases the amount of food needed to feel full.&lt;ref name=Okinawa /&gt;

==Influence==
In the 1965 book ''[[Philip Kapleau#Writings|Three Pillars of Zen]]'', the author quotes [[Hakuun Yasutani]] in his lecture for [[zazen]] beginners as telling his students about the book ''Zazen Yojinki'' (''Precautions to Observe in Zazen''), written circa 1300, which advises practitioners to eat about two-thirds of their capacity. Yasutani advises his students to eat only eighty percent of their capacity, and he repeats a Japanese proverb: “eight parts of a full stomach sustain the man; the other two sustain the doctor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Kapleau| first1 = Philip| title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment| year = 1989| publisher = Anchor Books| location = New York| isbn = 0-385-26093-8| pages = 43–44| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hara hachi bun me'' was popularized in the United States by a variety of modern books on diet and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Buettner, pp. 83, 96, 103, 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Beckerman| first = James| title = The Flex Diet| year = 2011| publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Touchstone]]| isbn = 978-1-4391-5569-1| pages = 162–163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE]] P1906.1''' - Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=IEEE Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=7378262|journal=IEEE Std 1906.1-2015|pages=1–64|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2016.7378262}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standards working group sponsored by the [[IEEE Communications Society]] Standards Development Board whose goal is to develop a common framework for [[nanoscale networking|nanoscale]] and [[molecular communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/1906.1.html IEEE P1906.1 - Recommended Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework]&lt;/ref&gt; Because this is an [[emerging technology]], the standard is designed to encourage innovation by reaching consensus on a common definition, terminology, framework, goals, metrics, and use-cases that encourage innovation and enable the technology to advance at a faster rate. The draft passed an initial sponsor balloting with comments on January 2, 2015. The comments were addressed by the working group and the resulting draft ballot passed again on August 17, 2015. Finally, additional material regarding [[SBML]] was contributed and the final draft passed again on October 15, 2015. The draft standard was approved by IEEE RevCom in the final quarter of 2015.

== Membership ==

[[Working group]] membership includes experts in industry and academia with strong backgrounds in [[mathematical modeling]], [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[economics]] and [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mentor.ieee.org/1906.1/bp/StartPage IEEE COM/Nanoscale and Molecular Communications Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Electronic components such as [[transistors]], or [[electrical]]/[[Radio propagation|electromagnetic]] message carriers whose operation is similar at the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscale]] and [[nanoscale]] are excluded from the definition. A human-engineered, [[Artificiality|synthetic]] component must form part of the system because it is important to avoid standardizing nature or physical processes. The definition of [[communication]], particularly in the area of [[cell-surface]] interactions as viewed by [[biologist]]s versus non-biologists has been a topic of debate. The interface is viewed as a [[communication channel]], whereas the '[[Cell signaling|receptor-signaling]]-[[gene expression]]' events are the network.
 
The draft currently comprises: definition, terminology, framework, metrics, use-cases, and reference code ([[Ns (simulator)|ns-3]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bush, S.; Paluh, J.; Piro, G.; Rao, V.; Prasad, V.; Eckford, A., [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2015.2465513 "Defining Communication at the Bottom,"] in Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications, IEEE Transactions on, vol.PP, no.99, pp.1-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard provides a very broad foundation and encompasses all approaches to nanoscale communication. While there have been many superficial academic attempts to classify nanoscale communication approaches, the standard considers two fundamental approaches: [[Wave–particle duality|waves and particles]]. This includes any hybrid of the two as well as [[quasiparticle]]s.

A unique contribution of the standard is an [[ns-3]] reference model that enables users to build upon the standard components.

=== Definition ===
*	A precise definition of [[nanoscale networking]] 
**	[[Academic]] and [[Industry|industrial]] researchers have been playing with the concept of nanoscale communication networks, but without a common, well-defined, and precise definition. The IEEE P1906.1 working group has adopted the definitive specification for a nanoscale communication network. The draft standard sets the context of communication within [[length scale]]s by defining communication length scales  ranging from the [[Planck length]] scale to [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] length scales. A focus is upon the progression of physical changes that impact communication as [[length scale]] is reduced.

=== Terminology ===
*	Common terminology for nanoscale networking
**	Nanoscale communication networking is a highly [[interdisciplinary]] endeavor. A clear, common language is required so that interdisciplinary researchers can work smoothly together and minimize cross-discipline misunderstanding due to the common definitions that are defined differently in different fields. The P1906.1 working group has reached consensus on common definitions unique to nanoscale communication networks.

=== Framework ===
*	A framework for ad hoc nanoscale networking
**	There is a pressing need for a [[conceptual model]] of nanoscale networks. A standardized platform for nanoscale communication [[network simulation]] is needed. Researchers are developing simulation models and packages for components related to nanoscale communication networks; however the simulation components are not interoperable, even at a conceptual level. The IEEE P1906.1 working group has adopted a nanoscale communication framework that addresses this need. The result of the framework is known as the ''standard model.''

=== Metrics ===
*	Metrics and analytical model are in development
**	The working group is currently in the process of developing [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]s to uniquely characterize nanoscale communication networks.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, S.F.; Goel, S., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6708562&amp;isnumber=6704980 "Persistence Length as a Metric for Modeling and Simulation of Nanoscale Communication Networks,"] Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, vol.31, no.12, pp.815-824, December 2013 doi: 10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130014.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty metrics have been defined:
*** Message Deliverability 
*** Message Lifetime 
*** Information Density 
*** [[Bandwidth delay product|Bandwidth-Delay Product]]
*** Information and Communication Energy
*** [[Coefficient of restitution|Collision Behavior]]
*** Mass Displacement 
*** Positioning Accuracy of Message Carriers 
*** [[Persistence length|Persistence Length]]
*** [[Diffusion#Diffusion flux|Diffusive Flux]]
*** [[Langevin equation|Langevin Noise]]
*** [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]]
*** [[Relative binding affinity|Affinity]]
*** [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]]
*** [[Angle of arrival|Angular (Angle-of-Arrival) Spectrum]]
*** [[Time of arrival|Delay (Time-of-Arrival) Spectrum]]
*** [[Active networking|Active Network Programmability]]
*** Perturbation Rate 
*** Supersystem Degradation 
*** Bandwidth-Volume Ratio

=== Use-Cases ===
* Specific example applications of the standard
** Specific [[Use case|use-case]]s of nanoscale communication implemented using the P1906.1 definition and framework are provided. A standard mapping between a use-case, or implementation, and the standard model of the framework allows a brief summary of the information required about a use-case to understand its relevance to a nanoscale communication network.

=== Reference model ===
*	Reference code to model the recommended practice is in development
**	[[Ns-3]] reference code is currently in development that implements the developing IEEE P1906.1 recommended practice. The communication framework conceived by the P1906.1 working group has been implemented. A simple example highlighting the interaction and the role of each component in [[electromagnetic]]-based,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/master/p1906/model-em 1906 NS-3 Electromagnetic Model]&lt;/ref&gt; [[diffusion]]-based,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/master/p1906/model-mol 1906 NS-3 Diffusion Model]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[molecular motor]]-based communication&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev/tree/motor-model 1906 NS-3 Molecular Motor Model]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[nanoscale]] has been developed.

== Applications ==
Applications are numerous, however, there appears to be strong emphasis on medical and biological use-cases in [[nanomedicine]].

== Simulation software ==
The IEEE P1906.1 working group is developing [[ns-3]] nanoscale simulation software that implements the IEEE 1906.1 standard and serves as a reference model and base for development of a wide-variety of interoperable small-scale communication physical layer models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code 1906 NS-3 Electromagnetic Model]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature review ==
The Best Readings on nanoscale communication networks provides good background information related to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comsoc.org/blog/discover-best-readings-nanoscale-communication-networks DISCOVER THE BEST READINGS IN NANOSCALE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Topics section breaks down the information using the standard approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comsoc.org/best-readings/topics/nanoscale-communication-networks#topics BEST READINGS TOPICS ON NANOSCALE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building on IEEE 1906.1 ==
IEEE 1906.1 is the foundation for nanoscale communication. Additional standards are expected to build upon it. 

'''IEEE 1906.1.1 Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems '''
The Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems defines a [[network management]] and configuration [[data model]] for nanoscale communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/1906.1.1.html IEEE 1906.1.1 - Standard Data Model for Nanoscale Communication Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
This data model has several goals:
* Ensure compliance with IEEE 1906.1-2015
* Describe the essence of nanoscale communication
* Capture fundamental physics of IEEE 1906.1-2015
* Define configuration and management of simulation and experimental systems
* Provide a self-describing data structure for experimental data.

The data model is written in [[YANG]] and will enable remote remote configuration and operation of nanoscale communication over the Internet using [[NETCONF]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''ISC3 (Industrial Source Complex)''' model is a popular steady-state [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Gaussian plume model]] which can be used to assess pollutant concentrations from a wide variety of sources associated with an industrial complex.

This model can account for the following: 
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Point, area, line, and volume sources]]
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Settling and dry deposition of particles]] 
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Downwash]] 
* Separation of point sources
* Limited terrain adjustment

ISC3 operates in both [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|long-term and short-term]] modes. The screening version of ISC3 is [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Screening models|SCREEN3]].

Very recently, the status of ISC3 as a [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Preferred and recommended models|Preferred/Recommended Model]] of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] has been withdrawn, but it can still be used as an alternative to the Preferred/Recommended models in regulatory applications with case-by-case justification to the reviewing authority.

== Input data ==

ISC short term version required two sets of data: source data and hourly averaged [[meteorological]] data:

=== Source data ===

* Dimensions of the source
* [[Air pollution|Emission]] discharge rate
* Release height of the emission source

=== Meteorological data ===

* Ambient temperature, K
* Wind direction
* Wind speed, m/s
* Atmospheric [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability classes]] (A through F, entered as  1 through 6)
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Urban and rural]] mixing height, m

== Ecological field project consultancies ==
The Institute is involved in a series of ecological demonstration projects, selected in challenging biomes facing ecological degradation and cultural conflict. These were chosen because conventional approaches do not work, requiring innovative, "ecotechic" approaches with the goals of ecological upgrade, economic sustainability and to develop the capabilities of I.E. members and associates. The projects, and the Heraclitus, are places where hands-on educational programsand volunteer opportunities are provided.

Synergia Ranch, started in 1969, was the Institute's first ecological field project. There on 130 acres of desertifying high altitude sem-arid juniper/pinon grasslands, I.E. developed a program to restore the land, with the goal of creating an oasis in the desert. Over a thousand trees were planted, including 450 fruit trees, organic vegetable gardens and an extensive soil-building program using compost to restore lost fertility to an area which had been overgrazed and cleared for inappropriate broad-acre farming in the 1920s. Adobe buildings and a geodesic dome were built and artisan enterprises started including pottery, woodworking, iron working, clothing, leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wastewater Gardener: Preserving the Planet One Flush at a Time|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=Synergetic Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0907791515|location=Santa Fe, NM|pages=Chapter 2, Flower Power at Synergia Ranch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A construction firm build some three dozen adobe buildings in Santa Fe, contributing to a renaissance of traditional adobe architecture. The orchards and vegetable gardens are certified organic and in 2016 Synergia Ranch won the Good Earth award at the New Mexico Organic Agriculture conference in recognition of its land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://farmersmarketinstitute.org/news-and-events/synergia-ranch-good-earth-award/|title=Synergia Ranch Good Earth Award|last=Alexis|first=|date=February 23, 2017|website=Santa Fe Farmers Market Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecotechnic life style approach was to balance by engaging in three lines of work: ecology, enterprise and theater. The Theater of All Possibilities was based at Synergia Ranch for over a decade.

Les Marronniers near Aix-en-Provence, France, begun in 1976 is the ecotechnic field project in the Mediterranean biome. It has also served as a frequent location for the international conferences which I.E. organizes bringing together scientists, artists, engineers, managers and thinkers to engage on topics of broad interest. Les Marronniers has also revivified on 7 ha (17 acres) the mixed agriculture small holdings traditional in the area, with orchard, grapes, field crops, woodlot, domestic animals and art/sculpture workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecotechnics.edu/2011/02/les-marronniers-southern-france/|title=Les Marronniers Southern France|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute of Ecotechnics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwood Downs, a 4300 acre property in the Kimberley region of NW Western Australia, is the Institute's tropical savannah biomic project. Established in 1978, its goals are to regenerate an overgrazed ecology dominated by invasive scrub trees with drought-resistant grasses and legumes and to demostrate ecotechnic ways of living within a sometimes harsh climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Conceptual Model for Synergetic Management of the Savannahs, in Tothill, J.C. and Mott, J, eds.

Recognizing that cities, part of the anthropogenic urban biome, are crucial players in the biosphere, I.E. helped establish the [[October Gallery]] in London in 1979 as its world city project. The October Gallery's goal is to find and showcase cutting-edge artists of the "transvangarde" from around the world. It also supports a robust educational program bringing many London school children into the gallery to meet artists and make art, as well as traveling exhibitions. Designed as a place where science and art can interact, it also hosts scientific, cultural and musical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/|title=October Gallery: Contemporary Art from Around the Planet|last=|first=|date=|website=October Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Las Casas de la Selva project in Patillas, Puerto Rico became I.E. tropical rainforest project. On almost 1000 acres of mountainous secondary forest, the goal of the project is to show innovative methods of forest enrichment and to promote sustainable tropical forestry. With the cooperation of Puerto Rican departments of development and forestry, some 40,000 seedlings of valuable timber species were planted on one-third of the land. Line-planting was employed to minimize the impact on the surrounding forest and to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=The Impact of Hardwood Line-Planting on Tree and Amphibian Biodiversity in a Secondary Wet Tropical Forest,  Southeast Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Journal of Sustainable Forestry|volume=(2010) 29(5)|pages=503–516|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Mark|last2=et. al.|date=|title=Enriched secondary subtropical forest through line-planting for sustainable timber production in Puerto Rico|url=|journal=Bois et Forêts des Tropiques|volume=(November 2011) 309(3)|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas won the 2016 Energy Globe national award for Puerto Rico and is recovering from severe damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Biosphere 2 project was the subject of much media attention, and there were allegations that this was not science but a stunt, and that the project had been a failure. Some of the controversy may have stemmed from the radical goals of the project - to develop methods of harmonizing its technosphere and living systems including a non-polluting, non-toxic farming, a challenge to business as usual which is damaging the Earth's biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pushing our Limits: Insights from Biosphere 2|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2018|isbn=0816537321|location=Tucson AZ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it fell into the contentious divide between analytic (reductionist) and integrative (holistic) science though the project employed both to create the world's first mini biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=John|last2=et. al.|date=2003|title=The legacy of Biosphere 2 for the study of biospherics and closed ecological systems|url=|journal=Advances in Space Research|volume=31 |issue=7|pages=1629–1640|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations have been strenuously denied and refuted by some of those involved, including ecologist and author [[Mark Nelson (scientist)|Mark Nelson]], the chairman of the Institute of Ecotechnics and a Biosphere 2 crew member from 1991–1993, and Bill Dempster, the Biosphere 2 Director of Systems Engineering until 1994.&lt;ref name="Motherboard 2"&gt;{{cite web

'''The Kavli Institute for Cosmology''', [[Cambridge]] ('''KICC''') is a research establishment set up through collaboration of the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|Kavli Foundation]]. It is operated by two of the University's astronomy groups: the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] (IoA) and the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]].

==Background==
In August 2006 an agreement was reached between the University of Cambridge and the Kavli Foundation for the establishment of an Institute for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavlifoundation.org/kavli-news/university-cambridge-and-kavli-foundation-create-pioneering-new-research-center-examine-v| title=The University of Cambridge and The Kavli Foundation Create a Pioneering New Research Center to Examine the Very Beginnings of the Universe| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=1 November 2006| work=Kavli News |publisher=The Kavli Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kavli Foundation will support several 5-year senior research fellowships in perpetuity, and the University committed to provide a building to house the Institute. Operation began in October 2008 with the appointment of the first Kavli Institute Fellows. The building was completed in July 2009, and was officially opened 18 November 2009 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor of the University]] in a ceremony with [[Fred Kavli]].

The director of the Institute is Roberto Maiolino; the deputy director is Anthony Challinor. The first director was [[George Efstathiou]] of the IoA.

==Projects==
KICC researchers are involved in the following projects:

* [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]]
* [[Dark Energy Survey]]
* [[Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument]]
* [[Extremely Large Telescope]]
* [[Illustris project]]
* [[James Webb Space Telescope]]
* KLEVER (Kmos LEnsed Velocity and Emission line Review)
* [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]]
* MaNGA sky survey
* MOONS galaxy survey
* Planck cosmological survey
* [[Square Kilometre Array]]
* [[Simons Observatory]]

==Kavli Building==

The Kavli Building is located adjacent to the Hoyle Building, the main building of the IoA. The two are connected via a raised walkway. The building was designed to encourage the occupants to interact with one another as well as with the occupants of the Hoyle building. It is intended to be similar in architectural style to the Hoyle Building, but to be sufficiently distinctive so as to retain an independent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarch.co.uk/architecture/kavli-institute-cosmology-cambridge| title=Kavli Institute: Architecture| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=2008|publisher=Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects were Annand and Mustoe. The design includes use of ground source heat pumps and a heat exchanger serving under-floor heating to meet [[Cambridge City Council|City Council]] requirements that at least 10% of the building's energy is generated on-site.

The '''Murchison meteorite''' is a large [[meteorite]] that fell to earth near [[Murchison, Victoria]], in Australia, in 1969. It is one of the most studied meteorites due to its mass (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;kg), the fact that it was an observed [[Meteorite fall|fall]], and that it belongs to a group of meteorites rich in [[organic compound]]s.

==History==
On 28 September 1969 at about 10:58 am local time, near the town of [[Murchison, Victoria]], in Australia, a bright [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] was observed to separate into three fragments before disappearing,&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; leaving a cloud of smoke. About 30 seconds later, a tremor was heard. Many fragments were found over an area larger than {{convert|13|km²}}, with individual mass up to {{convert|7|kg}}; one, weighing {{convert|680|g|lb|1}}, broke through a roof and fell in hay.&lt;ref name="database" /&gt; The total collected mass exceeds {{convert|100|kg|-1}}.

==Classification and composition==
The meteorite belongs to the CM group of [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s (see [[meteorite classification]]). Like most CM chondrites, Murchison is [[Chondrite#Petrologic types|petrologic type 2]], which means that it experienced extensive alteration by water-rich fluids on its parent body&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Airieau |first1=S.

Murchison contains common [[amino acid]]s such as [[glycine]], [[alanine]] and [[glutamic acid]] as well as unusual ones like [[isovaline]] and [[leucines|pseudoleucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for extraterrestrial amino-acids and hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite |last=Kvenvolden |first=Keith A. |last2=Lawless |first2=James |last3=Pering |first3=Katherine |last4=Peterson |first4=Etta |last5=Flores |first5=Jose |last6=Ponnamperuma |first6=Cyril |last7=Kaplan |first7=Isaac R. |last8=Moore |first8=Carleton |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=228 |issue=5275 |pages=923–926 |date=1970 |url=http://chemport.cas.org/cgi-bin/sdcgi?APP=ftslink&amp;action=reflink&amp;origin=npg&amp;version=1.0&amp;coi=1:CAS:528:DyaE3MXisVCnsg%3D%3D&amp;pissn=0028-0836&amp;pyear=1983&amp;md5=cb8b015f54156458fa2be8cdca44789f |doi=10.1038/228923a0 |pmid=5482102 |bibcode=1970Natur.228..923K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex mixture of [[alkane]]s was isolated as well, similar to that found in the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. [[Serine]] and [[threonine]], usually considered to be earthly contaminants, were conspicuously absent in the samples. A specific family of amino acids called [[diamino acid]]s was identified in the Murchison meteorite as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identification of diamino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Meierhenrich |first=Uwe J. |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=101 |pages=9182–9186 |date=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0403043101 |pmid=15194825 |issue=25 |pmc=438950 |bibcode=2004PNAS..101.9182M |last2=Bredehöft |first2=Jan Hendrik |last3=Jessberger |first3=Elmar K. |last4=Thiemann |first4=Wolfram H.-P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial report stated that the amino acids were [[racemic]] and therefore formed in an abiotic manner because amino acids of terrestrial proteins are all of the L-configuration. Later the amino acid [[alanine]], which is also a protein amino acid, was found to have an excess of the L-configuration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Distribution and enantiomeric composition of amino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Engel |first=Michael H. |last2=Nagy |first2=Bartholomew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=296 |pages=837–840 |date=29 April 1982 |doi=10.1038/296837a0 |issue=5860 |bibcode=1982Natur.296..837E }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led several to suspect terrestrial contamination according to the argument that it would be "unusual for an abiotic stereoselective decomposition or synthesis of amino acids to occur with protein amino acids but not with non-protein amino acids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the reported optical activity of amino acids in the Murchison meteorite |last=Bada |first=Jeffrey L. |last2=Cronin |first2=John R. |last3=Ho |first3=Ming-Shan |last4=Kvenvolden |first4=Keith A. |last5=Lawless |first5=James G. |last6=Miller |first6=Stanley L. |last7=Oro |first7=J. |last8=Steinberg |first8=Spencer |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=301 |pages=494–496 |date=10 February 1983 |doi=10.1038/301494a0 |issue=5900 |bibcode=1983Natur.301..494B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, L-excesses were also found in a non-protein amino acid, [[isovaline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=John R. |last2=Pizzarello |first2=S. |title=Enantiomeric excesses in meteoritic amino acids |journal=Science |date=1997 |volume=275 |pages=951–955 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5302.951 |pmid=9020072 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/275/5302/951.full |issue=5302|bibcode = 1997Sci...275..951C }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting an extraterrestrial source for molecular asymmetry in the Solar System.

Although the meteorite contained a mixture of left-handed and right-handed amino acids, most amino acids used by living organisms are left-handed in [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|chirality]], and most sugars used are right-handed. A team of chemists in Sweden demonstrated in 2005 that this [[homochirality]] could have been triggered or [[catalyzed]], by the action of a left-handed amino acid such as [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates |last=Córdova |first=Armando |last2=Engqvist |first2=Magnus |last3=Ibrahem |first3=Ismail |last4=Casas |first4=Jesús |last5=Sundén |first5=Henrik |journal=[[Chem.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the interior portions of well-preserved fragments from Murchison are pristine.

'''Ocean Way Recording''' was{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} the name of a series of [[recording studio]]s located in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Originally known as a two-building complex in Hollywood called [[United Western Recorders]], the United site was sold to Allen Sides, who renamed it to Ocean Way Recording in 1988.

In 1999, the building located at 6050 [[Sunset Boulevard]] was partitioned and sold as [[EastWest Studios]]. Ocean Way retained the other building and continued to operate on 6000 Sunset Boulevard. In 2015, it was sold and renamed to [[United Recording Studios]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Background==
{{Main|United Western Recorders}}
The original [[United Western studios]], constructed in 1952, was the home of many major recording sessions in the 1960s and 1970s. [[Bill Putnam]], the original owner and partner, Jerry Barnes, sold the studio operations to Harman Industries along with UREI (United Recording Electrical Industries) in 1982. [[Allen Sides]] purchased the United property in 1988, and renamed it Ocean Way Recording. He had been leasing Studio B in United for 2 years previously.

In 1999, the original Ocean Way/Western Recorders facility at 6000 [[Sunset Blvd.]] was sold to Cello Recording Studios (now [[EastWest Studios]]), and Sides retained the building next door at 6050 Sunset Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanwayrecording.com/about-history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Two additional studios were later added to the Ocean Way Family; [[Record One]] studios in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California|Sherman Oaks]] in 1988, and Ocean Way/Nashville opened on [[Music Row]] in 1997. The Ocean Way Nashville facility was later sold to [[Belmont University]]. Ocean Way recording now carries on business at two locations - Hollywood and Sherman Oaks.

==Merchandise==
Ocean Way Audio manufactures and markets [[Allen Sides]]’ highly regarded monitor speaker systems. Ocean Way Drums, in partnership with producer [[Steven Miller (record producer)|Steven Miller]], is creating musical instrument plugins.

'''Paleofeces''' (UK: Palaeofaeces) are ancient [[human feces]], often found as part of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations or surveys.  The term [[coprolite]] is often used interchangeably. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions.  They are studied to determine the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[health]] of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. The feces can contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about  the material itself. They can also be chemically analyzed for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using [[lipid]] analysis and ancient [[DNA]] analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. This material is generally the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is as direct an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L., Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process that preserves the feces in a way such that they can be analyzed later is called the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Divining Diet and Disease From DNA. Erik Stokstad. Science 28 July 2000: 289 (5479), 530-531. [DOI:10.1126/science.289.5479.530]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of research==

Analysis of archaeological feces has a relatively short history compared to many other archaeological materials. The founder of the discipline is  Dr. Eric O. Callen, who pioneered the subject in the late 1950s to mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Archaeological coprolite science: The legacy of Eric O. Callen (1912–1970)|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.11.032|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018206001027|year=2013|last1=Bryant|first1= V.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=237|issue=1|pages=51–66}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His early papers used coprolite analysis to investigate early Mexican diets, published in The Prehistory of the Tehuacan Valley: Environment, and Subsistence. Despite his work showing promise, archaeological coprolite studies remained a niche topic, with few other researchers becoming involved. After Callen's sudden death in 1970, his work was continued by [http://anthropology.tamu.edu/html/profile--vaughnbryant.html Vaughn Bryant] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], Department of Anthropology. Coprolite analysis gradually became a topic of serious study. Today coprolite analysis in archaeology has increased exponentially, and they have provided important evidence concerning the evolution of human health and diet, in the Americas and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166|year=2011|last1=Shillito|first1= L-M.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1869–1877|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous examples is the coprolite from [[Paisley Caves]], Oregon, which has provided some of the earliest evidence for the human occupation of North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/786.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of analysis==

A wide variety of methods can be used to analyse ancient feces, ranging from microscopic to molecular. At a basic level the analysis of size and morphology can provide some information on whether they are likely to be human or from another animal. Analyzed contents can include those visible to the naked eye, such as seeds and other plant remains—to the microscopic, including pollen and phytoliths. Parasites in coprolites can give information on the living conditions and health of ancient populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981713000405 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.04.003 | volume=3 | title=Human intestinal parasites from a latrine in the 12th century Frankish castle of Saranda Kolones in Cyprus | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=218–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the molecular level, ancient [[DNA]] analysis can be used both to identify the species and to provide dietary information. A method using [[lipid]] analysis can also be used for species identification, based on the range of fecal [[sterols]] and [[bile acids]].&lt;ref&gt;http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/073/Ant0730086.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules vary between species according to gut biochemistry, and so can distinguish between humans and other animals.

An example of researchers using paleofeces for the gathering of information using DNA analysis occurred at Hinds Cave in Texas by Hendrik Poinar and his team. The fecal samples obtained were over 2,000 years old. From the samples, Poinar was able to gather DNA samples using the analysis methods recounted above. From his research Poinar found that the feces belonged to three Native Americans, based on mtDNA similarities to present day Native Americans. Poinar also found DNA evidence of the food they ate. There were samples of buckthorn, acorns, ocotillo, nightshade and wild tobacco. No visible remnants of these plants were visible in the fecal matter. Along with plant material, there were also DNA sequences of animal species such as bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope, both of which lack any evidence elsewhere in Hinds Cave, indicating that they were killed and consumed elsewhere.

This analysis of the diet was very helpful. Previously it was assumed that this population of Native Americans survived with berries being their main source of nutrients. From the paleofeces, it was determined that these assumptions were incorrect and in the approximately 2 days of food that are represented in a fecal sample, 2-4 animal species and 4-8 plant species were represented. The nutritional diversity of this archaic human population was rather extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al.

An example of the use of lipid analysis for identification of species is at the Neolithic site of [[Catalhoyuk]] in Turkey. Large midden deposits at the site are frequently found to contain fecal material &lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/turkey-neolithic-life-at-catalhoyuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; either as distinct coprolites or compressed 'cess pit' deposits. This was initially thought to be from dog on the basis of digested bone, however an analysis of the lipid profiles showed that many of the coprolites were actually from humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031 | volume=38 | title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | pages=1869–1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of parasites from fecal material within cesspits has provided evidence for health and migration in past populations. For example, the identification of fish tapeworm eggs in Acre in the Crusader period indicate that this parasite was transported from northern Europe. The parasite was rarely seen in the Levant area during this time but was common in Northern Europe. It is suggested that it was brought to the region by the incoming Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981711000337 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2011.10.005 | volume=1 | title=Human intestinal parasites in crusader Acre: Evidence for migration with disease in the medieval period | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parasitic computing''' is programming technique where a program in normal authorized interactions with another program manages to get the other program to perform computations of a complex nature. It is, in a sense, a security exploit in that the program implementing the parasitic computing has no authority to consume resources made available to the other program.

It was first proposed by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W. Freeh, Hawoong Jeong &amp; Jay B. Brockman from University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~parasite/ Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt; The example given by the original paper was two computers communicating over the [[Internet]], under disguise of a standard communications session. The first computer is attempting to solve a large and extremely difficult [[3-SAT]] problem; it has decomposed the original 3-SAT problem in a considerable number of smaller problems. Each of these smaller problems is then encoded as a relation between a [[checksum]] and a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] such that whether the checksum is accurate or not is also the answer to that smaller problem. The packet/checksum is then sent to another computer. This computer will, as part of receiving the packet and deciding whether it is valid and [[well-formed element|well-formed]], create a checksum of the packet and see whether it is identical to the provided checksum. If the checksum is invalid, it will then request a new packet from the original computer. The original computer now knows the answer to that smaller problem based on the second computer's response, and can transmit a fresh packet embodying a different sub-problem. Eventually, all the sub-problems will be answered and the final answer easily calculated.

The example is based on an exploit of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), used for internet connections, so in the end, the target computer(s) is unaware that it has performed computation for the benefit of the other computer, or even done anything besides have a normal [[TCP/IP]] session.

The proof-of-concept is obviously extremely inefficient as the amount of computation necessary to merely send the packets in the first place easily exceeds the computations leeched from the other program; and the 3-SAT problem would be solved much more quickly if just analyzed locally. In addition, in practice packets would probably have to be retransmitted occasionally when real checksum errors and network problems occur. However, parasitic computing on the level of checksums is a demonstration of the concept. The authors suggest that as one moves up the [[application stack]], there might come a point where there is a net computational gain to the parasite - perhaps one could break down interesting problems into queries of complex [[cryptographic protocol]]s using [[public key cryptography|public keys]]. If there was a net gain, one could in theory use a number of control nodes for which many hosts on the Internet form a [[distributed computing]] network completely unawares.

Students of the University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland, extended this concept into a programmable [[virtual machine]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szene.ch/parasit/index.html Diploma thesis on Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Standard model of particle physics}}
'''Particle physics''' (also known as '''high energy physics''') is a branch of [[physics]] that studies the nature of the particles that constitute [[matter]] and [[radiation]]. Although the word ''[[particle]]'' can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. [[protons]], gas particles, or even household dust), {{em|particle physics}} usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the [[fundamental interaction]]s necessary to explain their behaviour. By our current understanding, these [[elementary particle]]s are excitations of the [[Field (physics)#Quantum fields|quantum fields]] that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the [[Standard Model]]. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest "known" particle, the [[Higgs boson]], or even to the oldest known force field, [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson|title=The Higgs boson - CERN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/advanced-physicsprize2013.pdf | title=The BEH-Mechanism, Interactions with Short Range Forces and Scalar Particles | date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subatomic particles==
[[Image:Standard Model of Elementary Particles Anti.svg|right|350px|thumb|The particle content of the [[Standard Model]] of [[Physics]]]]
Modern&amp;nbsp;particle&amp;nbsp;physics&amp;nbsp;research is focused on [[subatomic particle]]s, including atomic constituents such as [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s (protons and neutrons are composite particles called [[baryon]]s, made of [[quark]]s), produced by [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] and [[scattering]] processes, such as [[photon]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and [[muon]]s, as well as a wide range of [[exotic particle]]s.
Dynamics of particles is also governed by [[quantum mechanics]]; they exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and [[wave]]-like behaviour in others. In more technical terms, they are described by [[quantum state]] vectors in a [[Hilbert space]], which is also treated in [[quantum field theory]]. Following the convention of particle physicists, the term ''[[elementary particle]]s'' is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.&lt;ref name="braibant"/&gt;

All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by a quantum field theory called the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="ifj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Particle Physics and Astrophysics Research|url=http://www.ifj.edu.pl/pro/fiz_astro.php?lang=en|publisher=The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles.&lt;ref name="braibant"&gt;

Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s.

The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the [[experiment]]al tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See [[Theory of Everything]]). In recent years, measurements of [[neutrino]] [[rest mass|mass]] have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}

==History==
{{Modern physics}}
{{main|History of subatomic physics}}
The idea that all [[matter]] is composed of [[elementary particle]]s dates from at least the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novelresearchinstitute.org/library/PhysNuclphys196p.pdf |title=Fundamentals of Physics and Nuclear Physics |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002214053/http://novelresearchinstitute.org/library/PhysNuclphys196p.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[John Dalton]], through his work on [[stoichiometry]], concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciexplorer.blogspot.com/2012/05/quasiparticles.html |title=Scientific Explorer: Quasiparticles |publisher=Sciexplorer.blogspot.com |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[atom]]'', after the Greek word ''[[wikt:ἄτομος|atomos]]'' meaning "indivisible", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a [[chemical element]], but physicists soon discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the [[electron]]. The early 20th century explorations of [[nuclear physics]] and [[quantum physics]] led to proofs of [[nuclear fission]] in 1939 by [[Lise Meitner]] (based on experiments by [[Otto Hahn]]), and [[nuclear fusion]] by [[Hans Bethe]] in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles were found in collisions of particles from increasingly high-energy beams. It was referred to informally as the "[[particle zoo]]". That term was deprecated{{fact|date=December 2016}} after the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, in which the large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles.

==Standard Model==
{{Main|Standard Model}}
The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the [[Standard Model]]. It describes the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental interaction]]s, using mediating [[gauge boson]]s. The species of gauge bosons are eight [[gluon]]s, [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} bosons]], and the [[photon]].&lt;ref name=ifj /&gt; The Standard Model also contains 24&amp;nbsp;[[fundamental particle|fundamental]] [[fermion]]s (12&amp;nbsp;particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all [[matter]].&lt;ref name=pdg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=K|title=Review of Particle Physics|journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics|date=1 July 2010|volume=37|issue=7A|page=075021|doi=10.1088/0954-3899/37/7A/075021|bibcode = 2010JPhG...37g5021N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of [[boson]] known as the [[Higgs boson]]. Early in the morning on 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann |first=Adam |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/07/higgs-boson-discovery/ |title=Newly Discovered Particle Appears to Be Long-Awaited Higgs Boson - Wired Science |publisher=Wired.com |date=28 March 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] ([[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[United States]]). Its 2-mile-long linear particle accelerator began operating in 1962 and was the basis for numerous [[electron]] and [[positron]] collision experiments until 2008. Since then the linear accelerator is being used for the [[Linac Coherent Light Source]] [[X-ray laser]] as well as advanced accelerator design research. SLAC staff continue to participate in developing and building many [[particle detector]]s around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Home Page|url=http://www6.slac.stanford.edu/ |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many other [[particle accelerator]]s also exist.
&lt;!-- These are all accelerator-based... Should we mention a couple cosmic ray experiments as well? --&gt;

The techniques required for modern experimental particle physics are quite varied and complex, constituting a sub-specialty nearly completely distinct{{fact|date=December 2016}} from the theoretical side of the field.

==Theory==
{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Standard model}}
'''Theoretical particle physics''' attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments. See also [[theoretical physics]]. There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today.
One important branch attempts to better understand the [[Standard Model]] and its tests. By extracting the parameters of the Standard Model, from experiments with less uncertainty, this work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands our understanding of nature's building blocks. Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating quantities in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Some theorists working in this area refer to themselves as '''[[Particle physics phenomenology|phenomenologists]]''' and they may use the tools of [[quantum field theory]] and [[effective field theory]]. Others make use of [[lattice field theory]] and call themselves ''lattice theorists''.

Another major effort is in model building where [[model building (particle physics)|model builders]] develop ideas for what physics may lie [[beyond the Standard Model]] (at higher energies or smaller distances). This work is often motivated by the [[hierarchy problem]] and is constrained by existing experimental data. It may involve work on [[supersymmetry]], alternatives to the [[Higgs mechanism]], extra spatial dimensions (such as the [[Randall-Sundrum]] models), [[Preon]] theory, combinations of these, or other ideas.

A third major effort in theoretical particle physics is [[string theory]]. ''String theorists'' attempt to construct a unified description of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] by building a theory based on small strings, and [[branes]] rather than particles. If the theory is successful, it may be considered a "[[Theory of Everything]]", or "TOE".

There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from [[Particle physics in cosmology|particle cosmology]] to [[loop quantum gravity]].

This division of efforts in particle physics is reflected in the names of categories on the [[arXiv]], a [[preprint]] archive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arxiv.org|title=arXiv.org e-Print archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hep-th (theory), hep-ph (phenomenology), hep-ex (experiments), hep-lat ([[lattice gauge theory]]).

==Practical applications==
In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles. In practice, even if "particle physics" is taken to mean only "high-energy atom smashers", many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society. Particle accelerators are used to produce [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]] for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in [[PET imaging]]), or used directly in [[external beam radiotherapy]]. The development of [[superconductor]]s has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics. The [[World Wide Web]] and [[touchscreen]] technology were initially developed at [[CERN]]. Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/benefits/ |title=Fermilab &amp;#124; Science at Fermilab &amp;#124; Benefits to Society |publisher=Fnal.gov |date= |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The primary goal, which is pursued in several distinct ways, is to find and understand what physics may lie [[beyond the standard model]]. There are several powerful experimental reasons to expect new physics, including [[dark matter]] and [[neutrino mass]]. There are also theoretical hints that this new physics should be found at accessible energy scales.

Much of the effort to find this new physics are focused on new collider experiments. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) was completed in 2008 to help continue the search for the [[Higgs boson]], [[supersymmetric particle]]s, and other new physics. An intermediate goal is the construction of the [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC), which will complement the LHC by allowing more precise measurements of the properties of newly found particles. In August 2004, a decision for the technology of the ILC was taken but the site has still to be agreed upon.

In addition, there are important non-collider experiments that also attempt to find and understand [[physics beyond the Standard Model]]. One important non-collider effort is the determination of the [[neutrino]] masses, since these masses may arise from neutrinos mixing with very heavy particles. In addition, [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] observations provide many useful constraints on the dark matter, although it may be impossible to determine the exact nature of the dark matter without the colliders. Finally, lower bounds on the very long [[proton decay|lifetime of the proton]] put constraints on [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] at energy scales much higher than collider experiments will be able to probe any time soon.

In May 2014, the [[Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel]] released its report on particle physics funding priorities for the United States over the next decade. This report emphasized continued U.S. participation in the LHC and ILC, and expansion of the [[Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment]], among other recommendations.

==High energy physics compared to low energy physics==
The term ''high energy physics'' requires elaboration. Intuitively, it might seem incorrect to associate "high energy" with the physics of very small, ''low'' [[mass]] objects, like subatomic particles. By comparison, an example of a [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] system, one [[gram]] of [[hydrogen]], has ~ {{val|6|e=23}} times&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?na "CODATA Value: Avogadro constant"]. The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty. US National Institute of Standards and Technology. June 2015. Retrieved 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; the mass of a single proton. Even an entire [[particle beam|beam]] of protons circulated in the LHC contains ~ {{val|3.23|e=14|u=}} protons,&lt;ref name="lhcbeam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beam Requirements and Fundamental Choices |url=http://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/445762/3/Vol3_Chap2_v4.pdf|publisher=CERN Engineering &amp; Equipment Data Management Service (EDMS)|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with {{val|6.5|e=12|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} of energy, for a total beam energy of ~ {{val|2.1|e=27|u=eV}} or ~ 336.4 [[megajoule|MJ]], which is still ~ {{val|2.7|e=5}} times lower than the mass-energy of a single gram of hydrogen. Yet, the macroscopic realm is "low energy physics",{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} while that of quantum particles is "high energy physics".

The interactions studied in other fields of physics and science have comparatively very low energy. For example, the [[photon energy]] of [[visible light]] is about 1.8 to 3.1 eV. Similarly, the [[bond-dissociation energy]] of a [[carbon–carbon bond]] is about 3.6 eV. Other [[chemical reaction]]s typically involve similar amounts of energy. Even photons with far higher energy, [[gamma ray]]s of the kind produced in [[radioactive decay]], mostly have photon energy between {{val||e=5|u=eV}} and {{val||e=7|u=eV}} – still two [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] lower than the mass of a single proton. Radioactive decay gamma rays are considered as part of [[nuclear physics]], rather than high energy physics.

The proton has a mass of around {{val|9.4|e=8|u=eV}}; some other massive quantum particles, both elementary and [[hadron]]ic, have yet higher masses. Due to these very high energies ''at the single particle level'', particle physics is, in fact, high-energy physics.

'''Plant defense against herbivory''' or '''host-plant resistance''' ('''HPR''') describes a range of [[adaptation]]s [[Evolution |evolved]] by [[plants]] which improve their [[fitness (biology) |survival and reproduction]] by reducing the impact of [[herbivore]]s. [[Plant perception (physiology) |Plants can sense being touched]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Jade (2012). "A bit touchy: Plants' insect defenses activated by touch". Rice University. http://news.rice.edu/2012/04/09/a-bit-touchy-plants-insect-defenses-activated-by-touch-2/&lt;/ref&gt; and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce [[secondary metabolites]], known as [[Heterotelergones|allelochemicals]], that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.

Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants are not easily found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal growth patterns. Another approach diverts herbivores toward eating non-essential parts, or enhances the ability of a plant to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of [[predator |natural enemies]] of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. Each type of defense can be either ''constitutive'' (always present in the plant), or [[Inducible plant defenses against herbivory |''induced'']] (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores).

Historically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at [[vertebrate]] herbivores, such as [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on [[agriculture]], including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in [[biological pest control]] programs; as well as in the search for [[medicinal plants |plants of medical importance]].

==Evolution of defensive traits==
[[File:InsectPlantEvol.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Timeline of plant evolution and the beginnings of different modes of insect herbivory]]
{{main|Evolutionary history of plants}}

The earliest land plants evolved from aquatic plants around {{Ma |450}} (Ma) in the [[Ordovician]] period. Many plants have adapted to iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=727–9 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |year=2000 |last1=Venturi |first1=S. |last2=Donati |first2=F.M. |last3=Venturi |first3=A. |last4=Venturi |first4=M. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmid=11014322}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important antiparasitic action is caused by the block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS). Many plant pesticides are glycosides (as the cardiac [[digitoxin]]) and [[cyanogenic glycosides]] which liberate [[cyanide]], which, blocking [[cytochrome c oxidase]] and [[Sodium-iodide symporter |NIS]], is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in [[seed dormancy]] phase. Iodide is not pesticide, but is oxidized, by vegetable peroxidase, to iodine, which is a strong oxidant, it is able to kill bacteria, fungi and protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Venturi, Sebastiano |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology- |volume=5 |pages=155–162 |year=2011 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cretaceous]] period saw the appearance of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s) at that time is associated with the sudden burst of [[speciation]] in insects.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ehrlich |first1=Paul R. |author2=Peter H. Raven |date=December 1964 |title=Butterflies and plants: a study of coevolution. |journal=Evolution | volume=18 | issue=4 |pages=586–608 |doi=10.2307/2406212 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution |jstor=2406212}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were [[mandibulate]] and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, [[Leaf miner |leaf mining]], [[gall]] forming and nectar-feeding.&lt;ref name=Labandeira&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Labandeira |first1=C.C. |author2=D.L. Dilcher, D.R. Davis, D.L. Wagner |title=Ninety-seven million years of angiosperm-insect association: paleobiological insights into the meaning of coevolution |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/25/12278.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=91 |issue=25 |pages=12278–82 |year=1994 |pmid=11607501 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.12278 |pmc=45420 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112278L |last3=Davis |first3=D. R. |last4=Wagner |first4=D. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative abundance of different species of plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined in part by the level of defensive compounds in the different species.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas where water and nutrients are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.

===Records of herbivores===
[[File:ViburnumFossil.jpg|thumb|''Viburnum lesquereuxii'' leaf with insect damage; Dakota Sandstone (Cretaceous) of Ellsworth County, Kansas. Scale bar is 10 mm.]]

Our understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; the observation of plant debris in fossilised [[coprolite |animal faeces]]; and the construction of herbivore mouthparts.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1998&gt;{{cite journal | author=Labandeira, C.C. | year=1998 | title=Early History Of Arthropod And Vascular Plant Associations 1 | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=329–377 | doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.26.1.329 |bibcode=1998AREPS..26..329L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long thought to be a [[Mesozoic]] phenomenon, evidence for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it. As previously discussed, the first land plants emerged around 450 million years ago; however, herbivory, and therefore the need for plant defenses, has undoubtedly been around for longer. Herbivory first evolved due to marine organisms within ancient lakes and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ecological Relationships of Plants and Animals |last=Howe |first=Henry F. |last2=Westley |first2=Lynn C. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-19-504431-2 |location=New York |pages=29 |quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian, around {{Ma |{{period start |devonian |-1}}}}, there is evidence that they were being consumed.&lt;ref name=Labandeira2007&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Labandeira, C. | year=2007

During the ensuing 75 million years, plants evolved a range of more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it being fed upon.&lt;ref name=Labandeira2007/&gt; Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1998/&gt;

===Co-evolution===

Herbivores are dependent on plants for food, and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defenses. [[Herbivore adaptations to plant defense]] have been likened to ''offensive traits'' and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant.&lt;ref name=Karban&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Karban |first1=Richard |author2=Anurag A. Agrawal |date=November 2002 |title=Herbivore offense |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=641–664 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change, called [[co-evolution]]. When an herbivore eats a plant it [[evolutionary pressure |selects]] for plants that can mount a defensive response. In cases where this relationship demonstrates ''specificity'' (the evolution of each trait is due to the other), and ''reciprocity'' (both traits must evolve), the species are thought to have co-evolved.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Futuyma |first1=Douglas J. |author2=Montgomery Slatkin |title=Coevolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |year=1983 |isbn=0-87893-228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "escape and radiation" mechanism for co-evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind [[speciation]],&lt;ref name=Ehrlich/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thompson |first=J. |editor=H.

==Types==
Plant defenses can be classified generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Traw |first1=Brian M. |author2=Todd E.

===Qualitative and quantitative metabolites===

Secondary metabolites are often characterized as either ''[[qualitative property|qualitative]]'' or ''[[quantitative property|quantitative]]''. Qualitative metabolites are defined as [[toxins]] that interfere with a herbivore's metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted [[generalist and specialist species |generalist]] herbivores.

Quantitative chemicals are those that are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant [[cell wall]]s indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.&lt;ref name="theis"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Theis |first1=Nina |author2=Manuel Lerdau |year=2003 |title=The evolution of function in plant secondary metabolites |journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences |volume=164 |issue=3 Suppl. |pages=S93–S102 |url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf |doi=10.1086/374190 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418020403/http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/mlerdau/Papers/Theis2003.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pelargonium |geranium]], for example, produces a unique chemical compound in its petals to defend itself from [[Japanese beetles]]. Within 30 minutes of ingestion the chemical paralyzes the herbivore. While the chemical usually wears off within a few hours, during this time the beetle is often consumed by its own predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar10/garden0310.htm |title=Geraniums and Begonias |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antiherbivory compounds ====
{{further|Medicinal plants}}

Plants have evolved many secondary metabolites involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds and can be classified into three sub-groups: [[nitrogen]] compounds (including ''alkaloids'', ''cyanogenic glycosides'', ''glucosinolates'' and ''benzoxazinoids''), terpenoids, and phenolics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/aprodbc.htm |title=Biochemical defenses: secondary metabolites |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alkaloid]]s are derived from various [[amino acid]]s. Over 3000 known alkaloids exist, examples include [[nicotine]], [[caffeine]], [[morphine]], [[cocaine]], [[colchicine]], [[ergoline]]s, [[strychnine]], and [[quinine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/alkaloids.htm |title=Alkaloids: contain a N-containing heterocycle |accessdate=2007-06-26 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkaloids have [[pharmacological]] effects on humans and other animals.

[[Cyanogenic glycoside]]s are stored in inactive forms in plant [[vacuole]]s. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to come into contact with [[enzyme]]s in the [[cytoplasm]] releasing [[hydrogen cyanide]] which blocks cellular respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicon Volume 38, Issue 1, January 2000, Pages 11-36 János Vetter Plant cyanogenic glycosides {{doi |10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glucosinolates]] are activated in much the same way as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause [[gastroenteritis]], salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth.&lt;ref name=Rhoades1979/&gt; [[Benzoxazinoids]], secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses ([[Poaceae]]), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Niemeyer |first=HM |title=Hydroxamic acids derived from 2-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one: key defense chemicals of cereals |journal=J Agric Food Chem |year=2009 |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1677–1696 |doi=10.1021/jf8034034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones.

The [[terpenoids]], sometimes referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to [[terpene]]s, derived from five-carbon [[isoprene]] units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/aterpenes.htm |title=Terpenoids |accessdate=2007-06-26 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons.&lt;ref name=Terp&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Gershenzon |first1=Jonathan |author2=Wolfgang Kreis |editor=Michael Wink |title=Biochemistry of plant secondary metabolism |publisher=Sheffield Academic Press |location=London |year=1999 |pages=222–279 |isbn=0-8493-4085-3 |chapter=Biochemistry of terpenoids}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are [[volatility (chemistry) |volatile]] [[essential oil]]s such as [[citronella oil |citronella]], [[limonene]], [[menthol]], [[camphor]], and [[pinene]]. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in [[latex]] and [[resins]], and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making ''[[Rhododendron]]'' leaves poisonous. Plant [[steroid]]s and [[sterol]]s are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including [[vitamin D]], [[glycosides]] (such as [[digitalis]]) and [[saponin]]s (which lyse [[red blood cell]]s of herbivores).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Albert T. |last=Sneden |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/terpenes.htm |title=Terpenes |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Natural Products as Medicinally Useful Agents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716022711/http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/terpenes.htm |archivedate=2007-07-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenolics, sometimes called ''phenols'', consist of an [[aromatic]] 6-carbon ring bonded to a [[Hydroxyl |hydroxy]] group. Some phenols have [[antiseptic]] properties, while others disrupt [[endocrine]] activity. Phenolics range from simple [[tannin]]s to the more complex [[flavonoid]]s that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called [[polyphenol]]s are capable of producing many different types of effects on humans, including [[polyphenol antioxidant |antioxidant]] properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: [[lignin]], [[silymarin]] and [[cannabinoid]]s.&lt;ref name=Phenols&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/botf99/herbnew/aphenols.htm |title=Phenols |accessdate=2007-05-21 |work=Plant Defense Systems &amp; Medicinal Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proanthocyanidin |Condensed tannin]]s, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and [[digestive enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Van Soest |title=Nutritional ecology of the ruminant: ruminant metabolism, nutritional strategies, the cellulolytic fermentation, and the chemistry of forages and plant fibers |publisher=O &amp; B Books |location=Corvallis, Oregon |year=1982 |isbn=0-9601586-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some plants use [[fatty acid]] derivates, [[amino acid]]s and even [[peptide]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=John W.

===Mechanical defenses===
[[File:Raspberry cane - closeup in winter - P.2005.03.jpg |thumb |left |The prickles on the stem of this [[raspberry]] plant, serve as a mechanical defense against herbivory.]]

Many plants have external structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore's physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant's surface; for example, [[resins]], [[lignin]]s, [[silica]], and wax cover the [[Epidermis (botany) |epidermis]] of [[terrestrial plant]]s and alter the texture of the plant tissue. The leaves of [[holly]] plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce [[gummosis]] or sap that traps insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Fernandes, G. W. |year=1994 |title=Plant mechanical defenses against insect herbivory |journal=Revista Brasileira de Entomologia |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=421–433 [http://www.icb.ufmg.br/big/leeb/publicacoes/1994.Fernandes.pdf]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spines and thorns====
A plant's leaves and stem may be covered with sharp prickles, spines, thorns, or [[trichomes]]- hairs on the leaf often with barbs, sometimes containing [[irritant (biology) |irritant]]s or poisons. Plant structural features like spines and thorns reduce feeding by large ungulate herbivores (e.g. [[kudu]], [[impala]], and [[Capra (genus) |goats]]) by restricting the herbivores' feeding rate, or by wearing down the molars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Susan M. |author2=Owen-Smith, Norman |date=September 1986 |title=Effects of plant spinescence on large mammalian herbivores |journal=Oecologia |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=446–455 |doi=10.1007/BF01036753|bibcode=1986Oecol..68..446C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphides]] are sharp needles of [[calcium oxalate]] or [[calcium carbonate]] in plant tissues, making ingestion painful, damaging a herbivore's mouth and gullet and causing more efficient delivery of the plant's toxins. The structure of a plant, its branching and leaf arrangement may also be evolved to reduce herbivore impact. The shrubs of New Zealand have evolved special wide branching adaptations believed to be a response to browsing birds such as the [[moa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Bond, W. |author2=Lee, W. |author3=Craine, J. |year=2004 |title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas |journal=Oikos |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=500–508 |doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, African [[Acacia]]s have long spines low in the canopy, but very short spines high in the canopy, which is comparatively safe from herbivores such as giraffes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Young |first=Truman P. |year=1987 |title=Increased thorn length in ''Acacia drepanolobium''- an induced response to browsing |journal=Oecologia |volume=71 |pages=436–438 |doi=10.1007/BF00378718 |issue=3 |bibcode=1987Oecol..71..436Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Truman P. |author2=Bell Okello |year=1998 |title=Relaxation of an induced defense after exclusion of herbivores: spines on ''Acacia drepanolobium'' |journal=Oecologia |volume=115 |pages=508–513. |doi=10.1007/s004420050548 |issue=4|bibcode=1998Oecol.115..508Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cocos nucifera - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-187.jpg |thumb|upright|[[Coconut palm]]s protect their fruit by surrounding it with multiple layers of armor.]]
Trees such as palms protect their fruit by multiple layers of armor, needing efficient tools to break through to the seed contents.

====Thigmonastic movements====
[[Thigmonasty|Thigmonastic movements]], those that occur in response to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the [[sensitive plant]], ''Mimosa pudica'', close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The [[proximate cause]] of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the [[turgor]] pressure in the [[pulvini]] at the base of leaves resulting from [[osmosis|osmotic]] phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed. This response lowers the surface area available to herbivores, which are presented with the underside of each leaflet, and results in a wilted appearance. It may also physically dislodge small herbivores, such as insects.&lt;ref name="Raven 2005"/&gt;

===Mimicry and camouflage===
{{further|Mimicry in plants}}

Some plants [[Mimicry in plants|mimic]] the presence of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies are less likely to lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of [[neotropical]] [[vine]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Passiflora]]'' (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of ''[[Heliconius]]'' [[butterflies]] on their leaves, which discourage [[oviposition]] by butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Kathy S. |author2=Lawrence E.

===Indirect defenses===
[[Image:Acacia-collinsii.jpg |thumb |left |upright |The large and directly defensive thorn-like stipules of ''[[Vachellia collinsii]]'' are also hollow and offer shelter for ants, which indirectly protect the plant against herbivores.]]

Another category of plant defenses are those features that indirectly protect the plant by enhancing the probability of attracting the [[natural enemy |natural enemies]] of herbivores. Such an arrangement is known as [[Mutualism (biology) |mutualism]], in this case of the "[[the enemy of my enemy is my friend |enemy of my enemy]]" variety. One such feature are [[semiochemical]]s, given off by plants. Semiochemicals are a group of [[volatile organic compounds]] involved in interactions between organisms. One group of semiochemicals are [[Heterotelergones |allelochemicals]]; consisting of [[allomone]]s, which play a defensive role in [[interspecies communication]], and [[kairomone]]s, which are used by members of higher [[trophic level]]s to locate food sources. When a plant is attacked it releases allelochemics containing an abnormal ratio of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs).&lt;ref name=Dicke&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dicke |first1=Marcel |author2=Joop J.A. van Loon |date=December 2000 |title=Multitrophic effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in an evolutionary context |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume97=|issue=3 |pages=237–249 |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.2000.00736.x |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Allmann | first1=S. | last2=Baldwin | first2=I.

Plants sometimes provide housing and food items for natural enemies of herbivores, known as "biotic" defense mechanisms, as a means to maintain their presence. For example, trees from the genus ''[[Macaranga]]'' have adapted their thin stem walls to create ideal housing for an ant species (genus ''[[Crematogaster]]''), which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores.&lt;ref name=Heil&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Heil |first1=Martin |author2=Brigitte Fiala, K.

Similarly, several ''[[Acacia]]'' tree species have developed stipular spines (direct defenses) that are swollen at the base, forming a hollow structure that provides housing for protective ants. These ''Acacia'' trees also produce [[nectar]] in [[extrafloral nectaries]] on their leaves as food for the ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Truman P. |author2=Cynthia H.

[[Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense]] is common. Most plants have [[endophyte]]s, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and [[pathogen]]ic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing [[fungi]] which are common in grasses such as [[tall fescue]] (''Festuca arundinacea'').&lt;ref name="Raven 2005"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Raven |first1=Peter H. |author2=Ray F.

==Costs and benefits==
Defensive structures and chemicals are costly as they require resources that could otherwise be used by plants to maximize growth and reproduction. Many models have been proposed to explore how and why some plants make this investment in defenses against herbivores.

===Optimal defense hypothesis===
The optimal defense hypothesis attempts to explain how the kinds of defenses a particular plant might use reflect the threats each individual plant faces.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stamp |first=Nancy |title=Out of the quagmire of plant defense hypotheses |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=23–55 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12661508 |doi=10.1086/367580}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model considers three main factors, namely: risk of attack, value of the plant part, and the cost of defense.&lt;ref name=Rhoades&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rhoades |first1=D.

The first factor determining optimal defense is risk: how likely is it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the ''plant apparency hypothesis'', which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores.&lt;ref name=Feeny&gt;{{Cite book |last=Feeny |first=P. |editor=James W. Wallace |editor2=Richard L.

The second factor is the value of protection: would the plant be less able to survive and reproduce after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect.&lt;ref name=McKey1&gt;{{Cite book |first=McKey |last=D. |editor=Gerald A.

For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as [[amygdalin]]. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Swain |first1=Elisabeth |author2=Chun Ping Li |author3=Jonathan E.

The final consideration is cost: how much will a particular defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pennings |first1=Steven C. |author2=Erin L.

===Carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis===
The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, also known as the ''environmental constraint hypothesis'' or ''Carbon Nutrient Balance Model'' (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of [[nutrient]]s in the environment.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=John P. |author2=Stuart Chapin, III |author3=David R. Klein |date=May 1983 |title=Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory |journal=Oikos |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=357–368 |doi=10.2307/3544308 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |jstor=3544308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Tuomi |first1=J. |editor=William J.

Niemela |author3=F. S. Chapin, III |author4=J. P. Bryant |author5=S. Siren.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in [[nitrogen]]-poor [[soil]]s will use [[carbon]]-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of [[fertilizer]]s, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.

===Growth rate hypothesis===
The growth rate hypothesis, also known as the ''resource availability hypothesis'', states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the [[limiting factor]] in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases.&lt;ref name=Coley&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Colley |first1=Phyllis D. |author2=John P.

A recent test of this model involved a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between [[clay]] [[soil]]s (nutrient rich) and white [[sand]] (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but in the presence of herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fine |first1=Paul V. A. |author2=Italo Mesones |author3=Phyllis D.

===Growth-differentiation balance hypothesis===
The growth-differentiation balance hypothesis states that plant defenses are a result of a tradeoff between "growth-related processes" and "differentiation-related processes" in different environments.&lt;ref name=Loomis&gt;{{Cite book |last=Loomis |first=W.

In situations where resources (e.g. water and nutrients) limit photosynthesis, carbon supply is predicted to limit both growth and defense. As resource availability increases, the requirements needed to support photosynthesis are met, allowing for accumulation of carbohydrate in tissues. As resources are not sufficient to meet the large demands of growth, these carbon compounds can instead be partitioned into the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites (phenolics, tannins, etc.). In environments where the resource demands for growth are met, carbon is allocated to rapidly dividing meristems (high sink strength) at the expense of secondary metabolism. Thus rapidly growing plants are predicted to contain lower levels of secondary metabolites and vice versa. In addition, the tradeoff predicted by the GDBH may change over time, as evidenced by a recent study on [[Salix]] spp. Much support for this hypothesis is present in the literature, and some scientists consider the GDBH the most mature of the plant defense hypotheses.

==Importance to humans ==

===Agriculture ===
The variation of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known even in the early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major [[socio-economic]] problems. The [[hemiptera]]n pest insect [[phylloxera]] was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of French [[vineyard]]s. [[Charles Valentine Riley]] noted that the American species ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the [[French wine]] industry by suggesting the [[grafting]] of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto ''Vitis labrusca'' root stocks.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;{{Cite web |first=Sridhar |last=Polavarapu |url=http://aesop.rutgers.edu/~hamilton/lecture12.htm |title=Plant Resistance to insects |accessdate=2007-05-16 |year=2001 |work=Agricultural Entomology &amp; Pest Management |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713203855/http://aesop.rutgers.edu/~hamilton/lecture12.htm |archivedate=2007-07-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been known since the late 17th century that plants contain [[wiktionary:noxious |noxious]] chemicals which are avoided by insects.

The selective breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, it is often the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance [[gene]]s. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by [[Recombinant DNA |recombinant]] techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous [[transgenic]] approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill [[lepidoptera]]n [[caterpillar]]s. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due to the possibility of [[ecological]] and [[toxicological]] side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Emden |first=H.F. |date=November 1999 |title=Transgenic Host Plant Resistance to Insects—Some Reservations |journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=788–797 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/aesa/1999/00000092/00000006/art00002 | accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history mandrakes (''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'') have been highly sought after for their reputed [[aphrodisiac]] properties. However, the roots of the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid [[Hyoscine hydrobromide |scopolamine]], which, at high doses, acts as a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]], and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during [[childbirth |labor]]; in smaller doses it is used to prevent [[motion sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~asneden/tropane%20alkaloids.pdf |title=The Tropane Alkaloids |accessdate=2007-05-23 |author=Albert T.

'''Political opportunity theory''', sometimes also known as the '''political process theory''' or '''political opportunity structure''', is an approach of [[social movements]] heavily influenced by [[political sociology]]. It argues that success or failure of social movements is primarily affected by political opportunities. Social theorists Peter Eisinger, [[Sidney Tarrow]], David Meyer and [[Doug McAdam]] are considered among the most prominent supporters of this theory.

==Theory==
Three vital components for movement formation are:
# '''Insurgent Consciousness:''' Certain members of society feel deprived, mistreated, and have grievances directed at a system that they perceive as unjust (see also [[deprivation theory]]).&lt;ref name=etal&gt;Ryan Cragun, Deborah Cragun, et al, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Blacksleet River, {{ISBN|1-4499-7747-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJFHTucmPTMC&amp; Google Print, p.233-234]&lt;/ref&gt; When a collective sense of injustice develops, it motivates people to become movement members.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; Movement activists do not choose their goals at random, it is the political context which stresses certain grievances around which movements organize.&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt;
# '''Organizational Strength:''' Similar to the main argument of the [[resource mobilization theory]], the argument here is that the social movement must have strong and efficient leadership and sufficient resources.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; The political opportunity theory has much in common with the related [[resource mobilization]] theory, particularly when it is seen as focusing on mobilization of resources ''external'' to the movement.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Associated and indigenous organizations also play a major role in recruiting and motivating actors to join and participate within social movements. Often, the rise of a movement merges with other preexisting and highly organized blocs of individuals who lend the movement resources and support. The more heavily that individuals are integrated into disconnected but otherwise mobile communities, the higher the likelihood of those communities merging and lending support to causes that their members are active in.
# '''Political Opportunities:''' If the existing political system is vulnerable to a challenge, it creates an opportunity for others – like the movement members – to issue such a challenge and try to use this opportune time to push through a social change.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; This vulnerability can be the result of:
## Increasing [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]
## Decline in [[political repression|repression]]
## Division within [[elite]]s (particularly when it grows to a point where some support organized opposition)
## Increased political enfranchisement&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Political opportunity theory argues that the actions of the activists are dependent on the existence – or lack – of a specific political opportunity.&lt;ref name=dsm&gt;[[David S. Meyer]], ''Protest and Political Opportunities'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 30: 125-145 (Volume publication date August 2004), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110545}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.soc.30.012703.110545]&lt;/ref&gt; There are various definitions of political opportunity, but Meyer (2004) stresses that of Tarrow (1998):
{{quote|"consistent – but not necessarily formal or permanent – dimensions of the political struggle that encourage people to engage in contentious politics".&lt;ref name=t&gt;Tarrow S. 1998. Power in Movement. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press. 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From these three components emerges what proponent Doug McAdam terms cognitive liberation, the ability for those active in political protest to recognize their collective strength and take advantage of political opportunities as they become available to them. As political opposition to the movement's demands weakens, members may feel a collective sense of symbolic efficacy, the capacity to enact significant change within the political arena. This opens up significant opportunities for movements to both recruit members and mobilize under a concentrated and effective cycle of demands.

Over time these broad socioeconomic processes develop, maintain and cause decline within the movement. A movement, once developed, may be affected by the level of social control placed on it, which in turn affects its ability to mobilize and maintain members. For when the movement's demands are portrayed as underdeveloped or unattractive they risk losing or failing to receive support from outside institutions.

Furthermore, movements may be affected by oligarchization, when a class of individuals within the movement work to ensure the maintenance of the movement itself rather than a continual push for collective goals, or cooptation, when outside support is garnered for the movement at the same time as it is forced to sacrifice its goals to meet the demands of these supporting institutions. This in turn may lead to the loss of indigenous support, and along with it many of the supporting grassroots organizations that were able to quickly mobilize members at the onset of the movement.

Meyer (2004) credits Eisinger (1973) with first use of the political opportunity theory framed in such a way (traces of which, of course, go further back).&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; Eisinger asked why in the 1960s the level of riots about race and poverty varied between different places in the United States and notes that lack of visible openings for participation of repressed or discouraged dissident made riots more likely. Thus the inability to legally air grievances was the political opportunity which led to organization and mobilization of movements expressing their grievances by rioting.&lt;ref&gt;Eisinger P . 1973 . The conditions of protest behavior in American cities . Am. Polit. Sci. Rev. 81 : 11 – 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer (2004) in his overview of political opportunity theory noted that this broader context can affect:
* "mobilizing",
* "advancing particular claims rather than others",
* "cultivating some alliances rather than others",
* "employing particular political strategies and tactics rather than others", and
* "affecting mainstream institutional politics and policy".&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt;

A key advantage of the theory is that it explains why social movements emerge and/or increase their activity at a given time.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; When there are no political opportunities, simply having grievances (organizational consciousness) and resources will not be enough.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; Only when all three of these components are present, the movement has a chance to succeed.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Along with social movement research, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2014. "Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research". ''Sociology''. 48(4): 829-837.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that political opportunity structures should be used when analyzing the importance and meaning of social problems.

==Vs. political structure==
Within the [[structure and agency]] debate, actions of activists (agents) can only be understood when seen in the broader context of political opportunities (structure).&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; The term structure has been used to characterize political opportunities in older scholarship.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; A political opportunity structure has been defined as the circumstances surrounding a political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Jereon Gunning, Hamas, democracy, religion and violence&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tarrow – who has used this term in his earlier publications himself – now argues it is misleading, as most opportunities need to be perceived, and are situational, not structural.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Political opportunity structures are prone to change and can alter in days (or last for decades). Demographics and socioeconomic factors create "structure" which affects political actors.

==Political mediation model==
One side model based on the political opportunity theory is known as the political mediation model. The political mediation model focuses on how the political context affects the strategic choices of the political actors.&lt;ref name=etal/&gt; This model goes beyond looking at whether the movements just succeeded or failed, and analyzes other consequences, including unintentional, as well as [[collective benefits]].&lt;ref name=etal/&gt;

Opposite of political opportunity is a political constraint.

==Criticism==
The political process model has been criticized both structurally and conceptually. Critics suggest that political process theorists utilize overly broad definitions as to what constitute political opportunities, and those definitions vary widely based on the historical context of the social movement itself. Furthermore, as political process theory frames movements as legally or politically detached from the state, it ignores movements that form out of cultural solidarity or do not directly stand in opposition to extant rules or regulations. Critics contend that theorists place too great an emphasis on the role of social networks while often almost entirely ignoring the cultural underpinnings that allow these networks to form and subsist.
In response to some criticisms, [[Doug McAdam]], [[Sidney Tarrow]] and [[Charles Tilly]] proposed the Dynamics of Contention research program, which focuses on identifying mechanisms to explain political opportunities, rather than relying on an abstract structure.&lt;ref&gt;McAdam D, Tarrow S, Tilly C. 2001. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[MoveOn.org]] is an organization that started in 1998&lt;ref name="What is MoveOn.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://front.moveon.org/about/|title=What is MoveOn.org?|website=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still operates to this day. MoveOn.org is a progressive&lt;ref name="What is MoveOn.org"/&gt; organization that specifically centers around political issues. MoveOn.org allows viewers to start their own petitions, a form of [[collective behavior]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/socfwk/ch/ch21a.html|title=Chapter 21 Section A Types of Collective Behavior|website=www.peoi.org|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could potentially start a social movement of its own. MoveOn.org also includes other petitions and political articles and video clips on the front page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://front.moveon.org/|title=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|website=MoveOn.Org {{!}} Democracy In Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; for people to sign and view as a mechanism for people to assemble over a similar issue, perpetuating the concept of [[solidarity]], or a sense of collective identity over political discourse. MoveOn.org can also be applied to [[Resource mobilization|resource mobilization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthcommcapacity.org/resource-mobilization-important/|title=What is Resource Mobilization and Why is it so Important? - Health Communication Capacity Collaborative - Social and Behavior Change Communication|date=2014-10-20|website=Health Communication Capacity Collaborative - Social and Behavior Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that MoveOn.org is a site that is meant to assemble people, which adds to the strength and success of the organization.

'''Post-Impressionism''' (also spelled '''Postimpressionism''') is a predominantly French [[art movement]] that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of [[Fauvism]]. Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cloisonnism]], [[Pont-Aven School]], and [[Synthetism]], along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by [[Paul Cézanne]] (known as father of Post-impressionism), [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Timeline, Post-Impressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Post-Impressionism'' was first used by art critic [[Roger Fry]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="brettell"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=v5TcYXGDeI8C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22the+term+Post-impressionism%22,+%221906%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIqYXYo8DMAhVLuhQKHROHBYAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20term%20Post-impressionism%22%2C%20%221906%22&amp;f=false Richard R. Brettell, ''Modern Art, 1851-1929: Capitalism and Representation'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al"&gt;Peter Morrin, Judith Zilczer, William C. Agee, ''The Advent of Modernism. Post-Impressionism and North American Art, 1900-1918'', High Museum of Art, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Frank Rutter]] in a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]] published in ''Art News'', 15 October 1910, described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen&gt;Bullen, J. B. ''Post-impressionists in England'', p.37. Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-415-00216-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-00216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organized the 1910 exhibition, ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', defining it as the development of French art since [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. 

Post-Impressionists extended [[Impressionism]] while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

==Overview==
The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with what they felt was the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. [[Georges Seurat]] and his followers concerned themselves with [[Pointillism]], the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. [[Paul Cézanne]] set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to "make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums".&lt;ref&gt;Huyghe, Rene: ''Impressionism''. (1973). Secaucus, N.J.: Chartwell Books Inc., p. 222. {{OCLC|153804642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the saturated colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]] experimented with [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] ideas between the mid-1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated [[Pointillism]], which he called scientific Impressionism, before returning to a purer [[Impressionism]] in the last decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cogniat, Raymond (1975). Pissarro. New York: Crown, pp. 69–72. {{ISBN|0-517-52477-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind.

Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Yet, the abstract concerns of harmony and structural arrangement, in the work of all these artists, took precedence over [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. Artists such as Seurat adopted a meticulously scientific approach to colour and composition.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173&amp;section_id=T068997#skipToContent Caroline Boyle-Turner, ''Post-Impressionism, History and application of the term'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger painters during the early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as [[Fauvism]] and [[Cubism]], breaking from Post-Impressionism.

==Defining Post-Impressionism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|left|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]]]]
[[Image:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], ''Portrait of [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'', 1886, [[Tate Gallery]] [[London]]]]
The term was used in 1906,&lt;ref name="brettell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrin et al" /&gt; and again in 1910 by [[Roger Fry]] in the title of an exhibition of modern French painters: ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'', organized by Fry for the [[Grafton Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/manetpostimpress00graf  ''Manet and the post-impressionists''; Nov. 8 to Jan. 15, 1910-11, Grafton Galleries, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before Fry's show, art critic [[Frank Rutter]] had put the term ''Post-Impressionist'' in print in ''Art News'' of 15 October 1910, during a review of the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he described [[Othon Friesz]] as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show ''The Post-Impressionists of France''.&lt;ref name=bullen /&gt;

Most of the artists in Fry's exhibition were younger than the Impressionists. Fry later explained: "For purposes of convenience, it was necessary to give these artists a name, and I chose, as being the vaguest and most non-committal, the name of Post-Impressionism. This merely stated their position in time relatively to the Impressionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, Lawrence (2005). ''Facts on File Encyclopedia of Art'': 5. New York: Facts on File, p. 804. {{ISBN|0-8160-5802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rewald]] limited the scope to the years between 1886 and 1892 in his pioneering publication on ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956). Rewald considered this a continuation of his 1946 study, ''History of Impressionism'', and pointed out that a "subsequent volume dedicated to the second half of the post-impressionist period":&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"&gt;Rewald, John: ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'', revised edition: Secker &amp; Warburg, London, 1978, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Post-Impressionism: From Gauguin to Matisse'', was to follow. This volume would extend the period covered to other artistic movements derived from Impressionism, though confined to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rewald focused on such outstanding early Post-Impressionists active in France as [[van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Seurat]], and [[Odilon Redon|Redon]]. He explored their relationships as well as the artistic circles they frequented (or were in opposition to), including:
* [[Neo-Impressionism]]: ridiculed by contemporary art critics as well as artists as [[Pointillism]]; [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac|Signac]] would have preferred other terms: [[Divisionism]] for example
* [[Cloisonnism]]: a short-lived term introduced in 1888 by the art critic [[Édouard Dujardin]], was to promote the work of [[Louis Anquetin]], and was later also applied to contemporary works of his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]
* [[Synthetism]]: another short-lived term coined in 1889 to distinguish recent works of Gauguin and Bernard from that of more traditional Impressionists exhibiting with them at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889|Café Volpini]].
* [[Pont-Aven School]]: implying little more than that the artists involved had been working for a while in Pont-Aven or elsewhere in Brittany.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]: a term highly welcomed by vanguard critics in 1891, when Gauguin dropped Synthetism as soon as he was acclaimed to be the leader of Symbolism in painting.
Furthermore, in his introduction to Post-Impressionism, Rewald opted for a second volume featuring [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Henri Rousseau]] "le Douanier", [[Les Nabis]] and [[Cézanne]] as well as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], the young [[Picasso]] and Gauguin's last trip to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]; it was to expand the period covered at least into the first decade of the 20th century—yet this second volume remained unfinished.

===Reviews and adjustments===
Rewald wrote that "the term 'Post-Impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one." Convenient, when the term is by definition limited to French visual arts derived from Impressionism since 1886.  Rewald's approach to historical data was narrative rather than analytic, and beyond this point he believed it would be sufficient to "let the sources speak for themselves."&lt;ref name="Rewald 1978, p. 9"/&gt;

Rival terms like [[Modernism]] or [[Symbolism in art|Symbolism]] were never as easy to handle, for they covered literature, architecture and other arts as well, and they expanded to other countries.

* [[Modernism]], thus, is now considered to be the central movement within ''international'' western civilization with its original roots in France, going back beyond the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], however, is considered to be a concept which emerged a century later in France, and implied an individual approach. Local national traditions as well as individual settings therefore could stand side by side, and from the very beginning a broad variety of artists practicing some kind of symbolic imagery, ranged between extreme positions: [[The Nabis]] for example united to find synthesis of tradition and brand new form, while others kept to traditional, more or less academic forms, when they were looking for fresh contents: Symbolism is therefore often linked to fantastic, esoteric, erotic and other non-realist subject matter.

To meet the recent discussion, the connotations of the term 'Post-Impressionism' were challenged again: [[Alan Bowness]] and his collaborators expanded the period covered forward to 1914 and the beginning of [[World War I]], but limited their approach widely on the 1890s to France. Other European countries are pushed back to standard connotations, and Eastern Europe is completely excluded.

So, while a split may be seen between classical 'Impressionism' and 'Post-Impressionism' in 1886, the end and the extent of 'Post-Impressionism' remains under discussion. For Bowness and his contributors as well as for Rewald, '[[Cubism]]' was an absolutely fresh start, and so Cubism has been seen in France since the beginning, and later in Anglosaxonia. Meanwhile, Eastern European artists, however, did not care so much for western traditions, and proceeded to manners of painting called [[Abstract painting|abstract]] and [[Suprematism|suprematic]]—terms expanding far into the 20th century.

According to the present state of discussion, ''Post-Impressionism'' is a term best used within Rewald's definition in a strictly historical manner, concentrating on French art between 1886 and 1914, and re-considering the altered positions of ''[[Impressionists|impressionist]]'' painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Auguste Renoir]], and others—as well as all new schools and movements at the turn of the century: from [[Cloisonnism]] to [[Cubism]]. The declarations of war, in July/August 1914, indicate probably far more than the beginning of a [[World War I|World War]]—they signal a major break in European cultural history, too.

Along with general art history information given about "Post-Impressionism" works, there are many museums that offer additional history, information and gallery works, both online and in house, that can help viewers understand a deeper meaning of "Post-Impressionism" in terms of fine art and traditional art applications.

'''Prairie restoration''' is a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] effort to restore [[prairie]] lands that were destroyed due to industrial, agricultural, commercial, or residential development. For example, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]] alone once held over {{convert|35,000|sqmi|km2}} of prairie land and now just {{convert|3|sqmi|km2}} of that original prairie land is left.

==Purpose==
[[ecology|Ecologically]], prairie restoration aids in [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] of earth's [[topsoil]], which is often exposed to [[erosion]] from wind and rain when prairies are plowed under to make way for new commerce. Conversely, much more of the prairie lands have become the [[fertility (soil)|fertile]] fields on which [[cereal crops]] of [[Maize|corn]], [[barley]] and [[wheat]] are grown.

Many prairie plants are also highly resistant to [[drought]], temperature extremes, disease, and native insect pests. They are frequently used for [[xeriscaping]] projects in [[arid]] regions of the American West.

[[File:Coastal prairie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Coast]]al prairie restoration project in [[Texas]].]]A restoration project of prairie lands can be large or small. A [[backyard]] prairie restoration will enrich [[soil]], help with erosion and take up extra water in excessive [[rain]]falls. Prairie [[flower]]s are attractive to native [[butterflies]] and other [[pollinators]]. On a larger scale, [[local community|communities]] and [[corporation]]s are creating areas of restored prairies which in turn will store [[organic matter|organic]] [[carbon]] in the soil and help maintain the [[biodiversity]] of the 3000 plus [[species]] that count on the grasslands for [[food]] and [[wikt:shelter|shelter]].

==Types of plants==
Some prominent [[tallgrass prairie]] grasses include [[big bluestem]], [[indiangrass]], and [[switchgrass]]. [[Midgrass prairie|Midgrass]] and [[Shortgrass prairie|shortgrass]] species include [[little bluestem]], [[Bouteloua curtipendula|side oats grama]], and [[Bouteloua dactyloides|buffalograss]]. Many of the diverse prairie forbs (herbaceous, non-[[graminoid]] flowering plants) are structurally specialized to resist herbaceous [[Grazing|grazers]] such as [[American bison]]. Some have hairy leaves that may help deter the [[cold]] and prevent excessive [[evaporation]]. Many of forbs contain secondary compounds that were discovered by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples]] and are still used widely today. For example, [[purple coneflower]] (''Echinacea purpurea'' or just ''[[Echinacea]]'') is used as an [[herbal remedy]] for [[common cold|cold]]s.

Early prairie restoration efforts tended to focus largely on a few dominant species, typically grasses, with little attention to seed source. With experience, later restorers have realized the importance of obtaining a broad mix of species and using [[local ecotype]] seed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iowaprairienetwork.org/FAQ/ecotype_importance.shtml ''The Importance of using Local Ecotype Plant Material''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923202337/http://iowaprairienetwork.org/FAQ/ecotype_importance.shtml |date=2010-09-23 }}, [http://www.iowaprairienetwork.org/ Iowa Prairie Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care of prairies==
[[Fire]] is a big component to the success of grasslands, large or small. [[Controlled burn]]s, with a permit, are recommended every 4–8 years (after two growth seasons) to burn away dead plants; prevent certain other plants from encroaching (such as trees) and release [[nutrients]] into the ground to encourage new growth. A much more wildlife habitat friendly alternative to burning every 4–8 years is to burn 1/4 to 1/8 of a tract every year. This will leave wildlife a home every year and still accomplish the task of burning. The Native Americans may also have used the burns to control [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s such as [[ticks]]. If controlled burns are not possible, rotational mowing is recommended as a substitute. 

One of the newer methods available is [[holistic management]], which uses livestock as a substitute for the [[keystone species]] such as [[bison]]. This allows the rotational mowing to be done by animals which in turn mimics nature more closely. Holistic management also can use fire as a tool, but in a more limited way and in combination with the mowing done by animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlin|first=Chrissy|title=Allan Savory: How livestock can protect the land|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/03/10/allan-savory-how-livestock-can-protect-land|publisher=GreenBiz|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prairie contributors==
Some popular prairie restoration projects have been completed and maintained by conservation departments, such as [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]], located in [[Wilmington, Will County, Illinois|Wilmington, Illinois]]. This restoration project is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[united States Forest Service|Forest Service]] and the [[Illinois Department of Natural Resources]]. It sits on part of the [[Joliet Army Ammunition Plant]], specifically on an area once [[contamination|contaminated]] from [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] [[manufacturing]]. Since 1997, the project has opened some {{convert|15,000|acre|km2}} of restored prairie to the public.

Another large restoration project finds its home on the ample area of [[Fermilab]]; a [[United States government|U.S. governmental]] [[atomic accelerator]] [[laboratory]] located in [[Batavia, Illinois]]. Fermilab's {{convert|6,800|acre|km2}} sit a top fertile [[arable land|farmland]] and the prairie restoration project consists of approximately {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of that. This project began in 1971 and continues today with the help of Fermilab [[employee]]s and many community [[teacher]]s, [[botanists]] and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.

'''Quedlinburg''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkveːdlɪnbʊʁk}}) is a town situated just north of the [[Harz]] mountains, in the [[Harz (district)|district of Harz]] in the west of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. In 1994, the castle, church and old town were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]].

Quedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the [[Quedlinburg (district)|district of Quedlinburg]] until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the [[Romanesque Road]].

==History==
[[File:Quedlinburg Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Castle]]

The town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as ''Gross Orden'' on the eastern bank of the River [[Bode River|Bode]]. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King [[Henry the Fowler]] (''Heinrich der Vogler''). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of [[Corvey]].

According to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the "cradle of the German Reich".&lt;ref name="Booklet"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

After Henry's death in 936, his widow [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Saint Matilda]] founded a religious community for women (''[[Frauenstift]]'') on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.

The Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 936, was an imperial ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' of the Saxon emperors. The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.

In 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.

In 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.

The town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].

In 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.&lt;!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --&gt; Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807–13, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without "taking the veil"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].

During the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the "most German of all German" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.

During the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.

Quedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.

During Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkhäuser|''Fachwerk'']] houses.

==Geography==

===Location===
The town is located north of the [[Harz]] mountains, about 123 m above NHN. The nearest mountains reach 181 m above NHN. The largest part of the town is located in the western part of the [[Bode (river)|Bode]] river valley. This river comes from the [[Harz]] mountains and flows into the river [[Saale]], a tributary of the river [[Elbe]]. The municipal area of Quedlinburg is {{convert|120.42|km²|abbr=off}}. Before the incorporation of the two (previously independent) municipalities of [[Gernrode]] and [[Bad Suderode]] in January 2014 it was only {{convert|78.14|km²|abbr=off}}.

===Climate===
Quedlinburg has a [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb) resulting from prevailing [[westerlies]], blowing from the high-pressure area in the central Atlantic towards Scandinavia. Snowfall occurs almost every  winter. January and February are the coldest months of the year, with an average temperature of 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C and 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C. July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 17&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F) and 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F). The average annual precipitation is close to 438&amp;nbsp;mm with rain occurring usually from May to September. This precipitation is one of the lowest in Germany, which has an annual average close to 700&amp;nbsp;mm. In August 2010, Quedlinburg was the driest  place in Germany, with only 72,4 l/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/KU/allgemeines/spitzenreiter/2010/bms__201008,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/bms_201008.pdf Press release of the Deutsche Wetterdienst]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quedlinburg Hohe Straße 8.jpg|thumb|[[Half-timbered]] house]]
[[File:Quedlinburg Markt.JPG|thumb|Quedlinburg (in the old town)]]

In the centre of the town are a wide selection of [[half-timbered]] buildings from at least five different centuries (including a 14th-century structure, one of Germany's oldest), while around the outer fringes of the old town are examples of [[Art Nouveau|''Jugendstil'']] buildings, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Since December 1994, the old town of Quedlinburg and the castle mount with the ''[[Quedlinburg Abbey|Stiftskirche]]'' (collegiate church) are listed as one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/535 Unesco World heritage list]&lt;/ref&gt; Quedlinburg is one of the best-preserved medieval and Renaissance towns in Europe, having escaped major damage in World War II.

In 2006, the Selke valley branch of the [[Harz Narrow Gauge Railways]] was extended to Quedlinburg from [[Gernrode]], giving access to the historic steam [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge railway]], Alexisbad and the [[high Harz]] plateau.

The castle and ''Stifstkirche St. Servatius'' still dominate the town like in the early Middle Ages. The church is a prime example of German [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. The treasure of the church, containing ancient Christian religious artifacts and books, was stolen by an American soldier but brought back to Quedlinburg in 1993 and is again on display here.

The former ''Stiftskirche St. Wiperti'' was established in 936 when the ''Kanonikerstift St. Wigpertus'' (of male canons) was moved from the castle hill to make way for what became Quedlinburg Abbey. The church was built at the location of the first Ottonian Royal palace at Quedlinburg. Around 1020, a three-aisled crypt was added to the basilica. The crypt, which survived all later alterations to the church, is also a designated stop on the Romanesque Road today.&lt;ref name="Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|last=Antz (ed.)|first=Christian|title=Strasse der Romanik (German)|publisher=Verlag Janos Stekovics|year=2001|isbn=3-929330-89-X|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}}

{{TOC right}}

==Definition==
A regional park can be a special park district covering a region crossing several jurisdiction boundaries, or a park system of a single jurisdiction, such as a province, county, or city.

==By country==

===Canada===

====Saskatchewan====
There are 101 regional parks in Saskatchewan. All parks are operated by volunteer boards.

===Italy===
{{See also|List of regional parks of Italy}}
Regional parks in Italy are administered by each [[Regions of Italy|region in Italy]], a government unit like a U.S. state.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Regional parks of New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], regional parks are administered by [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] rather than the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] or [[territorial authority|territorial authorities]].

===United States===

====Definitions====
In the United States, a regional park is sometimes referred to as a 'Metropolitan Park (Metropark)' or as an [[open space reserve]]. The terms ''region'' and ''metropolitan'' can have different meanings in U.S. local government agencies. Regional parks can be administered by a regional park board, a [[U.S. state|state]], [[county#United States|county]] or other units of [[local government]]. A special authority can be set up, under the joint jurisdiction of two or more government bodies or as an independent park district to administer parks. Individual parks may or may not cross governmental boundaries. The park district holds the authority, similar to fire protection districts, to manage and raise taxes to cover park acquisition and management costs.

====Midwest====
{{See also|List of county and regional parks in Minnesota}}
In Ohio, under [[Ohio Revised Code]] Chapter 1545, metro parks such as the [[Metro Parks (Columbus, Ohio)|Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks]] can have their own [[police officer|sworn police forces]] ([[park ranger|rangers]]); The [[Cleveland Metroparks]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] [[Five Rivers Metroparks]] are also in the state. Other examples of large regional park systems are the [[Huron-Clinton Metroparks]] in southeast [[Michigan]]; and the [[Three Rivers Park District]] in [[Minnesota]].

====California====
{{See also|Category:Regional parks in California}}
The [[East Bay Regional Park District]] and [[Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District]] have extensive parklands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], protecting habitat and offering recreation.

===United Kingdom===
====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by [[subdivisions of Scotland|local authorities]].  Currently Scotland has three regional parks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/regional-parks|title=Regional parks|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Reyner Banham''', [[FRIBA]] (2 March 1922 – 19 March 1988) was an [[English people|English]] architectural [[critic]] and writer best known for his theoretical [[treatise]] ''Theory and Design in the First Machine Age'' (1960) and for his 1971 book ''Los Angeles:  The Architecture of Four Ecologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reyner Banham, Architectural Critic, Dies at 66 |last=Goldberger |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Goldberger |date=22 March 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/obituaries/reyner-banham-architectural-critic-dies-at-66.html?scp=2&amp;sq=reyner%20banham&amp;st=cse |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he categorized the [[Los Angeles]] experience into four ecological models (Surfurbia, Foothills, The Plains of Id, and Autopia) and explored the distinct architectural cultures of each. Banham worked in [[London]], but lived primarily in the [[United States]] from the late 1960s until the end of his life.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Banham Los Angeles Architecture 4 Ecologies.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of a paperback edition of ''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies'' (1971), a popular study of [[Los Angeles]]]]

He was born in [[Norwich]], England to Percy Banham, a gas engineer, and Violet Frances Maud Reyner. He was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]] and gained an engineering scholarship with the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], where he spent much of the [[Second World War]]. In Norwich he gave art lectures, wrote reviews for the local paper and was involved with the [[Maddermarket Theatre]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sutherland Lyall|title=Banham, (Peter) Reyner (1922–1988)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004; online edn, May 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39982|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Banham entered the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London where he studied under [[Anthony Blunt]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/banhamr|title=Banham, [Peter] Reyner, "Peter"|author=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner, who was his doctoral supervisor, invited Banham to study the history of modern architecture, following his own work ''Pioneers of the Modern Movement'' (1936).

==Career==
In 1952 Banham began working for the ''[[Architectural Review]]''.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Banham also had connections with the [[Independent Group]], the 1956 ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' art exhibition – considered by many to the birth of [[pop art]] – and the thinking of the [[Smithson]]s and of [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], on the '[[New Brutalism]]', which he documented in his 1966 book ''The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?''{{clarify|date=January 2014}} But before this in ''Theory and Design in the First Machine Age'', he cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking [[modernism]] to build structures in which the '[[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]' was actually subject to formal strictures. Later, he wrote a ''Guide to Modern Architecture'' (1962, later titled ''Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture''). Banham predicted a "second age" of the machine and [[mass consumption]]. ''The Architecture of Well-Tempered Environment'' (1969) follows Giedion's ''Mechanization Takes Command'' (1948), putting the development of technologies such as electricity and [[air conditioning]] ahead of the classic account of structures. In the 1960s, [[Cedric Price]], [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], and the [[Archigram]] group also found this to be an absorbing arena of thought.

[[Environmentalism|Green thinking]] (''Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies'') and then the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock]] of 1973 affected him. The '[[postmodernism|postmodern]]' was for him uneasy, and he evolved into the conscience of postwar British architecture. He broke with [[utopian]] and technical [[Formalism (art)|formalism]]. ''Scenes in America Deserta'' (1982) talks of open spaces and his anticipation of a 'modern' future. In ''A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900–1925'' (1986) Banham demonstrates the influence of American [[grain elevators]] and "Daylight" factories on the [[Bauhaus]] and other modernist projects in Europe.

===Teaching===
As a professor, Banham taught at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]], [[University College London]] and the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo]], and through the 1980s at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. He had been appointed the Sheldon H. Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts|Institute of Fine Arts, New York University]] shortly before his death, but he never taught there. 

==Awards and tributes==
He was featured in the short documentary ''Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles''; in his book on Los Angeles, Banham said that he learned to drive so he could read the city in the original.

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140716141308.htm|title=Sexual harassment, assault common on scientific field studies, survey indicates|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/fed-up-with-sexual-harassment-ii-safe.html|title=Women In Astronomy: Fed Up with Sexual Harassment II: The SAFE study w/ Dr. Kate Clancy|last=Richey|first=Christina|date=2014-09-11|website=Women In Astronomy|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2015-03-11|title=Social behaviour: Indecent advances|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7542-251a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=251–253|doi=10.1038/nj7542-251a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201512/astronomy.cfm|title=Astronomy Allies Team Up to Confront Sexual Harassment|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-end-sexual-harassment-in-astronomy1/|title=How to End Sexual Harassment in Astronomy|last=Urry|first=Meg|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has had a major impact on American [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/30/us/astronomy-sexual-harassment/index.html|title=Sexual harassment in STEM: 'It's tragic'|last=CNN|first=Sara Ganim,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the [[United States Congress|USA Congress]] to counter sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2018-02-08|title=US science agency will require universities to report sexual harassment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01744-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7692|pages=287–288|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01744-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/transcript-of-my-oral-testimony-from-february-27th-congressional-hearing-on-sexual-misconduct-in-the-sciences/|title=Transcript of my oral testimony from February 27th Congressional hearing on sexual misconduct in the sciences {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-now-studies-of-sexual-harassment-show-the-way/|title=What Happens Now? Studies of Sexual Harassment Can Show the Way|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://breakingbio.com/2014/10/07/breaking-bio-episode-68-safe13-with-drs-clancy-nelson-rutherford-hinde/|title="Breaking Bio Episode 68 – #SAFE13 with Drs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">'''TIME-ITEM''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of ''Topics'' that describes the content of undergraduate [[medical education]].  TIME is an acronym for "Topics for Indexing Medical Education"; ITEM is an acronym for "Index de thèmes pour l’éducation médicale."  Version 1.0 of the taxonomy has been released and the [[web application]] that allows users to work with it is still under development.  Its developers are seeking more collaborators to expand and validate the taxonomy and to guide future development of the web application.

== History ==

The development of TIME-ITEM began at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 2006.  It was initially developed to act as a content [[Index (publishing)|index]] for a [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum map]] being constructed there.  After its initial presentation at the 2006 conference of the [http://www.came-acem.ca/ Canadian Association for Medical Education],&lt;ref&gt;Willett T &amp; Clarke M. A Map of Medical Concepts: A General-use Database for Applications in Medical Education.  AFMC Resource Group on Medical Informatics Reception.  At the Canadian Association for Medical Education Conference (May 2006) London, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; early collaborators included the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McMaster University]] and [[Queen's University]].

== Features ==

The TIME-ITEM ontology is unique in that it is designed specifically for undergraduate medical education.  As such, it includes fewer strictly biomedical entries than other common medical [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabularies]] (such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] or [[SNOMED CT]]) but more entries relating to the medico-social concepts of communication, collaboration, professionalism, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willett | first1 = TG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = KC. | last3 = Broudo | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = M. | title = It's about TIME: a general-purpose taxonomy of subjects in medical education | journal = Med Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–8 |date=Apr 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03012.x | pmid = 18298447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics within TIME-ITEM are arranged poly-[[Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchically]], meaning any Topic can have more than one [[Tree (data structure)|parent]].  Relationships are established based on the logic that learning about a Topic contributes to the learning of all its parent Topics. 

In addition to housing the ontology of Topics, the TIME-ITEM web application can house multiple [[Curriculum framework|Outcome frameworks]].  All [[Outcome-based education|Outcomes]], whether private Outcomes entered by single institutions or publicly available medical education Outcomes (such as [[CanMeds 2005]]) are hierarchically linked to one or more Topics in the ontology.  In this way, the contribution of each Topic to multiple Outcomes is made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Willett TG, Marshall KC, Broudo M &amp; Clarke M.  TIME as a generic index for outcome-based medical education.  ''Medical Teacher'' 2008; 29(7):655-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the [[XML]] documents exported from TIME-ITEM (which contain the hierarchy of Outcomes and TIME-ITEM Topics) is being developed alongside the [http://www.medbiq.org MedBiquitous] Competency standards.  

The taxonomy currently exists in English only but translation to Canadian French is in progress.

== Applications ==

TIME-ITEM is intended to be a general-use ontology for medical [[Education Informatics|education informatics]].  It has two primary potential applications:
# Inclusion in [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum maps]].  By mapping learning objects or sessions to TIME-ITEM Topics in a curriculum map, the map becomes searchable for both granular and broad concepts.  If one or more Outcome frameworks are included with the Topic ontology, then the contribution of each curricular element to one or more Outcomes is made explicit.  This also facilitates curriculum [[evaluation]] in terms of one or more outcome frameworks.
# Indexing learning, assessment and portfolio objects.  Metatagging [[learning object]]s or [[assessment objects]] with a controlled vocabulary enhances the organization and retrieval of objects from a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]].  Metatagging [[electronic portfolio]] entries allows one to show how multiple entries "add up" to a demonstration of competence with respect to certain educational outcomes.

The possibility of expanding or modifying TIME-ITEM for use in postgraduate/continuing medical education and in nursing education is currently being explored.

'''UGENE''' is computer [[software]] for [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name="OkonechGolFursov2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FursovNovikova2008"/&gt; It works on [[desktop computer]] operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], or [[Linux]]. It is released as [[free and open-source software]], under a [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) version 2.

UGENE helps biologists to analyze various [[Biology|biological]] [[genetics]] data, such as [[DNA sequencer|sequences]], annotations, [[multiple alignment]]s, [[phylogenetic tree]]s, [[Sequencing|NGS assemblies]], and others. The data can be stored both locally (on a personal computer) and on a shared storage (e.g., a lab database).

UGENE integrates dozens of well-known biological tools, algorithms, and original tools in the context of [[genomics]], [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary biology]], [[virology]], and other branches of life science. UGENE provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) for the pre-built tools so biologists with no [[computer programming]] skills can access those tools more easily.

Using UGENE Workflow Designer, it is possible to streamline a multi-step analysis. The workflow consists of blocks such as data readers, blocks executing embedded tools and algorithms, and data writers. Blocks can be created with command line tools or a script. A set of sample workflows is available in the Workflow Designer, to annotate sequences, convert data formats, analyze NGS data, etc.

Beside the graphical interface, UGENE also has a [[command-line interface]]. Workflows may also be executed thereby.

To improve performance, UGENE uses [[multi-core processor]]s (CPUs) and [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) to optimize a few algorithms.&lt;ref name="FursovOshchepkov2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EfremovFursov2009" /&gt;

* [[Protein structure|3D structure]] view
* Circular view
* [[Chromatography|Chromatogram]] view
* Graphs View: GC-content, AG-content, and other
* [[Dot plot (bioinformatics)|Dot plot]] view

==Alignment Editor==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UGENE-1.9.0-alignment editor.png|thumb|right|250px|Alignment Editor|250px]] --&gt;
The Alignment Editor allows working with multiple [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleic acid]] or [[Amino acid|protein]] sequences - [[Multiple alignment|aligning]] them, editing the alignment, analyzing it, storing the [[consensus sequence]], building a phylogenetic tree, and so on.

==Phylogenetic Tree Viewer==
The Phylogenetic Tree Viewer helps to visualize and edit phylogenetic trees. It is possible to synchronize a tree with the corresponding multiple alignment used to build the tree.

==Assembly Browser==
[[Image:Ugene-1.9.3-ab.png|thumb|right|250px|Assembly Browser|250px]]
The ''Assembly Browser'' project was started in 2010 as an entry for Illumina iDEA Challenge 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126033841/http://www.illumina.com/idea Illumina iDEA Challenge 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The browser allows users to visualize and browse large (up to hundreds of millions of short reads) next generation sequence assemblies. It supports SAM,&lt;ref&gt;[http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf SAM]&lt;/ref&gt; BAM (the binary version of SAM), and ACE formats. Before browsing assembly data in UGENE, an input file is converted to a UGENE database file automatically. This approach has its pros and cons. The pros are that this allows viewing the whole assembly, navigating in it, and going to well-covered regions rapidly. The cons are that a conversion may take time for a large file, and needs enough disk space to store the database.

==Workflow Designer==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UGENE-1.9.0-wd.png|thumb|right|250px|Workflow Designer|250px]] --&gt;
''UGENE Workflow Designer'' allows creating and running complex computational [[workflow]] schemas.&lt;ref name="FursovVarlamov2009"/&gt;

The distinguishing feature of Workflow Designer, relative to other [[Scientific workflow system|bioinformatics workflow management systems]] is that workflows are executed on a local computer. It helps to avoid data transfer issues, whereas other tools’ reliance on remote file storage and internet connectivity does not.

The elements that a workflow consists of correspond to the bulk of algorithms integrated into UGENE. Using Workflow Designer also allows creating custom workflow elements. The elements can be based on a command-line tool or a script.

Workflows are stored in a special text format. This allows their reuse, and transfer between users.

A workflow can be run using the graphical interface or launched from the command line. The graphical interface also allows controlling the workflow execution, storing the parameters, and so on.

There is an embedded library of workflow samples to convert, filter, and annotate data, with several pipelines to analyze NGS data developed in collaboration with NIH NIAID.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx NIH NIAID]&lt;/ref&gt; A wizard is available for each workflow sample.

==Supported biological data formats==
* [[Sequence (biology)|Sequence]]s and [[Annotation#Computational biology|annotation]]s: [[FASTA format|FASTA]] (.fa), [[GenBank]] (.gb), [[EMBL]] (.emb), [[General feature format|GFF]] (.gff)
* [[Multiple sequence alignment]]s: [[Clustal]] (.aln), MSF (.msf), [[Stockholm format|Stockholm]] (.sto), [[Nexus file|Nexus]] (.nex)
* [[Protein structure|3D structures]]: [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] (.pdb), [[Molecular Modeling Database|MMDB]] (.prt)&lt;ref name="MMDB" /&gt;
* [[Chromatogram]]s: ABIF (.abi), SCF (.scf)
* Short reads: Sequence Alignment/Map(SAM) (.sam), binary version of SAM (.bam), [[ACE file format|ACE]] (.ace), FASTQ (.fastq)
* [[Phylogenetic tree]]s: [[Newick format|Newick]] (.nwk), PHYLIP (.phy)
* Other formats: Bairoch ([[enzyme]]s info), HMM ([[HMMER]] profiles), PWM and PFM ([[Position-specific scoring matrix|position matrices]]), SNP and VCF4 (genome variations)

==Release cycle==
UGENE is primarily developed by Unipro LLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://unipro.ru/ Unipro LLC]&lt;/ref&gt; with headquarters in Akademgorodok of Novosibirsk, Russia. Each [[Iteration#Project management|iteration]] lasts about 1–2 months, followed by a new [[Software release life cycle|release]]. Development snapshots may also be downloaded.

The features to include in each release are mostly initiated by users.

{{Other|Mass distribution}}
'''Weight distribution''' is the apportioning of [[weight]] within a [[vehicle]], especially [[cars]], [[airplanes]], and [[trains]]. Typically, it is written in the form ''x''/''y'', where ''x'' is the percentage of weight in the front, and ''y'' is the percentage in the back.

In a vehicle which relies on gravity in some way, weight distribution directly affects a variety of vehicle characteristics, including [[car handling|handling]], [[acceleration]], [[traction (engineering)|traction]], and component life.  For this reason weight distribution varies with the vehicle's intended usage. For example, a [[Drag racing|drag car]] maximizes traction at the rear axle while countering the reactionary pitch-up torque.  It generates this counter-torque by placing a small amount of counterweight at a great distance forward of the rear axle.

In the [[airline industry]], load balancing is used to evenly distribute the weight of passengers, cargo, and fuel throughout an aircraft, so as to keep the aircraft's [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|center of gravity]] close to its [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)#Aircraft|center of pressure]] to avoid losing pitch control.  In military transport aircraft, it is common to have a [[loadmaster]] as a part of the crew; their responsibilities include calculating accurate load information for center of gravity calculations, and ensuring cargo is properly secured to prevent its shifting.

In large aircraft and ships, multiple fuel tanks and pumps are often used, so that as fuel is consumed, the remaining fuel can be positioned to keep the vehicle balanced, and to reduce stability problems associated with the [[free surface effect]].

In the [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking industry]], individual axle weight limits require balancing the cargo when the gross vehicle weight nears the legal limit.
