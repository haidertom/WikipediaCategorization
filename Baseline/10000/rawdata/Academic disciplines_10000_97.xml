'''''A History of God''''' is a book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It details the history of the three major [[monotheistic]] traditions, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], along with [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. The evolution of the idea of [[God]] is traced from its ancient roots in the [[Middle East]] up to the present day.

==Summary==

===Judaism===
Armstrong begins with the rise of the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Yahweh]] (Jahweh), one of the deities of [[Canaan]]. According to Armstrong, the cult of Yahweh consisted of a variety of ethnic groups that migrated to [[Canaan]] in three waves. These groups were united by their loyalty to Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahweh was unique in the ancient Middle East in that he actually participated in the [[wikt:profane|profane]] lives of his worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She then examines the sources of the [[Pentateuch]] by way of the four supposed authors, or groups of authors, known as [[Documentary hypothesis|''J'', ''E'', ''P'' and ''D'']]. Moreover, she explores some of the textual tensions that exist in the [[Pentateuch]] as a result of the theological tensions between these authors, or groups of authors. For Armstrong, this tension can be seen in, for example, the contrasting accounts of [[theophany|theophanies]]. The [[Jahwist]] (J) writes of very "intimate" encounters between Abraham and Yahweh, while the [[Elohist]] (E) "prefers to distance the event and make the old legends less [[anthropomorphic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=A History of God|year=1993|publisher=Ballatine Books|isbn=0-345-38456-3|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There follows an examination of the major [[Israelite]] [[prophet]]s, including [[Isaiah]], second Isaiah, [[Hosea]] and [[Ezekiel]], and the contribution each made to the [[Jewish]] conception of [[God]].

===Christianity===
Armstrong then turns to the stories attributed to the life of [[Jesus]]. She identifies his roots in the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] tradition of [[Hillel the Elder]] and his effect on the Jewish conception of a god. The death of Jesus and its attendant symbolism are examined, including the various constructions others, most notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], have placed upon these events. 

The book explores the rise of trinitarianism, leading to the [[Nicene Creed]], and traces the evolution of the Christian conception of God and the [[Trinity]] in the respective [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|Western]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Logic and Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The rise of [[Islam]] and its appreciation of the nature of God are examined.  Armstrong analyzes how modern [[Shia Islam]], with its emphasis upon social action in the service of [[Allah]], the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and the [[Shia Imams]], was a key factor that brought about the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.

Subsequent chapters examine respectively both philosophical approaches to the idea of God, and the mystical relationship with God. 

Armstrong discusses the rise of modern Christian religiosity, in particular the [[Protestantism]] of [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]].

===Conclusion===
The final chapters examine the notion of the ''[[Death of God]]'' and the idea of God in a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] world.

'''American Institute of International Law''' was an international scientific association for the study and progress of international law in the Americas.{{sfn|Lorca|2014|p=328}} The idea to form an organization that would codify international law was established at a meeting of the Third Committee of American Jurists in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on July 16, 1912.{{sfn|Harley|1931|p=276}} The institute was founded on October 12, 1912 by [[James Brown Scott]] and [[Alejandro Alvarez]], and inaugurated December 29, 1915 at the [[Second Pan American Scientific Congress]], held in [[Washington D.C.]] On January 6, 1916, it adopted a Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Nations. The Declaration differed from other projects of a like kind in that it was not based solely upon philosophic principles, but was based exclusively upon decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].{{sfn|Scott|1916|p=Forward}}

== Objectives ==
The goals of the institute were:{{sfn|Scott|1916|p=4}}
#To give precision to the general principles of international law as they now exist, or to formulate new ones, in conformity with the solidarity which unites the members of the society of civilized nations, in order to strengthen these bonds and, especially, the bonds between the American peoples;
# To study questions of international law, particularly questions of an American character, and to endeavor to solve them, either in conformity with generally accepted principles, or by extending and developing them, or by creating new principles adapted to the special needs of the American Continent;
# To discover a method of codifying the general or special principles of international law, and to elaborate projects of codification on matters which lend themselves thereto;
# To aid in bringing about the triumph of the principles of justice and of humanity which should govern the relations between peoples, considered as nations, through more extensive instruction in international law, particularly in American universities, through lectures and addresses, as well as through publications and all other means;
# To organize the study of international law along truly scientific and practical lines in a way that meets the needs of modern life, and taking into account the problems of our hemisphere and American doctrines;
# To contribute, within the limits of its competence and the means at its disposal, toward the maintenance of peace, or toward the observance of the laws of war and the mitigation of the evils thereof;
# To increase the sentiment of fraternity among the Republics of the American Continent, so as to strengthen friendship and mutual confidence among the citizens of the countries of the New World.

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Applied economics''' is the application of [[economic theory]] and [[econometrics]] in specific settings. As one of the two sets of fields of [[economics]] (the other set being the ''core''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeaweb.org/students/Fields.php&lt;/ref&gt; it is typically characterized by the application of the ''core'', i.e. economic theory and [[econometrics]], to address practical issues in a range of fields including  [[demographic economics]], [[labour economics]], [[business economics]], [[industrial organization]], [[agricultural economics]], [[development economics]], [[education economics]], [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], [[health economics]], [[monetary economics]], [[public economics]], and [[economic history]]. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using [[econometrics]], [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the "vernacular".&lt;ref name =Swann&gt;Swann, G. M. P. (2006) ''Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics'' (published by Edward Elgar).&lt;/ref&gt;  This range of approaches is indicative of what [[Roger Backhouse (economist)|Roger Backhouse]] and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=backhouse&gt;Backhouse, R. and Jeff Biddle (2000) ‘[https://read.dukeupress.edu/hope/article-pdf/32/Suppl_1/1/427135/01-Biddlebackhouse.pdf The concept of applied economics: a history of ambiguity and multiple meanings]’, ''History of Applied Economics 32'' (annual supplement), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Among broad [[Economic methodology|methodological]] distinctions, one source places it in neither [[positive economics|positive]] nor [[normative economics]] but the ''art of economics'', [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]ed as "what most economists do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=David Colander |last=Colander |first=David |year=1992 |title=Retrospectives: The Lost Art of Economics |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=191–198 [p. 197–198] |jstor=2138310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The origin and meanings of Applied Economics has a long history going back to the writing of [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]. Say wrote about "applying" the “general principles of political economy” to "ascertain the rule of action of any combination of circumstances presented to us." The full title of Mill’s (1848) work is Principles of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

==J.N. Keynes discussion==
[[John Neville Keynes]] was perhaps the first to use the phrase “applied economics”. He noted that the "English School" ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Elliott Cairnes]], and [[Nassau William Senior]])&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. 1877. Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy. London: Longmans, Green and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senior, Nassau. 1828. An Introductory Lecture on Political Economy. The Pamphleteer 29:33–47. Reprinted in vol. 1 of The Methodology of Economics: Nineteenth-Century British Contributions, edited by Roger Backhouse. London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that political economy was a positive, abstract, deductive science; and that this school made a clear distinction  “between political economy itself and its applications to practice" (1917, 12). This School thought that a general body of theory could be established through abstract reasoning&amp;nbsp;– not relying on a wide knowledge of economic facts. From this point of view applying this theory involved making allowances for some of the factors ignored in building the abstract theories.  Keynes wrote about applying the political economies hypothetical laws to interpreting and explaining of “concrete industrial facts." The issue of conceptual distinction between political economy as a science (involving formulating laws which govern  the production and distribution of wealth) and political economy as an art (using the laws to tackle practical problems).&lt;ref name=keynes&gt;Keynes, John Neville. 1917. The Scope and Method of Political Economy. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst noting the rival view of the historical economists, who believed that the goals being pursued by policy makers and the means to pursue them were an integral part of the science of economics, J.N Keynes believed in the desirability of the "English School's" distinction between the discovery of principles and their application (1917, 54).&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

Indeed, it was he who proposed using the phrase “applied economics” instead of “the art of political economy”.  Keynes further discussed the uses of the phrases applied political economy and applied economics noting three different uses:&lt;ref name=keynes /&gt;

# in the sense suggested in the text [in association with the art of political economy];
# to designate the application of economic theory to the interpretation and explanation of particular economic phenomena, without any necessary reference however, to the solution of practical questions;
# to mark off the more concrete and specialized portions of economic doctrine from those more abstract doctrines that are held to pervade all economic reasoning. (1917, 58–59) and applying theories of economy on what we have in reality to get a healthy enterprise and business prosperity.

==Other 19th and early 20th century economists use of the term==

[[Léon Walras]], for example, planned to organize his main work into volumes on "pure," "applied," and "social" economics. Jaffé (1983) describes Walras's plan as involving making a distinction between that which is true, is useful, and is just.  In using the term true, Walras referred to propositions that necessarily followed from the nature of things. Pure economics then involves pure logic. Applied economics involves examining ways to achieve practical goals and requires the making judgments about whether or not the logic of pure economics was relevant to the real world. Social economics also presumed pure economics, but dealt with a different range of questions than did applied economics.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé,William. 1983.William Jaffé's Essays on Walras. Edited by Donald A.Walker. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vilfredo Pareto]] ([1906] 1971, 104) follows as similar usage suggesting economics might begin by eliminating that which is inessential to  examine problems as reduced to their principal and essentials. He distinguishes between "pure economics" from "applied economics" with pure economics containing only the principal lines of argument and applied economics involving supplying the details.&lt;ref&gt;Pareto, Vilfredo. [1906] 1971. Manual of Political Economy. Translated by Ann S. Schwier. New York: Kelley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1954, 23) referred to some applied fields in economics the repetition of which might help highlight some of the issues involved in what defining applied economics involves. He discussed the following fields:&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A. 1954. A History of Economic Analysis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# those that are typically thought of as part of economics but which also looked at individually to allow greater attention to detail – e.g. money and banking, trade, cycles, and location
# those that are independent of economics but study of them is needed for economics. These include subjects such as [[accounting]], actuarial science, and [[insurance]]
# those that are areas of public policy: agriculture, labour, transportation, utility industries, control of industry, and public finance
# [[comparative economic systems]]
# [[demography]]
# [[area studies]]

==More modern views==

===Mainstream view===
Modern mainstream economics holds the view that there is a body of abstract economic theory –  the "core"  –  and applied economics involves the practitioner in the lowering some elements of the abstraction of this to examine particular issues. This lowering of the level of abstraction may involve:&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;
* relabeling variables as more specific, concrete concepts;
* providing some structure to allow the drawing of more detailed conclusions;
* producing numerical estimates for some of the parameters ;
* using the analysis to interpret the real world phenomenon which are interpreted as examples of some more general class of events that the core theory might be used to examine.

===Economics as a science===
Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) describe [[Richard Stone|Stone]]'s attempt to face the challenge of making economics into a science by combining theory and measurement within a cohesive framework. They report Stone’s proposal for the establishment of the now famous Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Pesaran&gt;Pesaran, M. H.  and G. C. Harcourt (2000),“The life and work of John Richard Nicholas Stone 1913–1991,”Economic Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Stone argued that:
:''"The ultimate aim of applied economics is to increase human welfare by the investigation and analysis of economic problems of the real world. It is the view of the Department that this can best be achieved by the synthesis of three types of study which now tend to be pursued in isolation. The Department will concentrate simultaneously on the work of observations, i.e. the discovery and preparation of data; the theoretical appraisal of problems, i.e. the framing of hypotheses in a form suitable for quantitative testing; and the development of statistical methods appropriate to the special problems of economic information. The special character of the Department’s approach to problems of the real world will lie in this attempt at systematic synthesis."'' (Stone in Pesaran and Harcourt (2000) pp. 149–150)&lt;ref name="Pesaran"/&gt;

===Other views===

The basis for rival approaches tends to be the denial that sound theory can be made without some concrete linking with its area of application. Both the 19th century [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]] and the 20th Century [[Institutional economics|Institutionalists]] argue in this way. [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Mitchell]] (1936) noted that those working in "specialized fields" had little use for kind of qualitative theory postulated by [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]]. Mitchell suggested that knowledge of "real markets," would cause the complexion and content of economic theory (Mitchell 1937, 26–28). [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]] shared this view that theoretical concepts might or rather should arise out of the analysis of real world data. For both Mitchell and Friedman economics should involve an interaction between examining data and formulating hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wesley C. 1937. The Backward Art of Spending Money. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue which is related to the [[McCloskey critique]]. This is economists do not necessarily practice what they preach. In this context that is the claim to be an "applied economist," is just shorthand for saying they are looking at the real economy. What is being applied need not be "economic theory", as conventionally defined rather something more basic. [[Eli Devons]] made a distinction between three different kinds of "things", any of which might be being applied:&lt;ref&gt;Devons, Eli. 1961. Applied Economics: The Application of What? In The Logic of Personal Knowledge: Essays Presented to [[Michael Polanyi]] on His Seventieth  Birthday 11 March 1961 (no editor named). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

* theoretical models;
* commonsense axioms, and
* theoretical concepts.

===Journals===

====''The Journal of Applied Economics''====
The Journal of Applied Economics publishes original contributions on applied issues in micro and macroeconomics. The primary criteria for selecting papers are quality and importance for the field. Papers based on a well motivated research problem that make a concrete contribution to empirical economics or applied theory are especially encouraged.

====''Applied Economics''====
''Applied Economics'' is a journal that interprets its subject area as "the application of economic analysis to specific problems in both the public and private sectors" and seeks to publish "quantitative studies, the results of which are of use in the practical field" and thus may help "bring economic theory nearer to reality"; ''Applied Economics'' is a leading peer-reviewed journal in economics and its practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Economics'', [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html Aims &amp; Scope] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105022013/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/Routledge/00036846.html |date=January 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics''====
This quarterly journal which began publication in 2009 is from the [[American Economic Association]]. It publishes papers on a range of topics in applied economics, particularly empirical microeconomic issues, such as in labor economics, development microeconomics, health,  [[education economics|education]], [[demographic economics|demography]], empirical corporate finance, empirical studies of trade, and empirical [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;As described at ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'' [http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/index.php links]  to back-issue titles and abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' ====
These journals are published by the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]].  The ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' has been produced since 1919, and publishes research in the "economics of agriculture and food, natural resources and the environment, and rural and community development throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/ajae&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Applied Economics Perspectives and Policy'' ====
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy (AEPP) is the leading  peer-reviewed journal of applied economics and policy. Published four times per year by [[Oxford University Press]], it is the one of two journals published by the Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association (AAEA), along with the American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE). Today is the leading journal in 'applied economics' with a 2011 impact factor of 1.552.The purpose of AEPP is to analyze areas of current applied economic research in an effort to inform the policy-makers and decision makers; and to generate connections between sub-fields of agricultural and applied economics in order to focus future research and increase knowledge of those in the field about the impact of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaea.org/publications/aepp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==

Backhouse and Biddle argues that the mainstream view, that there is an accepted "theoretical core" and that this can be applied in a range of areas, relies on this core having specific characteristics. That is that it has a wide scope and can be developed independently of individual applications. But they note that as with the definition of applied economics itself, there is within the economics profession, differing views as to what belongs in the core. Where one draws the line between research that is contributing to the core and research that is applying the core, and the relative importance or significance of research on topics in the core versus applied economics research.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

Some examples of the problems of applied economics from various fields and issues:
* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Macroeconomics]]
One example of this is macroeconomics. In the 1960s and 1970s, macroeconomics was a part of the core of the subject. Why? Because macroeconomics was not only sufficiently important to be part of any economist's training, but also embodied a set of concepts and principles not found in microeconomic theory. However the replacement of Keynesian approach to macroeconomics with new classical macroeconomics and its successors, macroeconomics might now be regarded by the mainstream as merely an application of microeconomic theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Development economics|Development Economics]]
Another example is the situation within Development Economics. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s most development economist regarded  the application of standard "core" microeconomic theory to their area as being entirely inappropriate. An alternative set of models provided their core. This might be best described as the [[Structuralist economics|structuralist]] approach. More recently development economics texts have provided applications of mainstream core theory.&lt;ref name=backhouse /&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: [[Economic growth|Economic Growth Theory]]
Comim uses the history of the economics of growth in order to illustrate the historical nature of the concept of applied economics. He first discusses the perspective of the theorists’ views of the applied dimension of their work and examines each from the perspective of the work carried out at the Department of Applied Economics (DAE) at Cambridge University. He emphasizes the divergences concerning economists’ understanding of the proper use of economic theory, divergences that might ultimately reveal the influence of distinct practices as far as applied economics is concerned and the role of institutional environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comim |first=Flavio |year=2000 |title=On the Concept of Applied Economics: Lessons from Cambridge Economics and the History of Growth Theories |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=145–176 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examples of problems of applied economics: the [[Minimum-wage]] controversy
Leonard notes one area of disagreement amongst applied economists which became famous in the US. That was the minimum-wage controversy. He notes that the fierceness of this controversy was odd because the likely effects were small and that several seemingly more important policy issues such as (entitlement reform, health insurance, CPI calculation) generated nothing like the storm. His explanation is that while this controversy was not especially important to the economy, it was very important to economics and economics as a policy science. His explanation for this is that minimum wage research came to be seen as a test of the usefulness of applying neoclassical price theory to the wages and employment. In other words, it was not just a technical quarrel over such things as the sign and size of wage-elasticity but rather an installment in a long running  methodological dispute over whether neoclassical price theory is in reality of any use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leonard |first=Thomas C. |year=2000 |title=The Very Idea of Applying Economics: The Modern Minimum-Wage Controversy and Its Antecedents |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=117–144 |doi=10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A critique of the dominance of [[econometrics]]
Swann (2006) queries the dominance of such econometric techniques within Applied Economics and suggests what he describes as the "vernacular of the everyday practice of economics" should be taken seriously. Swann points out that econometrics's privileged position has not been supported by its disappointing results  and rather suggests other applied techniques, the vernacular, are also worthy of consideration. These approaches to applied economics, include simulation, [[Engineering economics (civil engineering)|engineering economics]], case studies and common sense.&lt;ref name=Swann /&gt;

{{about|the conservation biology topic|other uses of "BAP"|BAP (disambiguation)}}

A '''biodiversity action plan''' ('''BAP''') is an internationally recognized program addressing [[threatened species]] and [[habitat]]s and is designed to protect and restore biological systems. The original impetus for these plans derives from the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). As of 2009, 191 countries have ratified the CBD, but only a fraction of these have developed substantive BAP documents.

The principal elements of a BAP typically include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glowka |first=Lyle |author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin |author3=Hugh Synge |author4=Jeffrey A. McNeely |author5=Lothar Gündling |title=Guide to the Convention on Biodiversity |year=1994 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=2-8317-0222-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) preparing inventories of biological information for selected species or habitats; (b) assessing the [[conservation status]] of species within specified [[ecosystem]]s; (c) creation of targets for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]; and (d) establishing budgets, timelines and institutional partnerships for implementing the BAP.

==Species plans==
[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow leopard]], Pakistan, an endangered species]]

A fundamental method of engagement to a BAP is thorough documentation regarding individual species, with emphasis upon the population distribution and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status. This task, while fundamental, is highly daunting, since only an estimated ten percent of the world’s species are believed to have been characterized as of 2006,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these unknowns being [[fungi]], [[invertebrate]] animals, micro-organisms and plants. For many bird, mammal and reptile species, information is often available in published literature; however, for fungi, invertebrate animals, micro-organisms and many plants, such information may require considerable local data collection. It is also useful to compile time trends of population estimates in order to understand the dynamics of population variability and vulnerability. In some parts of the world complete species inventories are not realistic; for example, in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], many species are completely undocumented and much of the region has never even been systematically explored by scientists.

A species plan component of a country’s BAP should ideally entail a thorough description of the range, habitat, behaviour, breeding and interaction with other species. Once a determination has been made of conservation status (e.g. [[rare species|rare]], endangered, threatened, vulnerable), a plan can then be created to conserve and restore the species population to target levels. Examples of programmatic protection elements are: habitat restoration; protection of habitat from [[urban development]]; establishment of property ownership; limitations on grazing or other agricultural encroachment into habitat; reduction of [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural practises; outlawing killing or collecting the species; restrictions on pesticide use; and control of other environmental pollution. The plan should also articulate which public and private agencies should implement the protection strategy and indicate budgets available to execute this strategy.

==Habitat plans==
Where a number of threatened species depend upon a specific habitat, it may be appropriate to prepare a habitat protection element of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Examples of such special habitats are: raised acidic bogs of Scotland; [[Waterberg Biosphere]] [[bushveld]] in South Africa; California’s coastal [[wetland]]s; and Sweden’s [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[Öland]]. In this case also, careful inventories of species and also the geographic extent and quality of the habitat must be documented. Then, as with species plans, a program can be created to protect, enhance and/or restore habitat using similar strategies as discussed above under the species plans.

==Specific countries==
Some examples of individual countries which have produced substantive Biodiversity Action Plans follow. In every example the plans concentrate on plants and vertebrate animals, with very little attention to neglected groups such as fungi, invertebrate animals and micro-organisms, even though these are also part of biodiversity. Preparation of a country BAP may cost up to 100 million pounds sterling, with annual maintenance costs roughly ten percent of the initial cost. If plans took into account neglected groups, the cost would be higher. Obviously costs for countries with small geographical area or simplified ecosystems have a much lesser cost. For example, the St. Lucia BAP has been costed in the area of several million pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2001| author=Government of St. Lucia| title=National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of St. Lucia| url=http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113956/http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Australia has developed a detailed and rigorous Biodiversity Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2011| author=Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council| title=Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030| url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/au/au-nbsap-v2-en.pdf| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document estimates that the total number of indigenous species may be 560,000, many of which are endemic. A key element of the BAP is protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is actually in a much higher state of health than most of the world’s [[reef]]s, Australia having one of the highest percentages of treated [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005| author=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage| title=Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Annual Report 2004-2005| url=http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025646/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however,serious ongoing concerns, particularly in regards to the ongoing negative impact on water quality from land use practices. Also, climate change impact is feared to be significant.

Considerable analysis has been conducted on the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] yield of firewood production, a major threat to [[deforestation]] in most tropical countries. Biological inventory work; assessment of harvesting practices; and computer modeling of the dynamics of treefall, rot and harvest; have been carried out to adduce data on safe harvesting rates. Extensive research has also been conducted on the relation of brush clearance to [[biodiversity]] decline and impact on [[water table]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Glanznig, ''Native Vegetation Clearance, Habitat Loss and Biodiversity Decline: an overview of recent native vegetation clearance in Australia and its implications for biodiversity'', Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 6, Biodiversity Unit, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; for example, these effects have been analyzed in the [[Toolibin Lake]] wetlands region.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and as part of The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and Biodiversity Action Plans are implemented on ten separate themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dept. of Conservation; Ministry for the Environment| isbn = 978-0-478-21919-7| title = The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy| location = [Wellington, N.Z.]| date = February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government and some companies also have their own Biodiversity Action Plan.

===St. Lucia===
The [[St. Lucia]] BAP recognizes impacts of large numbers of tourists to the marine and coastal diversity of the [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] area of the country. The BAP specifically acknowledges that the [[carrying capacity]] for human use and [[water pollution]] discharge of sensitive reef areas was exceeded by the year 1990. The plan also addresses conservation of the historic island fishing industry. In 1992, several institutions in conjunction with native fishermen to produce a sustainable management plan for fishery resources, embodied in the Soufrière Marine Management Area.

The St. Lucia BAP features significant involvement from the [[University of the West Indies]]. Specific detailed attention is given to three species of threatened marine turtles, to a variety of vulnerable birds and a number of [[pelagic fish]]es and [[cetacean]]s. In terms of [[habitat conservation]] the plan focusses attention on the biologically productive [[mangrove]] swamps and notes that virtually all mangrove areas had already come under national protection by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Lucia National Marine Fisheries Act of 1984, Section 10'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
The Tanzania national BAP addresses issues related to sustainable use of [[Lake Manyara]], an extensive freshwater lake, whose usage by humans accelerated in the period 1950 to 1990. The designation of the [[Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve]] under [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] in 1981 combines conservation of the lake and surrounding high value forests with sustainable use of the wetlands area and simple agriculture. This BAP has united principal lake users in establishing management targets. The biosphere reserve has induced sustainable management of the wetlands, including monitoring [[groundwater]] and the chemistry of the [[escarpment]] water source.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Manyara|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=URT+01|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Fowlsheughclifftonorthsea.JPG|thumb|[[Fowlsheugh]] cliffs, [[Scotland]], a protected [[seabird]] breeding habitat]]
The [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] covers not only [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] species associated with lands within the UK, but also marine species and [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, which spend a limited time in the UK or its offshore waters. The UK plan encompasses "391 Species Action Plans, 45 Habitat Action Plans and 162 Local Biodiversity Action Plans with targeted actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2006| accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is noteworthy because of its extensive detail, clarity of endangerment mechanisms, specificity of actions, follow up monitoring program and its inclusion of migrating cetaceans and pelagic birds.

On August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) [launched in 1997] identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats in the UK that needed conservation and greater protection. The updated list included the [[hedgehog]], [[house sparrow]], [[grass snake]] and the [[garden tiger moth]], while [[otter]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[red squirrel]]s remained in need of habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6965681.stm BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' list]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the European Commission adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, in line with the commitments made at the 10th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework'.

==== UK BAP website ====
To support the work of the UK BAP, the UK BAP website was created by JNCC in 2001. The website contained information on the BAP process, hosted all relevant documents, and provided news and relevant updates. In March 2011, as part of the UK government’s review of websites, the UK BAP site was ‘closed’, and the core content was migrated into the JNCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5155| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2012| accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the original UK BAP website has been archived by the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] as snapshots from various dates (for example, UK ''BAP'': copy March 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan archive copy| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| author=National Archives, London| year=2011| accessdate=2012-10-28| deadurl=yes| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110303145238/http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| archivedate=March 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Twenty-six years prior to the international biodiversity convention, the United States had launched a national program to protect threatened species in the form of the 1966 [[Endangered Species Act]]. The legislation created broad authority for analyzing and listing species of concern, and mandated that Species [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Recovery Plan]]s be created. Thus, while the USA is an unratified signer of the accord, arguably it has the longest track record and most comprehensive program of species protection of any country. There are about 7000 listed species (e.g. endangered or threatened), of which about half have approved Recovery Plans. While this number of species seems high compared to other countries, the value is rather indicative of the total number of species characterized, which is extremely large.

===Uzbekistan===
Five major divisions of habitat have been identified in [[Uzbekistan]]’s BAP: Wetlands (including reed habitat and man-made [[marsh]]); desert ecosystems (including sandy, stony and clay); [[steppes]]; [[riparian]] ecosystems; and mountain ecosystems. Over 27,000 species have been inventoried in the country, with a high rate of [[endemism]] for fishes and reptiles. Principal threats to biodiversity are related to human activities associated with overpopulation and generally related to agricultural intensification.&lt;ref&gt;''Biodiversity Conservation National Strategy and Action Plan of Republic of Uzbekistan'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Major geographic regions encompassed by the BAP include the [[Aral Sea]] Programme (threatened by long-term drainage and [[salination]], largely for cotton production), the Nuratau Biosphere Reserve, and the Western [[Tien Shan Mountains]] Programme (in conjunction with [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some developing countries criticize the emphasis of BAPs, because these plans inherently favour consideration of [[wildlife]] protection above food and industrial production, and in some cases may represent an obstacle to population growth. The plans are costly to produce, a fact which makes it difficult for many smaller countries and poorer countries to comply. In terms of the plans themselves, many countries have adopted pro-forma plans including little research and even less in the way of natural resource management. Almost universally, this has resulted in plans which emphasize plants and vertebrate animals, and which overlook fungi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation| url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm| author=International Society for Fungal Conservation| year=2012| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate animals and micro-organisms. With regard to specific world regions, there is a notable lack of substantive participation by most of the Middle Eastern countries and much of Africa, the latter of which may be impeded by economic considerations of plan preparation. Some governments such as the [[European Union]] have diverted the purpose of a biodiversity action plan, and implemented the convention accord by a set of economic development policies with referencing certain ecosystems' protection.

==Biodiversity planning: a new way of thinking==
The definition of biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity now recognises that biodiversity is a combination of ecosystem structure and function, as much as its components e.g. species, habitats and genetic resources. Article 2 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''in addressing the boundless complexity of biological diversity, it has become conventional to think in hierarchical terms, from the genetic material within individual cells, building up through individual organisms, populations, species and communities of species, to the biosphere overall...At the same time, in seeking to make management intervention as efficient as possible, it is essential to take an holistic view of biodiversity and address the interactions that species have with each other and their non-living environment, i.e. to work from an ecological perspective.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ''“achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of life on Earth”.'' To achieve this outcome, biodiversity management will depend on maintaining structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, R.F. (1990) Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach. Conservation Biology 4 (4) 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is not singularly definable but may be understood via a series of management principles under BAPs, such as:

1. that biodiversity is conserved across all levels and scales – structure, function and composition are conserved at site, regional, state and national scales. 
2. that examples of all ecological communities are adequately managed for conservation.  
3. ecological communities are managed to support and enhance viable populations of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants and ecological functions.

Biodiversity and wildlife are not the same thing. The traditional focus on threatened species in BAPs is at odds with the principles of biodiversity management because, by the time species become threatened, the processes that maintain biodiversity are already compromised. Individual species are also regarded as generally poor indicators of biodiversity when it comes to actual planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmayer, D. B., Manning, A. D., Smith, P. L., Possingham, Hugh P., Fischer, J., Oliver, I., McCarthy, M. A., (2002) The Focal-Species Approach and Landscape Restoration: A Conservation Biology 16(2) 338–345&lt;/ref&gt; A species approach to BAPs only serves to identify and at best, apply a patch to existing problems. Increasingly, biodiversity planners are looking through the lens of [[ecosystem services]]. Critics of biodiversity are often confusing the need to protect species (their intrinsic value) with the need to maintain ecosystem processes, which ultimately maintain human society and do not compromise economic development. Hence, a core principle of biodiversity management, that traditional BAPs overlook, is the need to incorporate cultural, social and economic values in the process.

Modern day BAPs use an analysis of [[ecosystem services]], key ecological process drivers, and use species as one of many indicators of change. They would seek to maintain structure and function by addressing habitat connectivity and resilience and may look at communities of species (threatened or otherwise) as one method of monitoring outcomes. Ultimately, species are the litmus test for biodiversity – viable populations of species can only be expected to exist in relatively intact habitats. However, the rationale behind BAPs is to "conserve and restore" biodiversity. One of the fastest developing areas of management is [http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Biodiversity_Offsets biodiversity offsets]. The principles are in keeping with ecological impact assessment, which in turn depends on good quality BAPs for evaluation. Contemporary principles of biodiversity management, such as those produced by the [http://www.forest-trends.org/biodiversityoffsetprogram/ Business Biodiversity Offsets Program]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://eianzecology.blogspot.com/2009/03/principles-in-biodiversity-offsets.html|title= Principles in Biodiversity Offsets}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now integral to any plans to manage biodiversity, including the development of BAPs.

'''Cryptanalysis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kryptós'', "hidden", and ''analýein'', "to loosen" or "to untie") is the study of analyzing [[information system]]s in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/careers/career_fields/cryptsiganalysis.shtml |title=Cryptanalysis/Signals Analysis |publisher=Nsa.gov |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cryptanalysis is used to breach [[cryptographic]] security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] is unknown.

In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of [[side-channel attacks]] that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation.

Even though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography, adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper methods of the past, through machines like the British [[Bombe]]s and [[Colossus computer]]s at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[World War II]], to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present. Methods for breaking modern [[cryptosystem]]s often involve solving carefully constructed problems in [[pure mathematics]], the best-known being [[integer factorization]].

==Overview==
Given some encrypted data (''"[[ciphertext]]"''), the goal of the ''cryptanalyst'' is to gain as much information as possible about the original, unencrypted data (''"[[plaintext]]"''). It is useful to consider two aspects of achieving this. The first is ''breaking'' the system — that is discovering how the encipherment process works. The second is ''solving'' the key that is unique for a particular encrypted message or group of messages.

===Amount of information available to the attacker===
Attacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available. As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that, for the purposes of analysis, the general [[algorithm]] is known; this is [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's Maxim]] "the enemy knows the system"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude|title=Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=4 October 1949|volume=28|page=662|url=https://archive.org/stream/bstj28-4-656#page/n5/mode/2up|accessdate=20 June 2014|ref=Shannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; — in its turn, equivalent to [[Kerckhoffs' principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = David |last = Kahn |title = The Codebreakers: the story of secret writing  |year = 1996 |edition=second |publisher = Scribners |p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a reasonable assumption in practice — throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through [[espionage]], [[betrayal]] and [[reverse engineering]]. (And on occasion, ciphers have been broken through pure deduction; for example, the German [[Lorenz cipher]] and the Japanese [[Purple code]], and a variety of classical schemes):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmeh, Klaus|title=Cryptography and public key infrastructure on the Internet|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2003|isbn=978-0-470-84745-9|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NqidkUqHdgC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ciphertext-only attack|Ciphertext-only]]'': the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of [[ciphertext]]s or [[codetext]]s.
*''[[Known-plaintext attack|Known-plaintext]]'': the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which he knows the corresponding [[plaintext]].
*''[[Chosen plaintext attack|Chosen-plaintext]]'' (''[[chosen-ciphertext attack|chosen-ciphertext]]''): the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts (plaintexts) corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts (ciphertexts) of his own choosing.
*''[[Adaptive chosen plaintext attack|Adaptive chosen-plaintext]]'': like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions. Similarly ''[[Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]''.
*''[[Related-key attack]]'': Like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit.

===Computational resources required===
Attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require. Those resources include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellman|first=M.|date=July 1980|title=A cryptanalytic time-memory trade-off|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056220/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|language=en-US|volume=26|issue=4|pages=401–406|doi=10.1109/tit.1980.1056220|issn=0018-9448|via=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Time — the number of ''computation steps'' (e.g., test encryptions) which must be performed.
*Memory — the amount of ''storage'' required to perform the attack.
*Data — the quantity and type of ''plaintexts and ciphertexts'' required for a particular approach.

It's sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack isn't practical to actually implement for testing. But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated ''order of magnitude'' of their attacks' difficulty, saying, for example, "SHA-1 collisions now 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McDonald | first = Cameron | last2 = Hawkes | first2 = Philip | last3 = Pieprzyk | first3 = Josef | author3-link = Josef Pieprzyk | title =SHA-1 collisions now 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; | url = http://eurocrypt2009rump.cr.yp.to/837a0a8086fa6ca714249409ddfae43d.pdf | accessdate = 4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Schneier]] notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks: "Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force. Never mind that brute-force might require 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions; an attack requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised."&lt;ref name="schneier"/&gt;&lt;!-- Birthday attacks; man in the middle / time-memory tradeoff --&gt;

===Partial breaks===
The results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness. For example, cryptographer [[Lars Knudsen]] (1998) classified various types of attack on [[block cipher]]s according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:
*''Total break'' — the attacker deduces the secret [[key (cryptography)|key]].
*''Global deduction'' — the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent [[algorithm]] for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.
*''Instance (local) deduction'' — the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
*''Information deduction'' — the attacker gains some [[Information entropy|Shannon information]] about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
*''Distinguishing algorithm'' — the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random [[permutation]].

Academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem, such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed. Many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem,&lt;ref&gt;For an example of an attack that cannot be prevented by additional rounds, see [[slide attack]].&lt;/ref&gt; so it's possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak. Nonetheless, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the successful attacks on [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], [[MD5]], and [[SHA-1]] were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions.

In academic cryptography, a ''weakness'' or a ''break'' in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory, or known plaintexts. It also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can't: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key. Furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers. Finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking of the full system.&lt;ref name=schneier&gt;{{Harvnb|Schneier|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of cryptography}}
[[Image:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|right|The decrypted [[Zimmermann Telegram]].]]
Cryptanalysis has [[coevolution|coevolved]] together with cryptography, and the contest can be traced through the [[history of cryptography]]—new [[cipher]]s being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes. In practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history; the ability to read the presumed-secret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage. For example, in England in 1587, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was tried and executed for [[treason]] as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate [[Elizabeth I of England]]. The plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by [[Thomas Phelippes]].

In [[World War I]], the breaking of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] was instrumental in bringing the United States into the war. In [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the German ciphers — including the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz cipher]] — and Japanese ciphers, particularly [[Purple (cipher machine)|'Purple']] and [[JN-25]]. [[Ultra (cryptography)|'Ultra']] intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the European war by up to two years, to determining the eventual result. The war in the Pacific was similarly helped by [[Magic (cryptography)|'Magic']] intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for [[Military espionage|intelligence]], both military and diplomatic, and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations, for example, [[GCHQ]] and the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], organizations which are still very active today. In 2004, it was reported that the United States had broken [[Iran]]ian ciphers. (It is unknown, however, whether this was pure cryptanalysis, or whether other factors were involved:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3804895.stm | work=BBC News | title=Breaking codes: An impossible task? | date=June 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Classical ciphers===
[[Image:Al-kindi-cryptanalysis.png|thumb|right|First page of [[Al-Kindi]]'s 9th century ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'']]
{{See also|Frequency analysis|Index of coincidence|Kasiski examination}}

Although the actual word "''cryptanalysis''" is relatively recent (it was coined by [[William Friedman]] in 1920), methods for breaking [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s are much older. The first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by 9th-century [[Arabs|Arab]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=3xJjNG5CNdwC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Al+Kindi+Arab&amp;hl=ar&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsjMXP3ZvYAhUFthQKHQ2nCDk4HhDoAQgpMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Al%20Kindi%20Arab&amp;f=false/ History of Islamic philosophy: With View of Greek Philosophy and Early history of Islam P.199]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=2wS2CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=al+kindi+Arab&amp;hl=ar&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir87melZzYAhWCXBQKHTwOAKI4ChDoAQg1MAc#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20kindi%20Arab&amp;f=false/ The Biographical Encyclopedia of Islamic Philosophy P.279]&lt;/ref&gt; [[polymath]], [[Al-Kindi]] (also known as "Alkindus" in Europe), in ''A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages''. This treatise includes a description of the method of [[frequency analysis]] ([[Ibrahim Al-Kadi]], 1992- ref-3). [[Italy|Italian]] scholar [[Giambattista della Porta]] was author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis ''"De Furtivis Literarum Notis".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptool.org/content/view/28/54/lang,english/ Crypto History ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828190150/http://www.cryptool.org/content/view/28/54/lang%2Cenglish/ |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frequency analysis]] is the basic tool for breaking most [[classical cipher]]s. In natural languages, certain letters of the [[alphabet]] appear more often than others; in [[English language|English]], "[[E]]" is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of [[plaintext]]. Similarly, the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] "TH" is the most likely pair of letters in English, and so on. Frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these [[statistics]]. For example, in a [[simple substitution cipher]] (where each letter is simply replaced with another), the most frequent letter in the [[ciphertext]] would be a likely candidate for "E". Frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy, provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, the idea of a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] was developed, among others by the French diplomat [[Blaise de Vigenère]] (1523–96).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some three centuries, the [[Vigenère cipher]], which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure (''le chiffre indéchiffrable''—"the indecipherable cipher"). Nevertheless, [[Charles Babbage]] (1791–1871) and later, independently, [[Friedrich Kasiski]] (1805–81) succeeded in breaking this cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=63–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries developed [[rotor cipher machine]]s such as [[Arthur Scherbius]]' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigenère system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ciphers from World War I and World War II===
{{See also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher}}
Cryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II. [[F. W. Winterbotham]], quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], at the war's end as describing [[Ultra]] intelligence as having been "decisive" to Allied victory.{{sfn|Winterbotham|2000|p=229}} [[Harry Hinsley|Sir Harry Hinsley]], official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment about Ultra, saying that it shortened the war "by not less than two years and probably by four years"; moreover, he said that in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}}

In practice, frequency analysis relies as much on [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge as it does on statistics, but as ciphers became more complex, [[mathematics]] became more important in cryptanalysis. This change was particularly evident before and during [[World War II]], where efforts to crack [[Axis Powers|Axis]] ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication. Moreover, automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]] device, the British [[Bombe]], the use of [[punched card]] equipment, and in the [[Colossus computers]] — the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indicator====
With reciprocal machine ciphers such as the [[Lorenz cipher]] and the [[Enigma machine]] used by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], each message had its own key. Usually, the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext and/or ciphertext before the enciphered message. This is termed the ''indicator'', as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp=33, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish cryptographers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|pp=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the British cryptographers at [[Bletchley Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; to break the Enigma cipher system. Similar poor indicator systems allowed the British to identify ''depths'' that led to the diagnosis of the [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ40/42]] cipher system, and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine.&lt;ref name="Tutte 1998"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tutte|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth====
Sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process. To a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be ''"in depth."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be detected by the messages having the same ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]'' by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the [[Key (cryptography)|key generator initial settings]] for the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp= 33, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages. For example, the [[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam cipher]] enciphers by bit-for-bit combining plaintext with a long key using the "[[exclusive or]]" operator, which is also known as "[[Modular arithmetic|modulo-2 addition]]" (symbolized by ⊕ ):
::::Plaintext ⊕ Key = Ciphertext
Deciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext:
::::Ciphertext ⊕ Key = Plaintext 
(In modulo-2 arithmetic, addition is the same as subtraction.) When two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth, combining them eliminates the common key, leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts:
::::Ciphertext1 ⊕ Ciphertext2 = Plaintext1 ⊕ Plaintext2
The individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying ''probable words'' (or phrases), also known as ''"cribs,"'' at various locations; a correct guess, when combined with the merged plaintext stream, produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component:
::::(Plaintext1 ⊕ Plaintext2) ⊕ Plaintext1 = Plaintext2
The recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions, and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext. Working back and forth between the two plaintexts, using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses, the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts. (With only two plaintexts in depth, the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext, but in practice this is not a large problem.) When a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext, the key is revealed:
::::Plaintext1 ⊕ Ciphertext1 = Key
Knowledge of a key of course allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key, and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them.&lt;ref name="Tutte 1998"/&gt;

===Development of modern cryptography===
[[Image:TuringBombeBletchleyPark.jpg|thumb|The [[Bombe]] replicated the action of several [[Enigma machine]]s wired together. Each of the rapidly rotating drums, pictured above in a [[Bletchley Park]] museum mockup, simulated the action of an Enigma rotor.]]

Even though computation was used to great effect in [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]] and other systems during World War II, it also made possible new methods of cryptography [[orders of magnitude]] more complex than ever before. Taken as a whole, modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the pen-and-paper systems of the past, and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] notes:

{{quote|Many are the cryptosystems offered by the hundreds of commercial vendors today that cannot be broken by any known methods of cryptanalysis. Indeed, in such systems even a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]], in which a selected plaintext is matched against its ciphertext, cannot yield the key that unlock[s] other messages. In a sense, then, cryptanalysis is dead. But that is not the end of the story. Cryptanalysis may be dead, but there is - to mix my metaphors - more than one way to skin a cat.|&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] [https://fas.org/irp/eprint/kahn.html Remarks on the 50th Anniversary of the National Security Agency], November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception, [[bugging]], [[side channel attack]]s, and [[quantum cryptography|quantum computers]] as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis. In 2010, former NSA technical director Brian Snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are "moving very slowly forward in a mature field."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Greene, Network World, [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/030410-rsa-cloud-security-warning.html Former NSA tech chief: I don't trust the cloud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308105556/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/030410-rsa-cloud-security-warning.html |date=2010-03-08 }}. Retrieved March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature. While the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown, many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

*The [[block cipher]] [[Madryga]], proposed in 1984 but not widely used, was found to be susceptible to [[ciphertext-only attack]]s in 1998.
*[[FEAL|FEAL-4]], proposed as a replacement for the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] standard encryption algorithm but not widely used, was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community, many of which are entirely practical.
*The [[A5/1]], [[A5/2]], [[CMEA (cipher)|CMEA]], and [[DECT Standard Cipher|DECT]] systems used in [[mobile phone|mobile]] and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours, minutes or even in real-time using widely available computing equipment.
*[[Brute-force search|Brute-force keyspace search]] has broken some real-world ciphers and applications, including single-DES (see [[EFF DES cracker]]), [[Cryptography#Export controls|40-bit "export-strength" cryptography]], and the [[Content Scrambling System|DVD Content Scrambling System]].
*In 2001, [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), a protocol used to secure [[Wi-Fi]] [[wireless network]]s, was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the [[RC4]] cipher and aspects of the WEP design that made [[related-key attack]]s practical. WEP was later replaced by [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]].
*In 2008, researchers conducted a proof-of-concept break of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] using weaknesses in the [[MD5]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hash function]] and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit [[collision attack]]s on hash functions. The certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated.

Thus, while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], cryptanalysis and the broader field of [[information security]] remain quite active.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Asymmetric ciphers==
[[Asymmetric cryptography]] (or [[public key cryptography]]) is cryptography that relies on using two (mathematically related) keys; one private, and one public. Such ciphers invariably rely on "hard" [[mathematical problem]]s as the basis of their security, so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem. The security of two-key cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that single-key cryptography generally does not, and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Asymmetric schemes are designed around the (conjectured) difficulty of solving various mathematical problems. If an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem, then the system is weakened. For example, the security of the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the [[discrete logarithm]]. In 1983, [[Don Coppersmith]] found a faster way to find discrete logarithms (in certain groups), and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups (or different types of groups). RSA's security depends (in part) upon the difficulty of [[integer factorization]] — a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of RSA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 1980, one could factor a difficult 50-digit number at an expense of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; elementary computer operations. By 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75-digit number could be factored in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations. Advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster, too. [[Moore's law]] predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase. Factoring techniques may continue to do so as well, but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity, neither of which has ever been successfully predictable. 150-digit numbers of the kind once used in RSA have been factored. The effort was greater than above, but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers. By the start of the 21st century, 150-digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough [[key size]] for RSA. Numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005, though methods will probably continue to improve over time, requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as [[elliptic curve cryptography]] to be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that, unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems, any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the [[public key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stallings|first=William|title=Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0136097049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum computing applications for cryptanalysis==
[[Quantum computer]]s, which are still in the early phases of research, have potential use in cryptanalysis. For example, [[Shor's Algorithm]] could factor large numbers in [[polynomial time]], in effect breaking some commonly used forms of public-key encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2014/04/30/shors-algorithm-breaking-rsa-encryption|title=Shor's Algorithm – Breaking RSA Encryption|date=2014-04-30|newspaper=AMS Grad Blog|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer, brute-force key search can be made quadratically faster. However, this could be countered by doubling the key length.&lt;ref name=djb-groverr&gt;{{cite journal |date=2010-03-03 |author=[[Daniel J.

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

==Ancient Greek science==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

{{quote|Aristotle described at length what was involved in having scientific knowledge of something. To be scientific, he said, one must deal with causes, one must use logical demonstration, and one must identify the universals which 'inhere' in the particulars of sense. But above all, to have science one must have ''[[Apodicticity|apodictic certainty]]''. It is the last feature which, for Aristotle, most clearly distinguished the scientific way of knowing.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;|[[Larry Laudan]]|''Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis'', "The Demise of the Demarcation Problem"}}
In Charmides Plato discusses a "science of science". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable secondary source.|date=August 2018}}

[[G. E. R. Lloyd]] notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to "legitimate their own positions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

==Logical positivism==
[[Logical positivism]], formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled "[[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|metaphysics]]" (see [[the verifiability theory of meaning]] also known as [[verificationism]]). This distinction between science, which in the view of the [[Vienna Circle]] possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called "metaphysics", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=demarcation+%22logical+positivism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9n8U7vdEuKw7AbYgIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=demarcation%20%22logical%20positivism%22&amp;f=false Grayling, AC., ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, "The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#LogPos |at=4.1 The Logical Positivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsifiability==
[[Falsifiability]] is the demarcation criterion proposed by [[Karl Popper]] as opposed to verificationism: "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#KarPop |at=4.2 Falsificationism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science.  Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

{{quote|Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science… and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific… According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it "has the untoward consequence of countenancing as 'scientific' every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions". Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted… Similarly, the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

In Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of "the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences," so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable "if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature.  For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved.  Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1974) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348844/ The Rationality of Scientific Discovery] Philosophy of Science, 41 (2) 123-153; 1998 [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press, Oxford; 2017 [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress] Paragon House, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpositivism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]], an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called [[postpositivism]] or [[postempiricism]]. In his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called [[normal science]] and [[extraordinary science]] (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt; That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

{{quote|Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, [[subjectivity|subjective]] quality of scientific change. [[Paul Feyerabend]] was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A. |last=Taylor |year=1996 |title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation |series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299150341 |lccn=96000180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both [[Imre Lakatos]] and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
[[Paul R. Thagard]] has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely "unpromising" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became "pseudoscience" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful [[ignorance]] of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians' perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge.  In the article on science in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh edition]] of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the scientist and historian [[William Cecil Dampier Whetham]] defined science as "ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dampier Whetham | first = William Cecil | author-link = William Cecil Dampier Whetham | publication-date = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = Science | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = New York | url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his study of Greek science, [[Marshall Clagett]] defined science as "first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett
| publication-date = 1963 | title = Greek Science in Antiquity | publisher = Collier Books | publication-place = New York | page = 4 | isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition appeared more recently in [[David Pingree]]'s study of early science: "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | year = 1992 | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume  = 83 | pages = 554–563 | doi=10.1086/356288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes "problematic, if not futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | editor-last = Fountain | editor-first = John W. | editor2-last = Sinclair | editor2-first = Rolf M. | publication-date = 2005 | title = Current Studies in Archaeoastronomy: Conversations Across Time and Space | chapter = Different Astronomies, Different Cultures and the Question of Cultural Relativism | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | publication-place = Durham, NC | page = 71 | isbn = 0-89089-771-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laudan==
[[Larry Laudan]] concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that "philosophy has failed to deliver the goods" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience.  None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else.  He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded.  He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as {{lang|fr|machines de guerre}} in polemical disputes between "scientists" and "pseudo-scientists."  Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not.  In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not.  He would consign phrases like "pseudo-science" or "unscientific" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;

Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;  Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lutz |first=Sebastian |title=On an Allegedly Essential Feature of Criteria for the Demarcation of Science |journal=The Reasoner |pages=125–126 |volume=5 |number=8 |year=2011 |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5(8).pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109143743/http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5%288%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. [[Massimo Pigliucci]] wrote that science generally conforms to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s concept of [[family resemblance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, Massimo]] (2013). "The Demarcation Problem: A (Belated) Response to Laudan" in Pigliucci, Massimo; [[Maarten Boudry|Boudry, Maarten]], eds. ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'' chapter 1.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-05196-3}}. Pigliucci's chapter is available online at http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGTDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Concerning [[science education]], Michael D. Gordin wrote:&lt;ref name=Gordin&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2015) "Myth 27. That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience", in ''Newton’s Apple and other Myths about Science'', [[Ronald L. Numbers]] editor, [[Harvard University Press]] {{doi|10.4159/9780674089167-029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}
:Every student in public or private takes several years of science, but only a small fraction of them pursue careers in the sciences. We teach the rest of them so much science so that they will appreciate what it ''means'' to be scientific – and, hopefully, become scientifically literate and apply some of those lessons in their lives. For such students, the myth of a bright line of demarcation is essential.
Discussions of the demarcation problem highlight the [[rhetoric of science]] and promote [[critical thinking]]. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in [[public policy|policy discussion]], contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated
:Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines.&lt;ref name=Gordin/&gt;{{rp|225}}
The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating [[fake news]] from real news, which rose to prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=LeVine |first=Michael V |title=Science has experience fighting fake news — and Facebook should take note |url=https://mic.com/articles/161376/science-has-experience-fighting-fake-news-and-facebook-should-take-note#.m62pUua8z |year=2016 |journal=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FreeHand MusicPad Pro + Roland Fantom G8 (clipped).jpg|thumb|'''Digital sheet music''' used by &lt;br/&gt;[[Jordan Rudess]]&lt;br/&gt; (''FreeHand MusicPad Pro'')]]

'''Digital sheet music''' is technology for representing and displaying sheet music in a computer-readable format. With the emergence of several technological innovations, sheet music evolved in several stages into what was to be termed digital sheet music.

==Music Notation Software==
With the increased use of professional and personal computers during the 1980s, different programmers{{Who|date=January 2016}} started working on desktop publishing music notation software. Various boxed music notation software applications appeared on the market, allowing users to input and edit sheet music digitally. In the beginning, the software only permitted printing on paper. It took some time before other virtual formats became possible (e.g. standard [[MIDI]] file, audio (wav, [[MP3|mp3]]) and [[MusicXML]] export). These files allowed manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and even MIDI playback. In particular, software projects [[Finale (software)|Finale]] and [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] grew to become successful commercial products and to define certain standards in digital music notation. Many free software projects also appeared (see [[list of scorewriters]]). Consequently, computer keyboard entry in combination with synthesizer keyboard entry became the most common method for music data entry in current digital use.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30204846?uid=3737592&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103426321863 |last=Bainbridge |first=D. |last2=Bell |first2=T. |year=2001 |title=The Challenge of Optical Music Recognition |journal=Computers and the Humanities |volume=35 |issue= |pages=95–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OMR==
[[Optical music recognition]] (OMR) is software to “read” scanned sheet music. Although OMR contributed to the evolution of digital sheet music, it is currently still a complex problem.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While the earliest attempts of OMR were made in the early 1970s, the first commercial products appeared in the early 90s. Currently, many commercial OMR tools are  available: SharpEye2, SmartScore, Photoscore, CapellaScan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1245321 |last1=Bellini |first1=P. |last2=Bruno |first2=I. |last3=Nesi |first3=P. |year=2007 |title=Assessing optical music recognition tools |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=68–93 |doi=10.1162/comj.2007.31.1.68}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMR can be simplified into four smaller tasks: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification and musical semantics (Bainbridge &amp; Bell, 2001). However, in most cases,s these systems operate only properly with well-scanned documents of high quality. When it comes to precision and reliability, none of the commercial OMR systems solve the problem in a satisfactory way.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Especially since the tradition of notating music is quite diffuse and varied, it remains difficult to reduce its aesthetics to a few principles for a machine to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220961410_Musical_interaction_patterns_communicating_computer_music_knowledge_in_a_multidisciplinary_project |last1=Brandorff |first1=S. |last2=Lindholm |first2=M. |last3=Christensen |first3=H. B. |year=2005 |title=A tutorial on design patterns for music notation software |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=42–54 |doi=10.1162/0148926054798179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New commercial possibilities==
With the emergence of electronic commerce in the 2000s, some traditional sheet publishers, as well as new entrants, developed online retailer websites to offer sheet music in an electronic manner. The first to offer the service online was Sheet Music Direct (1997) but quickly followed by MusicNotes and Sheet Music Score who were able to offer interactive features like transposition and change of instrument using scorch (Avid) technology. New comer [[Sheet Music Plus]] only recently (2011) entered the market, offering PDF files only. Those commercial services started as worldwide retailers with a large base of licensed sheet music and fast delivery, but progressively offered digital print, ranging from PDF-files to more dynamic offerings such as Scorch technology (Avid) which allowed for midi accompaniment, and on-the-fly change of keys and instruments. In addition, the popular use of digital sheet music required interchangeable digital formats. As such, [[MusicXML]] became a common format to share sheet music files between applications and to archive sheet music files for future use.

==Apps==
The digital revolution of the 2010s introduced widespread use of mobile networked devices, mobile telephony and tablet computers. Tablet computers, in particular, introduced new opportunities for digital sheet music through their usable digital display (IBISWorld, 2011, 2013). Consequently, many [[iOS]] and [[Android app]]s were introduced in the sheet music market, offering digital sheet music on various mobile platforms. The first generation viewers displayed [[PDF]]-files with features such as basic annotations, exportation of those annotations to other PDF readers and printing scores. PDFs are “static” files: you can read the music as it appears on the page, and you can only modify the notes by drawing digital ink markings or by typing text on the page (Hugh, 2013).

==Cloud-based Apps==
Most recently, the rise of cloud computing is further pushing the development of digital sheet music and enables creating and sharing written music online. A cloud-based application is immediately available on the web on any type of computer and does not need to be installed. [[HTML5]] in particular spurs cloud computing, allowing development of device independent web applications and making digital sheet music responsive and appropriate on large as well as on small screens. Cloud-based music notation applications facilitate the creation and sharing of written music. Additionally, other cloud-based applications focus more on the practice and consumption side of music learning. These latter cloud-based applications integrate audio-output such as playback with a variety of tempi (speeds) and with different instrumentation for multi-part scores and make the viewing and playing more interactive by adding personal annotations, automatic page turning, or set lists.

==Reading digital sheet music==

Overall, four factors appear to facilitate digital sheet reading: computer, content, containers and controllers (Hugh, 2013):
# Computer: depending on the musical work or performance, different form factors might facilitate the digital sheet music consumption
# Content: a choice of static content versus dynamic content, and a choice of open content versus proprietary content. 
# Containers: hardware accessories used to hold or mount your computer
# Controllers: hardware accessories that enable you to work with your digital sheet music in a variety of ways, ranging from digital pens to draw annotations, to pedals and other switches that allow you to turn the pages without using your hands.

'''Dynamic Earth''' (originally known as Our Dynamic Earth) is a visitor attraction in [[Edinburgh]], and also functions as a conference venue. It is in the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] area, beside the [[Scottish Parliament building]] and at the foot of [[Holyrood Park#Salisbury Crags|Salisbury Crags]].

The principal focus of Dynamic Earth is to facilitate a better public understanding of the processes that have shaped the Earth (known as [[earth science]]). This includes the [[Big Bang]], [[abiogenesis]], [[plate tectonics]] and [[glaciers|glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/visit/what-is-dynamic-earth |title=What is Dynamic Earth |publisher=Our Dynamic Earth |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The centre opened in 1999 as one of the first major projects supported by the [[Millennium Commission]]. The project was part of an [[urban regeneration]] plan for former industrial land at the lower end of Holyrood Road.

In the years 2006−2007 there were more than 200,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/our-dynamic-earth-celebrates-as-holyrood-doubles-its-funds-1-1240449 |title=Our Dynamic Earth celebrates as Holyrood doubles its funds |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=11 January 2008  |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The building's structure consists of a steel mast-supported membrane stretched over a steel skeleton. It was designed by architects [[Hopkins Architects|Michael Hopkins and Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkins.co.uk/projects/1/75 |title=Dynamic Earth |publisher=Hopkins Architects |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design incorporates the original wall that formed the outer perimeter of the Abbey Brewery ale stores that were formerly on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/blog/old-town-new-life-four-transformed-buildings-in-edinburgh |title=Old Town, new life: four transformed buildings in Edinburgh |first=Gareth |last=Davies |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=26 May 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre's Scientific Director is the British television and radio presenter specialising in [[scientific]] and [[educational]] programmes [[Hermione Cockburn]]

An early life stage (ELS) test is a chronic toxicity test using sensitive early life stages like embryos or larvae to predict the effects of toxicants on organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985"&gt;McKim JM. 1985. Early life stage toxicity tests. In Rand GM (1995). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp 974–1010. {{ISBN|1-56032-091-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ELS tests were developed to be quicker and more cost-efficient than full life-cycle tests, taking on average 1–5 months to complete compared to 6–12 months for a life-cycle test. They are commonly used in [[aquatic toxicology]], particularly with fish. Growth and survival are the typically measured endpoints, for which a [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration]] (MATC) can be estimated. ELS tests allow for the testing of fish species that otherwise could not be studied due to length of life, spawning requirements, or size. ELS tests are used as part of environmental risk assessments by regulatory agencies including the [[EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and [[Environment Canada]], as well as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name="EPAEEC"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm Technical Overview of Ecological Risk Assessment Analysis Phase: Ecological Effects Characterization.] US EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDFELS"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 1992. Guideline 210: Fish early-life stage toxicity test. ''OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
ELS tests were adapted from full life-cycle toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; These are widely considered to be the best tests for estimating long-term "safe" concentrations of toxicants in aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the [[fathead minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''),&lt;ref name="Mount Stephan"&gt;Mount DI, Stephan CE. 1967. A method for establishing acceptable limits for fish-Malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D. ''Trans Am Fish Soc'' 96:185-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit DA, Puglisi FA, Olson DL. 1982. A fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') early life stage toxicity test method evaluation and exposure to four organic chemicals. ''Environ Pollution Series A, Ecological and Biological'' 28:189-197.&lt;/ref&gt; and later for [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[brook trout]] (''Salvelinus fontinalis''), [[flagfish]] (''Jordanella floridae''), and [[sheepshead minnow]] (''Cyprinodon variegatus'').&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen DJ, Parrish PR, Schimmel SC, Goodman LR. 1978. Life-cycle toxicity test using sheepshead minnows (''Cyprinodon variegatus''). ''Bioassay Procedures for the Ocean Disposal Permit Program'', EPA-600/9-78-010.&lt;/ref&gt; While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Typically, life-cycle tests take 6–12 months for [[fathead minnow]] and 30 months for [[brook trout]].

Following the passage of the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA) in the [[United States]] in 1976, there was an increased need for quicker, more efficient vertebrate toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; The [[EPA]] was now required to assess the environmental effects of new chemicals before they could be commercially produced. Less costly and time-intensive tests were needed to evaluate a multitude of new chemicals. Researchers began developing toxicity tests that focused on early life stages, since these have been shown to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than later life stages.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Many critical events occur in a short period of time in the early stages of development.&lt;ref name="McKim 1977"&gt;McKim JM. 1977. Evaluation of tests with early life stages of fish for predicting long-term toxicity. ''J Fish Res Board Can'' 34:1148–1154.&lt;/ref&gt; If a stressor disrupts developmental events (including their timing), it could result in adverse effects that reduce the organism's chances of survival. Meta-analysis has found that early life-cycle portions of full life-cycle tests usually estimate an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] within a factor of 2 of full life-cycle estimates in saltwater and freshwater fish.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKim 1977" /&gt; In 83% of 72 tests, the ELS portion resulted in the same [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] as the full life-cycle estimate, and the remaining 17% were within a factor of 2.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt;

==Limitations==
There remain some limitations with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds of fish and 1 to 5 months to complete.&lt;ref name="villeneuve"&gt;Villeneuve D, Volz DC, Embry MR, Ankley GT, Belanger SE, Léonard M, Schirmer K, Tanguay R, Truong L, Wehmas L. 2014. Investigating alternatives to the fish early-life stage test: a strategy for discovering and annotating adverse outcome pathways for early fish development. ''Environ Toxicol Chem'' 33:158-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's [[mechanism of action]]. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATCs]] are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This could be due to the [[mode of action]] of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; Additionally, growth response has been found to be an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]].&lt;ref&gt;Woltering DM. 1984. The growth response in fish chronic and early life stage toxicity tests: A critical review. ''Aquat Toxicol'' 5:1–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.

==Methodology==
In a typical early life stage toxicity test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers.&lt;ref name="McKim 1985" /&gt; At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested, plus controls, with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment. The length of the exposure depends on the test species. For example, [[fathead minnow]] tests are 1–2 months long, while [[brook trout]] tests are around 5 months long. Growth and survival are the typical endpoints, for which an [[Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration|MATC]] can be found.

Standard methods for ELS tests have been established by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]],&lt;ref name="OECDFELS" /&gt; [[ASTM International]],&lt;ref&gt;ASTM International. Standard Guide for Conducting Early Life-Stage Toxicity Tests with Fishes, designation E1241. Conshohochen (PA): Annual book of ASTM standards.

==Current developments==
An extended ELS test has been examined as a potential surrogate for a fish full life-cycle test to detect weak environmental estrogens.&lt;ref name="panter"&gt;Panter GH, Hutchinson TH, Hurd KS, Bamforth J, Stanley RD, Duffell S, Hargreaves A, Gimeno S, Tyler CR. 2006. Development of chronic tests for endocrine active chemicals: Part 1. An extended fish early-life stage test for oestrogenic active chemicals in the fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') ''Aquat Toxicol'' 77:279-290.&lt;/ref&gt; Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) are ubiquitous in the environment, prompting the need for better screening assays to predict their effects, especially in aquatic species. Slightly longer ELS tests could be used instead of full life-cycle tests, taking into account sensitive windows of exposure like sexual differentiation and early gonadal development. Extended ELS tests have proven successful in detecting the effects of weak estrogens in [[fathead minnow]]s.&lt;ref name="panter" /&gt;

Additionally, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are being used to develop an alternative to FELS testing.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt; Industry and regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in an animal-free, cost-efficient surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;Knapen D, Vergauwen L, Verstraelen S, Dardenne F, Witters H, Blust R, Villeneuve DL, Ankley GT. 2013. Development of an alternative testing strategy for the fish early life-stage for predicting chronic toxicity." ''Toxicology Letters'' 221: S104.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are developing FELS-related AOPs to create a high-throughput, less costly screening strategy for toxicants that takes the [[mechanism of action]] into account.&lt;ref name="villeneuve" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16674">'''Earth section paths''' are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a [[reference ellipsoid]] and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated [[geodesy|geodetic problems]].

== The Indirect Problem ==
The indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, of the short arc of a spheroid section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) [[azimuth]]s of that curve, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P_k&lt;/math&gt; have geodetic latitude  &lt;math&gt;\phi_k&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using [[analytic geometry]] in [[ECEF]] coordinates.
Let &lt;math&gt;R_1=ECEF(P_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2=ECEF(P_2)&lt;/math&gt; be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

=== Section plane ===
To define the section plane select any third point &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; not on the line from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to be on the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; will define the normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, &lt;math&gt;lx + my + nz = d&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\ l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, requires the components of a [[unit vector]], &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_0=R_1 - R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vector from &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;V_1=R_2 - R_1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;unit(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The orientation convention used here is that &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; = -&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the [[dot product]] of &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. d = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}\cdot{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; ⋅ &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = d, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of (x, y, z).

=== Azimuth ===
A unit vector pointing up at any point on the ellipsoid is: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(\cos\phi\cos\lambda,\cos\phi\sin\lambda,\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, a unit vector pointing north is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\phi\cos\lambda,-\sin\phi\sin\lambda,\cos\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and east is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(-\sin\lambda,\cos\lambda,0)&lt;/math&gt;. A vector tangent to the path is:
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}= \hat{N} \times \mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; so the east component of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the north component is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a [[atan2|two-argument arctangent function]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e}},\mathbf{t}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}})&lt;/math&gt;. Use this method at both &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Section Ellipse ===
The (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, on the section path from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[elliptic integral]] that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.
Let the ellipsoid given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{l^2+m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
If p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

If p&gt;0 then Gilbertson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbertson|first1=Charles|title=Earth Section Paths|journal=Navigation|date=Spring 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1-7|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/navi.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is &lt;math&gt;{R_c}=\frac{d}{C}(la^2, ma^2, nb^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C=a^2p^2+b^2n^2&lt;/math&gt;,

the semi-major axis is &lt;math&gt;a^*=a\sqrt{1-\frac{d^2}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}=(\frac{m}{p}, \frac{-l}{p}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, and
the semi-minor axis is &lt;math&gt;b^*=\frac{b}{\sqrt{C}}a^*&lt;/math&gt;,  in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}=(\frac{ln}{p}, \frac{mn}{p}, -p)&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution if &lt;math&gt;|d|&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arc Length ===
The polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is &lt;math&gt;R(\theta)= \frac{b^*}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e^2=1-\frac{(b^*)^2}{(a^*)^2}&lt;/math&gt;, relates to the ellipse eccentricity,  not the spheroid eccentricity (see [[ellipse]]). Let P be a point on the ellipse and &lt;math&gt;R=ECEF(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then the vector from &lt;math&gt;{R_c}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;R-R_c&lt;/math&gt;. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{w}}=unit(R-R_c)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\mathbf{\hat{w}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta =\operatorname{atan2}(\sin\theta,\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way we obtain the central angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt; \theta_2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;\theta_1  + \pi &lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[arc length]] along the ellipse is given by &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; =&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \sqrt{R^2+(R^')^2}d\theta.&lt;/math&gt; Substituting &lt;math&gt;r(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in 
&lt;math&gt;s_{12} = ArcLength(\theta_1,\theta_2) = b^*({c_0}\Delta\theta + {c_1}\Delta s2 + {c_2}\Delta s4 + {c_3}\Delta s6)&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta\theta&amp;=\theta_2-\theta_1,\\[6pt]
\Delta s2&amp;=\sin(2\theta_2)-\sin(2\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s4&amp;=\sin(4\theta_2)-\sin(4\theta_1),\\[6pt]
\Delta s6&amp;=\sin(6\theta_2)-\sin(6\theta_1),\\[6pt]
{c_0}&amp;=1+e^2(4096 + 3328e^2 + 2880e^4 + 2577e^6 + 16860e^8)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_1}&amp;=e^2(512 + 384e^2 + 380e^4 + 385e^6 + 3408e^8)/4096,\\[6pt]
{c_2}&amp;=-e^4(64 + 80e^2 + 19e^4 - 3516e^6)/16384,\\[6pt]
{c_3}&amp;=-e^6(60 + 105e^2 - 528e^4)/12288.\\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, expansions for the [[Meridian arc]] may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.

== The Direct Problem ==
The direct problem is given &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, the distance, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and departure azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; and the arrival azimuth, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Section plane ===
Construct the tangent vector at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}= \mathbf\hat{n_1}\cos{\alpha_1} + \mathbf{\hat{e_1}}\sin{\alpha_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;. Pick a vector,  &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; must not be in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{n_1} ,\mathbf{\hat{e_1}}&lt;/math&gt;} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;, so no path would result). The normal vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;unit(V_0&lt;/math&gt;×&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{t_1}&lt;/math&gt;),  together with &lt;math&gt;{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; defines the plane.
=== Locate &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;===
This is a 2-d problem in span{&lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{i^*} , \mathbf\hat{j^*}&lt;/math&gt;},  which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as 
&lt;math&gt;V={V_c} + {r(\theta)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
To get an initial estimate of &lt;math&gt;{\theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;{V_1}={R_1}-R{_c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\theta_1}&lt;/math&gt;=Central_Angle&lt;math&gt;({V_1})&lt;/math&gt; (see the arc length section above),
&lt;math&gt;{r_1}=r({\theta_1})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\theta=\frac{\delta}{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now initialize &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 + \Delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and iterate the following steps:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= ArcLength({\theta_1}, {\theta_2}),\\[6pt]
Err &amp;= \delta - s,\\[6pt]
s'({\theta}) &amp;= \frac{b^*}{(1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta)}\sqrt{\frac{(1-(2-e^2) e^2 \cos^2 \theta}{1-e^2 \cos^2 \theta}},\\[6pt]
\Delta\theta &amp;= \frac{Err}{s'({\theta_2})}, \\[6pt]
\theta_2 &amp;= \theta_2 + \Delta\theta, \\[6pt]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
exit when &lt;math&gt;abs(\Delta\theta) &lt; 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt;

No more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.
Finally, let &lt;math&gt;{V_2}={V_c} + {r(\theta_2)}(\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}\cos\theta_2+\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}\sin\theta_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{P_2}&lt;/math&gt; = ECEF_to_Geo&lt;math&gt;({V_2})&lt;/math&gt; using Bowring’s 1985 algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The accuracy of geodetic latitude and height equations|journal=Survey Review|date=1985|volume=28|issue=218|pages=202-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the algorithm [[Geographic coordinate conversion|here]].

Alternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.

=== Azimuth ===
Azimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: &lt;math&gt;{\alpha_2}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{e_2}},\mathbf{t_2}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n_2}})&lt;/math&gt;, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
=== The great ellipse ===
Let &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; be the origin, so that &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; = the position vector of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The Direct and Inverse Solutions for the Great Elliptic Line on the Reference Ellipsoid|journal=Bulletin Geodesique|date=1984|volume=58|issue=1|pages=101-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal sections ===
The normal section at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; (the surface normal at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowring|first1=B.R.|title=The normal section -- forward and inverse formulae at any distance|journal=Survey Review|date=1971|volume=XXI|issue=161|pages=131-136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The mean normal section ===
The mean normal section from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is determined by letting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; =  &lt;math&gt;0.5(\mathbf\hat{u_1}+\mathbf\hat{u_2})&lt;/math&gt;. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; for aviation or sailing.

=== A class of sections ===
A class of sections may be imagined by rotating &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; about the chord connecting &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2.&lt;/math&gt; All of these may be solved with the single approach above.

== Intersections ==
Let two section planes be given: &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;⋅&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = \hat{N_1} \times \hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; are not colinear &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exist constants &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, where t is an independent parameter.

Since this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;) + &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;{C_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{C_2}&lt;/math&gt; gives 
&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;), and 
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; [1 - (&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}\hat{N_2})^2&lt;/math&gt; ] = &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;).

Define the “dihedral angle”, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_1}}&lt;/math&gt;·&lt;math&gt;{\hat{N_2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_1- d_2  \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; ,  and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(d_2- d_1 \cos\alpha)}{\sin^2 \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the intersection line we have &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;,  where &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;l_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;m_3&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;n_3&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;C_1l_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2l_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1m_1&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;C_2m_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_1n_1&lt;/math&gt; +&lt;math&gt;C_2n_2&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_i}&lt;/math&gt;=(&lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;), for i=1,2,3.

To find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2}+\frac{z^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, to get
&lt;math&gt;At^2 + 2Bt + C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;l_3^2 + m_3^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}n_3^2&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0l_3 + y_0m_3 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0n_3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 + y_0^2 + \frac{a^2}{b^2}z_0^2 - a^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the line intersects the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{{B}^2-AC}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 &lt; AC&lt;/math&gt;, then there is no intersection. If &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;, then the line is tangent to the earth at &lt;math&gt;t = -B/A&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).

Observe that &lt;math&gt;A\ne0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2}&lt;/math&gt;are not colinear.  Plugging t into
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; + t&lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.

=== Examples ===
==== Maximum or Minimum Latitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_3} = (m, -l, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then solve for &lt;math&gt;d_2 = z_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging t into &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_0 + t\hat{N_3}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm b^*\mathbf{\hat{j^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Maximum or Minimum Longitude ====
on a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_1} = (l, m, n)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d&lt;/math&gt;, and setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{N_2} = (-\sin\theta, \cos\theta, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the longitude to be solved for such that &lt;math&gt;B^2 = AC&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, just set &lt;math&gt;R = {R_c} \pm a^*\mathbf{\hat{i^*}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:''This article is about elective educational placements, for elective medical procedures see [[Elective surgery]]''.

An '''elective'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sometimes known by other names, such as a ''Subject to Endorsement Placement'' (StEP) at [[Manchester Medical School]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manchester&gt;{{cite web|title=Course description|url=http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/medicine/coursedetails/?code=01428&amp;pg=2|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a placement undertaken as part of a [[medical degree]]. The content and setting of the placement are largely decided by the student undertaking it,&lt;ref name=hospdoc&gt;{{cite web|last=Broad|first=Mike|title=Going on medical elective: a guide for students|url=http://www.hospitaldr.co.uk/guidance/going-on-medical-elective-a-guide-for-students|publisher=Hospital Dr|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some students choosing to spend it in a different country.

Elective placements are not exclusive to medical degrees; many other degree programmes within the field of healthcare also incorporate electives (such as [[nursing]], [[dentistry]] and [[physiotherapy]]) and the format is often the same.

==Motivations==

An elective represents a unique opportunity for [[medical students]] to experience [[healthcare]] in a setting unfamiliar to that in which they are accustomed to studying,&lt;ref name="manchester"/&gt; or in a place or field of specific interest. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medics Away elective page|url=http://www.medicsaway.co.uk/index.php/travel/electives/|publisher=Medics Away|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is classically in a low resource setting, but may also be to experience a specialist field, a place the student is considering working in the future, or for a variety of other reasons.

Placements abroad may provide experience of differing practices, but also allow students to encounter medical conditions they are less used to seeing at home.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, certain [[infectious diseases]] that are uncommon in the [[Western world]] but common elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, students often retrospectively describe how their placements broadened their horizons with regards to the social issues affecting healthcare in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordonweeks|first=Alex|title=India Elective, 2005|url=http://www.yoracle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=11&amp;mosmsg=Thanks+for+your+vote!|publisher=Yoracle|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A placement in a particular specialist setting may allow students insight into a potential career path, or allow students to participate in the research or implementation of new treatments or practices. 

==Structure and organisation==
An elective is usually undertaken in the penultimate or final year of study of a medical degree, often after students have finished their final exams.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt; The university usually specifies the dates during which an elective can be undertaken by students.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding your elective|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.d5851|publisher=Student BMJ|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electives are usually entirely self-arranged, with the student organising travel, accommodation, the placement itself, and other aspects like travel insurance and indemnity insurance. Often the hospital will help organise accommodation, and indemnity cover may be automatic depending on the student's existing policy. Some students recruit the services of companies which specialise in organising medical electives.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt; Students often share their experiences on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Electives Network|url=http://www.electives.net|publisher=TEN|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and good placements become well-known. Popular destinations can fill up 12 months in advance or more&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

===Cost===

Most students need to cover travel and living costs, many needing to cover accommodation, and some are charged administration or tuition costs, which can be up to $1,000 or more &lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/concord/electives/fees.php&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Many students fund their electives personally, but financial help is occasionally available in the forms of &lt;ref name="Work the World"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Work the World |title=How to get funds for your elective |url=http://www.worktheworld.co.uk/bursaries-and-grants|publisher=Work the World |accessdate=13 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bursaries, prizes or scholarships, either from the student's university or from societies or private companies. In these cases, the sponsor may require that the student undertakes some form of project whilst on their elective to justify the expense.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

==Requirements==
Requirements of students vary from medical school to medical school. Some (such as [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|Aberdeen]]) require students to submit a written project as part of their placement, whereas other institutions utilise few formal assessments.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;

Students are still subject to all the ethical and professional requirements they would be at their home institution, such as the [[General Medical Council|GMC]]'s requirement that students at British med schools "recognise and work within the limits of their competence".&lt;ref name=GMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Medical Practice: Duties of a doctor|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp|work=Good Medical Practice|publisher=General Medical Council|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is immoral and illegal for unregistered medical students to work as if doctors, despite the fact that their level of skill and expertise is often comparable to the professionals they will work with on the placement.&lt;ref name="hospdoc"/&gt;

'''Emanuel Tov''' ({{lang-he|עמנואל טוב}}; born September 15, 1941, Amsterdam, Netherlands) is [[emeritus Professor]] in the Department of [[Bible]] at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Emanuel Tov was born in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] during the German occupation (1941). When he was one year old his parents entrusted him to the care of a [[Christian]] family. His parents perished in the [[Holocaust]], and following the war he grew up with his uncle and aunt as one of their children. He studied at a “gymnasium”, where he learned classical and modern European languages, and at the same time learned [[Hebrew]] at [[Talmud Torah]]. From age 14, he was active in the [[Zionism|Zionistic]] youth movement “Ichud Habonim” and served as one of its leaders. At age 18, the movement sent him to [[Israel]] for training as a leader and in 1960 he became the general secretary of that movement in the Netherlands. In 1961, he immigrated to Israel. He studied at the Hebrew University ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] Bible; [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Bible and [[Greek literature]]), while serving also as an assistant in the Bible Dept. and at the Hebrew University Bible Project. In 1967-1969, he continued his studies at the Dept. for [[Near Eastern]] Studies and Languages at Harvard University. His dissertation, written under the guidance of Professors [[Shemaryahu Talmon]] of the Hebrew University and [[Frank Moore Cross]] of [[Harvard University]], was submitted to the Hebrew University in 1973 as “The [[Septuagint]] Translation of [[Jeremiah]] and [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]].” Upon his return to Israel, he served as an “assistant” at the [[University of Haifa]] and at the Hebrew University.

In 1986, he was appointed Professor at the Hebrew University and in 1990 he became the J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible Studies. Served as visiting Professor at the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]], [[Doshisha University|Doshisha]] (Kyoto), Macquarie and [[University of Sydney|Sydney]] (Australia), [[Stellenbosch University|Stellenbosch]] (South Africa), [[Vrije Universiteit]] (Amsterdam), [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Philadelphia), the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (Rome), and Halle (Germany). He stayed at Institutes for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study|NIAS]] (the Netherlands), Annenberg (Philadelphia), Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and the Lichtenberg Kolleg (Göttingen, Germany).

He was one of the editors of the [[Hebrew University Bible Project]]. He is a member of the editorial board of the journals ''Dead Sea Discoveries'' and the ''Journal of Jewish Studies'', and served on the Academic committee of the Magnes Press. He is the co-founder and chairman (1991–2000) of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, a Member of the Academic Committee of [[the Orion Center]] for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Senior Associate Fellow of the   and an Honorary Fellow of the [[Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies]].

the introductory volume: E. Tov (ed.), The Texts from the Judaean Desert: Indices and an Introduction to the Discoveries in the Judaean Desert Series (DJD XXXIX; Oxford: Clarendon, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also published an electronic edition of all the extra-biblical [[Qumran]] scrolls and a six-volume printed edition of the scrolls meant for the general public. 
&lt;ref&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls Reader, Parts 1-6  (Leiden/ Boston: E. J. Brill, 2004-2005; second revised edition, 2014). 
&lt;/ref&gt; He also created electronic
editions of the Hebrew and Greek Bible.&lt;ref&gt;See Tov's

==Research==

===Septuagint===

Emanuel Tov's studies on the Septuagint focused first on inner-translational developments and gradually moved to the importance of this translation for the study of the Bible: the early revisions of the Septuagint, translation technique, the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Greek translation, the value of the Septuagint for the textual study of the Hebrew Bible, the importance of certain Septuagint books for the exegesis of the Hebrew books and the understanding of their literary development, the place of the Hebrew source of the Septuagint in the development of the text of the Bible.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 3*, 7a*, 65, 181, 207 in [http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov Tov's bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728184807/http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov/ |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's initial publications on the Septuagint deal with that translation's early revisions that were intended to approximate the Greek text to the Hebrew text current in Israel from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE. For that research, he established sound principles by determining the criteria for defining and characterizing the revisions. His preoccupation with matters of translation technique and the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint was influenced by his practical work in the HUBP (Hebrew University Bible Project). In that research, he combined the field work in that project with the formulation of abstract rules for the evaluation of details in the Septuagint, constantly cross-fertilizing both areas. These rules were formulated in his theoretical book on the Septuagint that grew out of his courses at the Hebrew University, each year on a different Bible book
&lt;ref&gt;The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Third Edition, Completely Revised and Enlarged; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2015). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the focus of Tov's interest moved to the importance of the Septuagint for biblical scholarship, both for textual and literary criticism. In several books, the Septuagint reflects a Hebrew basis that needs to be taken into consideration in the exegesis of those books beyond small details, both when, according to Tov, the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint preceded the Masoretic Text (Joshua, 1 Samuel 16–18, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) and when it serves as an exegetical layer reacting to the forerunner of the Masoretic Text (1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel). According to Tov, in all these books the exegete of the Hebrew books must take the Greek translation into consideration. A precondition for this procedure is that the analysis of the translation technique as described in the previous paragraph will have established that the Septuagint is a good source for analyzing the text that lay in front of him. From among all the early witnesses of the biblical text, the best ones for analyzing the stages of its literary development are the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, a few Qumran texts and the Samaritan Pentateuch. Tov believes that the analysis of early witnesses such as the Septuagint enriches our exegesis and helps us in understanding the last stages of the development of the biblical literature in specific books.

===Development of the Bible text===

Emanuel Tov does not describe the development of the biblical text based on abstract theories, but tries to take the evidence of the ancient manuscripts and versions as his point of departure. It is clear that in antiquity many versions of the Bible were circulating, as is evident from the textual plurality at Qumran. All the manuscripts differed from one another, but within that plurality one may recognize some groups (families). Tov  qualified this plurality by providing  the internal statistics of the different types of the Qumran scrolls. He also described the socio-religious background of some groups of the Judean Desert scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;See items 171 and 178 in Tov's bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important link in this argumentation is the group of the so-called 4QReworked Pentateuch texts.  Ten years after Tov published this group of  documents
,&lt;ref&gt;Together with S. A. White: “4QReworked Pentateuchb–e and 4QTemple?“ in H. Attridge et al., in consultation with J. VanderKam, Qumran Cave 4.VIII, Parabiblical Texts, Part 1 (DJD XIII; Oxford:  
Clarendon, 1994) 187–351, 459–63 and plates XIII–XXXXVI&lt;/ref&gt;  he realized that these texts do not reflect a single non-biblical rewritten Pentateuch composition, but  a cluster of biblical texts that included many exegetical elements. These texts reflect a link in the series of developing biblical texts. 
&lt;ref&gt;See items 206a and 216 in Tovs bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's studies on the Septuagint and 4QReworked Pentateuch led him to new thoughts regarding the development of the last stages of the biblical books and the original text of these books. In his view, the early stages of the biblical books such as reflected in the Septuagint of 1 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, show that the formulations of these books developed stage by stage. This reconstructed development makes it difficult to posit an original text of the biblical books. In Tov's view, there was not one original text, but a series of “original texts.” This view developed after the appearance of the second edition of his  Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2001) and was emphasized more in
the third edition (2012).
&lt;ref&gt;See “The Many Forms of Scripture: Reflections in Light of the LXX and 4QReworked Pentateuch,” in From Qumran to Aleppo: A Discussion with Emanuel Tov about the Textual History of Jewish Scriptures in Honor of his 65th Birthday (ed. A. Lange et al.; FRLANT 230; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2009) 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the text of the Torah===
In studies primarily carried out in the 2010s, Tov focused on the
special textual status of the Torah.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 210, 224,
244, 260, 261, 264, 283, 290 in the bibliography in the website&lt;/ref&gt;
In his view, the textual development of the Torah differed from that
of all other Scripture books, probably because of its popularity.
The Masoretic Text reflects the presumed original text better than
all other preserved texts, all of which reflect more secondary
elements than MT, especially the one-time joined tradition of the
Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX. Further, the number of the 
non-Masoretic textual branches in the Torah is much larger than in
all other Scripture books.

===Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran scribes===

Emanuel Tov dealt with various aspects of the Qumran scrolls, but his most central publications pertain to the Qumran scribes. In 2004, he published a detailed monograph on the scribal practices reflected in the Qumran scrolls,   suggesting that the information about these scribal practices allows us to obtain a better understanding of the Qumran scrolls. 
&lt;ref&gt;Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the Judean Desert (STDJ 54; Leiden/Boston: E. J. Brill, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
This monograph describes the technical aspects of all the Judean Desert texts, such as the measurements of the columns and sheets, the beginnings and ends of scrolls, systems of correcting mistakes, orthography systems, and a classification of the scrolls according to these parameters.

An important part of this description is Tov's theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the margins guiding the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov's suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities.
&lt;ref&gt;For the latest formulation of this view, see item 13 in list 4 below, "Books Authored" (Scribal Practices)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-assisted research of the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls===

Emanuel Tov believes that the examination of the Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls needs to be aided by computer-assisted research and that therefore databases and computer programs need to be developed. He supervised the electronic encoding of the Leningrad Codex in the 1980s.
&lt;ref&gt;This encoding was published among others in: JPS Hebrew–English Tanakh: The Traditional Hebrew Text and the New JPS Translation (2d. ed.; Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, he also embarked upon a research project together with Prof. Robert A. Kraft of the University of Pennsylvania (CATSS = Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies). That project, based in Philadelphia and Jerusalem, created a comparative database of all the words in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. It was published as a module within the Accordance program (subsequently also within Bible Works and Logos). With the aid of that program, which allows for advanced searches and statistical research, several such investigations have been carried out by Tov and others.
&lt;ref&gt;
For a listing, see Tov's website under bibliography, CATSS
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another database edited by Tov contains all the texts and images of the para-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, in the original languages and in translation, with morphological analysis and search programs.  All these programs serve the international community.

[[File:Cameo prince Louvre MR54.jpg|thumb|[[Cameo (carving)|Cameo]] of a Roman prince]]
An '''engraved gem''', frequently referred to as an '''intaglio''', is a small and usually [[semi-precious]] [[gemstone]] that has been carved, in the Western tradition normally with images or inscriptions only on one face.&lt;ref&gt;Fully half of the antique engraved gems in the [[Berlin museums]] and the [[British Museum]] are either [[sard]] or [[carnelian]], Etta M. Saunders, noted. Saunders, "Goddess Riding a Goat-Bull Monster: A Ceres Zodiac Gem from the Walters Art Gallery" ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''49/50''' (1991/1992;7-11) note 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[engraving]] of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world,]] and an important one in some later periods.&lt;ref&gt;The three preeminent European collections of post-Classical engraved gems are the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris, the Habsburg collection, Vienna, and the [[British Museum]], London, [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]] observed in "Mediæval and Later Engraved Gems in the British Museum — I" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''23''' No. 123 (June 1913:128-136) and "II" ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''24''' No. 127 (October 1913:28-32).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, ''engraving'' means carving ''in intaglio'' (with the design cut ''into'' the flat background of the stone), but [[relief]] carvings (with the design projecting ''out of'' the background as in nearly all [[cameo (carving)|cameos]]) are also covered by the term. This article uses ''cameo'' in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called ''gem carving'' and the artists ''gem-cutters''. References to antique gems and intaglios in a [[jewellery]] context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to [[monumental sculpture]], [[counter-relief]], meaning the same as ''intaglio'', is more likely to be used. Vessels like the [[Cup of the Ptolemies]] and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as ''[[hardstone carving]]s''.

'''Glyptics''' or ''glyptic art'' covers the field of small carved stones, including [[cylinder seal]]s and inscriptions, especially in an archaeological context. Though they were keenly collected in antiquity, most carved gems originally functioned as [[seal (insignia)|seals]], often mounted in a ring; intaglio designs register most clearly when viewed by the recipient of a letter as an impression in hardened wax. A finely carved seal was practical, as it made forgery more difficult – the distinctive personal [[signature]] did not really exist in antiquity.

==Technique==
Gems were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a [[lathe]]. [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] has been mined for abrasive powder on [[Naxos island|Naxos]] since antiquity. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 8-16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bWo5T2JdVUC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Engraved+gem&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Engraved%20gem&amp;f=false quotes passages] from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, "Gemstone enhancement"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cylinder seal antelope Louvre AM1639.jpg|thumb|Antelopes attacked by birds: [[cylinder seal]] in [[hematite]] and its impression. Late Bronze Age II (maybe 14th century BC), from [[Cyprus]] in the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period, following Near Eastern precedents.]]
The technique has an ancient tradition in the [[Near East]], and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. The [[cylinder seal]], whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] and other cultures, and spread to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan world]], including parts of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. The Greek tradition emerged in [[Ancient Greek art]] under Minoan influence on mainland [[Helladic]] culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the [[Hellenistic period]]. Pre-[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenic]] [[Ancient Egypt]]ian seals tend to have inscriptions in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] rather than images. The Biblical [[Book of Exodus]] describes the form of the [[hoshen]], a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the [[Twelve tribes of Israel]].

Round or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 39 See Beazley for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval,&lt;ref&gt;"Lenticular" or "lentoid" gems have the form of a [[lens (geometry)|lens]].&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] back (in the past this type was called a "scarabaeus"), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Later Archaic Greek gems: introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2-3 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by [[Dexamenos]] of [[Chios]] are the finest of the period, two showing [[heron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scarab satyr BM Gem 465.jpg|thumb|Reclining [[satyr]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] c. 550 BC, 2.2 cm wide. Note the vase shown "sideways"; it is characteristic of early gems that not all elements in the design are read from the same direction of view.]]

Relief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the [[Sassanian]] and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as [[jewellery]] [[pendant]]s in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.

The cameo, which is rare in intaglio form, seems to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the [[Farnese Tazza]] is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the date assigned to the [[Gonzaga Cameo]] – see below), but other [[Glass casting|glass-paste]] imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 187-188&lt;/ref&gt; The conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley,
"Hellenistic gems: introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Roman gems generally continued [[Hellenistic]] styles, and can be hard to date, until their quality sharply declines at the end of the 2nd century AD. Philosophers are sometimes shown; [[Cicero]] refers to people having portraits of their favourite on their cups and rings.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans invented [[cameo glass]], best known from the [[Portland Vase]], as a cheaper material for cameos, and one that allowed consistent and predictable layers on even round objects.
[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|There are several antique and medieval engraved gems on the [[Ottonian]] [[Cross of Lothair]] (base later). Many antique engraved gems survived in such contexts]]

During the European [[Middle Ages]] antique engraved gems were one classical art form which was always highly valued, and a large but unknown number of ancient gems have (unlike most surviving classical works of art) never been buried and then excavated. Gems were used to decorate elaborate pieces of goldsmith work such as [[votive crown]]s, book-covers and crosses, sometimes very inappropriately given their subject matter. [[Matthew Paris]] illustrated a number of gems owned by [[St Albans Abbey]], including one large Late Roman imperial [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] (now lost) called ''Kaadmau'' which was used to induce overdue childbirths – it was slowly lowered, with a prayer to St Alban, on its chain down the woman's cleavage, as it was believed that the infant would flee downwards to escape it,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; a belief in accordance with the views of the "father of mineralogy", [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494–1555) on [[jasper]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qNOB-vcob88C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=poison+gemstone&amp;ei=Xqm6SvHiA4XgywSgscnvDg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false De Natura fossilium Bk 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Some gems were engraved, mostly with religious scenes in intaglio, during the period both in [[Byzantium]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Examples: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_40.20.59.htm 14th century French Crucifixion], [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bnpr/ho_1975.1.1522.htm Rosary pendant, 15th century], both onyx and in the MMA New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West production revived from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]], when [[rock crystal]] was the commonest material. The [[Lothair Crystal]] (or ''Suzanna Crystal'', [[British Museum]], 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), clearly not designed for use as a seal, is the best known of 20 surviving Carolingian large intaglio gems with complex figural scenes, although most were used for seals.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_lothar,_or_susanna_crystal.aspx Susanna Crystal], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Several crystals were designed, like the ''Susanna Crystal'', to be viewed through the gem from the unengraved side, so their inscriptions were reversed like the seals. In wills and inventories, engraved gems were often given pride of place at the head of a list of treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, 1, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gems in a remarkably effective evocation of classical style were made in [[Southern Italy]] for the court of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the first half of the 13th century, several in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]] in Paris. Meanwhile, the church led the development of large, often double-sided, metal seal matrices for wax seals that were left permanently attached to [[charter]]s and similar legal documents, dangling by a cord, though smaller ring seals that were broken when a letter was opened remained in use. It is not clear to what extent this also continued practices in the ancient world.

==Renaissance revival==
[[File:Nicolo intaglio warriors CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warrior]] supporting dying comrade. 1st century BC or AD.]]
The late medieval French and Burgundian courts collected and commissioned gems, and began to use them for portraits. The British Museum has what is probably a seated portrait of [[John, Duke of Berry]] in intaglio on a [[sapphire]], and the Hermitage has a cameo head of [[Charles VII of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 411&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest had also revived in [[Early Renaissance]] Italy, where [[Venice]] soon became a particular centre of production. Along with the Roman statues and [[sarcophagi]] being newly excavated, antique gems were prime sources for artists eager to regain a classical figurative vocabulary. Cast bronze copies of gems were made, which circulated around Italy, and later Europe.&lt;ref name=draper&gt;Draper, James David. "Cameo Appearances". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/hd_came.htm (August 2008)]
&lt;/ref&gt; Among very many examples of borrowings that can be traced confidently, the ''Felix'' or ''Diomedes'' gem owned by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]] (see below), with an unusual pose, was copied by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and may well have provided the "starting point" for one of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''ignudi'' on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].&lt;ref&gt;Claire [[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]] in J.

By the 16th century carved and engraved gems were keenly collected across Europe for dedicated sections of a [[cabinet of curiosities]], and their production revived, in classical styles; 16th-century gem-cutters working with the same types of [[sardonyx]] and other hardstones and using virtually the same techniques, produced classicizing works of glyptic art, often intended as forgeries, in such quantity that they compromised the market for them, as [[Gisela Richter]] observed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Nowadays, however, they have been somewhat neglected—probably because a genuine gem is difficult to distinguish from forged one, and collectors have grown timid in consequence" (Richter, "Engraved Gems" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', '''17'''.9 (September 1922:193-196) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--(Can any editor retrieve the article that discusses this?) Forgeries of Minoan engraved hardstone seals designed to draw the generation of [[Sir Arthur Evans]] complicate the study of the genuine ones.--&gt; Even today, Sir [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]] admits that "We are sometimes at a loss to know whether what we are looking at belongs to the 1st or the 15th century AD, a sad confession for any art-historian."&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Renaissance gems reveal their date by showing mythological scenes derived from literature that were not part of the visual repertoire in classical times, or borrowing compositions from Renaissance paintings, and using "compositions with rather more figures than any ancient engraver would have tolerated or attempted".&lt;ref name="Boardman lecture"/&gt; Among artists, the wealthy [[Rubens]] was a notable collector.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Collectors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel traditions==
Engraved gems occur in the [[Bible]], especially when the [[hoshen]] and [[ephod]] worn by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] are described; though these were inscribed with the names of the [[tribes of Israel]] in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive, "Late Antique, Early Christian and Jewish gems: Sasanian gems – Christian and Jewish"&lt;/ref&gt; Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the [[Koran]], and sometimes gems in the Western tradition just contain inscriptions.

Many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures have their own traditions, although for example the important Chinese tradition of carved gemstones and hardstones, especially [[Chinese jade|jade carving]], is broader than the European one of concentration on a flattish faced stone that might fit into a ring. [[Seal engraving (art)|Seal engraving]] covers the inscription that is printed by stamping, which nearly always only contains script rather than images. [[Seal sculpture (art)|Other decoration]] of the seal itself was not intended to be reproduced.

==Iconography==
[[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna June 2006 031.jpg|thumb|the [[Gemma Augustea]] cameo, in two layered [[onyx]]; 19 × 23 cm.]]
The iconography of gems is similar to that of coins, though more varied. Early gems mostly show animals. Gods, [[satyr]]s, and mythological scenes were common, and famous statues often represented – much modern knowledge of the poses of lost Greek cult statues such as [[Athena Promachos]] comes from the study of gems, which often have clearer images than coins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Numismatic]] evidence is the other most indicative evidence of the general pose of locally important [[cult image]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th(?) century BC Greek gem already shows [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] committing suicide, with his name inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/styles/geometric/island.htm Geometric and Early Archaic gems: Island gems] 6th down.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Heracles]] was, as in other arts, the most common source of narrative subjects. A scene may be intended as the subject of an [[Archaic Greece|early Archaic]] gem, and certainly appears on 6th century examples from the later Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Archaic period pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraits of monarchs are found from the Hellenistic period onwards, although as they do not usually have identifying inscriptions, many fine ones cannot be identified with a subject. In the Roman Imperial period, portraits of the imperial family were often produced for the court circle, and many of these have survived, especially a number of spectacular cameos from the time of [[Augustus]]. As private objects, produced no doubt by artists trained in the tradition of Hellenistic monarchies, their iconography is less inhibited than the public state art of the period about showing divine attributes as well as sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 154-5. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/c/cameo_portrait_of_augustus.aspx British Museum] on the [[Blacas Cameo]] of Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The identity and interpretation of figures in the [[Gemma Augustea]] remains unclear. A number of gems from the same period contain scenes apparently from the lost epic on the [[Iliou persis|Sack of Troy]], of which the finest is by Dioskurides ([[Chatsworth House]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 153, Boardman, 275-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance and later gems remain dominated by the Hellenistic repertoire of subjects, though portraits in contemporary styles were also produced.

==Collectors==
[[File:Coupe des Ptolémées 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Coupe des Ptolémées]] ([[Cabinet des Médailles]], Paris)]]

Famous collectors begin with King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] (d. 63 BC), whose collection was part of the booty of [[Pompey the Great]], who donated it to the Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, see below. Whether he was right to claim Mithridates as the first collector is dubious.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] was determined to excel Pompey in this as in other areas, and later gave six collections to his own [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]]; according to [[Suetonius]] gems were among his varied collecting passions.&lt;ref&gt;''De Vita Caesarum, Divus Iulius'', (The Lives of the Caesars, The Deified Julius), [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html Fordham online text]&lt;/ref&gt; Many later emperors also collected gems. Chapters 4-6 of Book 37 of the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] give a summary art history of the Greek and Roman tradition, and of Roman collecting. According to Pliny [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)]] was the first Roman collector.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'', xxxvii.5&lt;/ref&gt;

As in later periods objects carved in the round from semi-precious stone were regarded as a similar category of object; these are also known as [[hardstone carving]]s.  One of the largest, the ''[[Coupe des Ptolémées]]'' was probably donated to the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, by [[Charles the Bald]], as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to [[Charlemagne]]. One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from [[Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]], and is in the Treasury of the [[Basilica of San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities-interactive.org/medieval/sanmarco/ Treasury of San Marco]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Coupe des Ptolémées'', most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the value of the materials, as happened to many in the [[French Revolution]].
[[File:Cameo gonzaga.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Gonzaga Cameo]], carved of Indian [[sardonyx]] ([[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]) The gem measures 15.7 × 11.8 cm.]]

The collection of 827 engraved gems of [[Pope Paul II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html Getty Collectors, under Pietro Barbó]&lt;/ref&gt; which included the "Felix gem" of [[Diomedes]] with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]],&lt;ref&gt;It passed into the [[Arundel marbles|Arundel collection]] and came to Oxford: see [http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objectofmonth/2004-10/history.htm Ashmolean image and description] and Graham Pollard, "The Felix Gem at Oxford and its provenance" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''119''' No. 893 (August 1977:574).&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]]; the [[Medici]] collection included many other gems and was legendary, valued in inventories much higher than his [[Botticelli]]s. Somewhat like Chinese collectors, Lorenzo had all his gems inscribed with his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521452458&amp;ss=exc Online: The ''Introduction'' from ''Lorenzo de'Medici, Collector of Antiquities{{'}}'', by Laurie Fusco &amp; Gino Corti, Cambridge UP 2006, which gives a survey of early Renaissance collecting in general. On his signing his gems see Draper]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gonzaga Cameo]] passed through a series of famous collections before coming to rest in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. First known in the collection of [[Isabella d'Este]], it passed to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Dukes of Mantua]], [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], Cardinal [[Decio Azzolini]], [[Livio Odescalchi]], Duke of [[Bracciano]], and Pope [[Pius VI]] before [[Napoleon]] carried it off to Paris, where his [[Empress Joséphine]] gave it to [[Alexander I of Russia]] after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/art-exhibitions-Italy.asp Gonzaga Cameo] Exhibition in Mantua [http://ancientrome.ru/art/artworken/img.htm?id=882 further details]&lt;/ref&gt; It remains disputed whether the cameo is [[Alexandria]]n work of the 3rd century BC, or a [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] imitation of the style from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cammeogonzaga.it/eng/Gonzaga-cameo-hermitage.asp Mantua exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the largest cameo gems from antiquity were created for members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] and seem to have survived above ground since antiquity. The large [[Gemma Augustea]] appeared in 1246 in the treasury of the [[Basilique St-Sernin, Toulouse]]. In 1533, [[Francis I of France|King François I]] appropriated it and moved it to Paris, where it soon disappeared around 1590. Not long thereafter it was fenced for 12,000 gold pieces to Emperor Rudolph II; it remains in [[Vienna]], alongside the [[Gemma Claudia]]. The largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity is the [[Great Cameo of France]], which entered (or re-entered) the French royal collection in 1791 from the treasury of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], where it had been since at least 1291.

In England, a false dawn of gem collecting was represented by [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]]' purchase of the cabinet of the Flemish antiquary [[Abraham Gorlaeus]] in 1609,&lt;ref&gt;Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance'' (1986:199).&lt;/ref&gt; and engraved gems featured among the antiquities assembled by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]]. Later in the century [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], formed a collection of gems that is still conserved at [[Chatsworth, Derbyshire|Chatsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Scarisbrick, "The Devonshire Parure", ''Archaeologia'' '''108''' (1986:241).&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century a more discerning cabinet of gems was assembled by [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]], acting upon the advice of Francesco Maria Zanetti and [[Francesco Ficoroni]]; 170 of the Carlisle gems, both Classical and post-Classical, were purchased in 1890 for the [[British Museum]].

By the mid-eighteenth century prices had reached such a level that major collections could only be formed by the very wealthy; lesser collectors had to make do with collecting [[plaster cast]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"Sulphurs" provided even finer detail; [[James Tassie]] made a career of casting gems in plaster and in coloured opaque glass.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also very popular, or buying one of many sumptuously illustrated catalogues of collections that were published.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from those mentioned below, there is information on other notable collections [http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/gems/collectors.html from the Getty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine the Great]]'s collection is in the [[Hermitage Museum]]; one large collection she had bought was the gems from the [[Orléans Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/04/b2003/hm4_1_i.html Hermitage Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis XV of France]] hired [[Dominique Vivant]] to assemble a collection for [[Madame de Pompadour]].

[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 068.jpg|thumb|Casts ("pastes") of gems in collector's cabinets]]
In the eighteenth century British aristocrats were able to outcompete even the agents for royal and princely collectors on the Continent, aided by connoisseur-dealers like Count [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]] and [[Philipp von Stosch]]. Zanetti travelled Europe in pursuit of gems hidden in private collections for the British aristocrats he tutored in connoisseurship;&lt;ref&gt;His correspondence with [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] is published by Diana Scarisbrick, "Gem Connoisseurship – The 4th Earl of Carlisle's Correspondence with Francesco de Ficoroni and Antonion Maria Zanetti", ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''129'''No. 1007 (February 1987:90-104).&lt;/ref&gt; his own collection was described in [[Antonio Francesco Gori|A.F. Gori]], ''Le gemme antiche di Anton Maria Zanetti'' (Venice, 1750), illustrated with eighty plates of engravings from his own drawings. Baron [[Philipp von Stosch]] (1691–1757), a Prussian who lived in Rome and then Florence, was a major collector, as well as a dealer in engraved gems: "busy, unscrupulous, and in his spare time a spy for England in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, Boardman Lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contemporaries, Stosch made his lasting impression with ''Gemmæ Antiquæ Cælatæ'' (''Pierres antiques graveés'') (1724), in which [[Bernard Picart]]'s engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections. He also encouraged [[Johann Lorenz Natter]] (1705–1763) whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence. [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] bought Stosch's collection in 1765 and built the [[Antique Temple]] in the park of the [[Sanssouci Palace]] to house his collections of ancient sculpture, coins and over 4,000 gems – the two were naturally often grouped together. The gems are now in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].

The collection of [[Joseph Smith (1682–1770)|Joseph Smith]], British [[consul]] in [[Venice]] was bought by [[George III of England]] and remains in the [[Royal Collection]]. The collections of [[Charles Towneley]], [[Richard Payne Knight]] and [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] were bought by or bequeathed to the [[British Museum]], founding their very important collection.&lt;ref&gt;Towneley's were bought from his heirs, the others bequeathed. See King, 218-225 for a selection of highlights&lt;/ref&gt; But the most famous English collection was that formed by the [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke of Marlborough]] (1739–1817), "which the Duke kept in his bedroom and resorted to as a relief from his ambitious wife, his busy sister and his many children".&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/marlborough/default.htm Marlborough Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; This included collections formerly owned by the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s of [[Mantua]] (later owned by Lord Arundel), [[William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough|the 2nd Earl of Bessborough]], and the brother of [[Lord Chesterfield]], who himself warned his son in one of his ''Letters'' against "days lost in poring upon imperceptible intaglios and cameos".&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"&gt;Beazley, ''The Marlborough Gems'', [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/lectures/boardman.htm Boardman Lecture].&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, including its single most famous cameo, ''the'' "[[Marlborough gem]]" depicting an initiation of Cupid and Psyche, was dispersed after a sale in 1899, fortunately timed for the new American museums and provided the core of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan]] in New York and elsewhere,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; with the largest group still together being about 100 in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref name="beazley.ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

Prince [[Stanisław Poniatowski (1754-1833)|Stanisław Poniatowski]] (1754–1833) "commissioned about 2500 gems and encouraged the belief that they were, in fact, ancient." He presented a set of 419 plaster impressions of his collection to the King of [[Prussia]] which now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in [[Berlin]], where they were recognised as modern in 1832, mainly because the signatures of ancient artists from very different times were found on gems in too consistent a style.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/poniatowski/default.htm The Poniatowski Collection of gems].

==Artists==
[[File:The Punishment of Tityus, a rock crystal intaglio by Giovanni Bernardi, the British Museum.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of [[Tityos|Tityus]]'', a rock crystal intaglio by [[Giovanni Bernardi]].]]
As in other fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from literary sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, [[Pyrgoteles]] was the only artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of [[Alexander the Great]]. Most of the most famous Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching [[signet ring]]s of [[Augustus]] – very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also a gem engraver.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 275-6. Hennig 153-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anichini family]] were leading artists in Venice and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries. Many Renaissance artists no doubt kept their activities quiet, as they were passing their products off as antique. Other specialist carvers included [[Giovanni Bernardi]] (1494–1553), [[Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio]] (c. 1500–1565), [[Giuseppe Antonio Torricelli]] (1662–1719), the German-Italian [[Anton Pichler]] (1697–1779) and his sons [[Giovanni Pichler|Giovanni]] and [[Luigi Pichler|Luigi]], [[Charles Christian Reisen]] (Anglo-Norwegian, 1680–1725). Other sculptors also carved gems, or had someone in their workshop who did. [[Leone Leoni]] said he personally spent two months on a double-sided cameo gem with portraits of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/came/ho_38.150.9.htm Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scot [[James Tassie]] (1735–1799), and his nephew [[William Tassie|William]] (1777–1860) developed methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, and also for casting new designs from carved wax in [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions ("Tassie gems") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier version is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-kHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=A+Catalogue,+Of+Impressions+In+Sulphur:+Of+Antique+And+Modern+Gems+From+Which+Pastes+Are+Made+And+Sold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ltoEkw81eM&amp;sig=iuByBRDFZjRcKrKd8bFMUezGgiE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l7SvSoO6N4af4gahtcTzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] ''A Catalogue, Of Impressions In Sulphur: Of Antique And Modern Gems From Which Pastes Are Made And Sold'' (1775) ({{ISBN|110459093X}} / 1-104-59093-X)&lt;/ref&gt; There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London, and in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Beazley, [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/gems/tassie/default.htm Tassie]&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' [[brooch]]es, such as [[ceramic art|ceramic]] cameos by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in [[jasperware]]. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s,&lt;ref name=draper/&gt; perhaps partly as a growing realization of the number of gems that were not what they seemed to be scared collectors. Among the last practitioners was [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], who sensibly moved into the new art of [[photography]]. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist [[Ronald Pennell]],&lt;ref&gt;Significant Figures in Art &amp; Craft Today, Derek Reay, MoTi publishing, UK 2011&lt;/ref&gt; whose work is held in the British [[Crafts Council]] Collection among many others.

==Imitations==
[[File:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n4.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Portland Vase]] in Roman [[cameo glass]] in imitation of [[onyx]].]]
[[Cameo glass]] was invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate engraved hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels – impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, mostly famously the [[Portland Vase]], are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Trentinella, Rosemarie.

The Middle Ages, which lived by [[charter]]s and other sealed documents, were at least as keen on using seals as the ancient world, now creating them for towns and church institutions, but they normally used metal matrices and [[signet ring]]s. However some objects, like a 13th-century Venetian ''[[Seven Sleepers of Ephesus]]'', mimicked the engraved gem.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Britishmuseumsevensleeperscameo.jpg|picture and link]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another offshoot of the mania for engraved gems is the fine-grained slightly translucent [[stoneware]] called [[jasperware]] that was developed by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and perfected in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Reilly, ''Wedgwood Jasper'' London, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Though white-on-blue matte jasperware is the most familiar Wedgwood ceramic line, still in production today and widely imitated since the mid-19th century, white-on-black was also produced. Wedgwood made notable jasperware copies of the Portland Vase and the ''Marlborough gem'', a famous head of [[Antinous]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antinoos.info/antin9a.htm Antinoos.info] See "Gems" section for gem and casts etc&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted in jasperware casts from antique gems by James Tassie. [[John Flaxman]]'s [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] designs for jasperware were carried out in the extremely low relief typical of cameo production. Some other [[porcelain]] imitated three-layer cameos purely by paint, even in implausible objects like a flat [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] tea-tray of 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/royal_porcelain/view_1.asp?item=0 Sèvres tea-tray from the Metropolitan museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars==
Gems were a favourite topic for [[antiquaries]] from the Renaissance onwards, culminating in the work of Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made in the work of [[Adolf Furtwängler]] (1853–1907, father of [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|the conductor, Wilhelm]]). Among recent scholars [[John Boardman (art historian)|Sir John Boardman]] (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems. [[Gertrud Seidmann]] (1919–2013) moved into the subject, having previously been a German teacher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13109">In [[forensic entomology]], '''entomotoxicology''' is the analysis of toxins in [[arthropod]]s (mainly [[flies]] and [[beetles]]) that feed on [[carrion]].  Using arthropods in a corpse or at a crime scene, investigators can determine whether toxins were present in a body at the time of death. This technique is a major advance in forensics; previously, such determinations were impossible in the case of severely decomposed bodies devoid of intoxicated tissue and bodily fluids. Ongoing research into the effects of toxins on arthropod development has also allowed better estimations of [[postmortem intervals]].

==Effects of toxins on arthropods==

Drugs can have a variety of effects on development rates of arthropods. [[Morphine]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] are commonly involved in cases where forensic entomology is used. The stages of growth for insects provides a basis for determining a cause in altered cycles in a specific species. An altered stage in development can often indicate toxins in the [[carrion]] on which the insects are feeding. Beetles (Order: [[Coleoptera]]) and beetle feces are often used in entomotoxicology, but the presence of toxins is often the result of the beetles’ feeding on fly larvae that have been feeding on the carrion containing toxic substances. Flies (Order: [[Diptera]]) are the most commonly used insect in entomotoxicology.&lt;ref name=gagliano&gt; Gagliano-Candela, R. and Aventaggiato, L. “The detection of toxic substances in entomological specimens.” ''International Journal of Legal Medicine'' 114 (2001): 197-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the study of ''Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis'' larvae, [[barbiturates]] were found to increase the length of the larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase in the time it takes to reach the stage of [[pupation]].&lt;ref name=musvasva&gt;Musvasva, E. and others. “Preliminary observations of the effects of hydrocortisone and sodium methohexital on development of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis Macquart (Diptera: [[Sarcophagidae]]), and implications for estimating post mortem interval.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna&gt;Introna, Francesco and others. ”Entomotoxicology.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, Lucila M.L.; Linhares, Arício X.; and Trigo, José Roberto. “Determination of drug levels and effect of diazepam on the growth of necrophagous flies of forensic importance in southeastern Brazil.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 140-144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'' (Diptera: [[Calliphoridae]]), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults.&lt;ref&gt; Bourel, Benoit and others. “Morphine extraction in necrophagous insects remains for determining ante-mortem opiate intoxication.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 127-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Some effects depend on the concentration of the toxin while others simply depend on its presence. For example, cocaine (at the lethal dose) causes larvae to “develop more rapidly 36 (to 76) hours after hatching”.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt; The amount of growth depends on the concentration of cocaine in the area being fed upon.  The amount of methamphetamine, on the other hand, affects the rate of pupal development. A lethal dose of methamphetamine increases larval development through approximately the first two days and afterwards the rate drops if exposure remains at the median lethal dosage. The presence of methamphetamine was also found to cause a decrease in the maximum length of the larvae.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Along with changes in development rates, extended periods of insect feeding refrain and variation in the size of the insect during any stage of development, can also indicate the presence of toxic substances in the insect’s food source.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

==Examples of use==

Since J.C. Beyer and his partners first demonstrated the ability of toxins to be recovered from [[maggots]] feeding on human remains in 1980, the use of entomotoxicology in investigations has made an emergence into the field of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name=pounder&gt;Pounder, Derrick J. “Forensic entomo-toxicology.” ''Journal of the Forensic Science Society'' 31 (1991): 469-472.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of one such case involved the discovery of a 22-year-old female with a history of suicide attempts found 14 days after her death.  Due to the body’s advanced stage of [[decomposition]], no organ or tissue samples were viable to screen for toxins. Through [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and [[thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC) analysis of ''Cochliomyia macellaria'' (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae found feeding on the woman’s body, [[phenobarbital]] was detected and perceived to have been in the woman’s system upon death.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Drug abuse detected===
In France, Pascal Kintz and his colleagues were able to demonstrate the use of entomotoxicology to detect toxins that were not discovered during the analysis of body tissues and fluids of a body found roughly two months after death.  A liquid chromatography analysis on organ tissue and Calliphoridae larvae found at the scene revealed the existence of five prescription medications.  [[Triazolam]], however, was only detected in the analysis of maggots and not in organ tissue samples.  Comparative research showed increased sensitivity of toxicological analysis of Diptera samples over decomposed body tissues.  A similar case involved the discovery of the remains of a 29-year-old known to abuse drugs, last seen alive five months prior.  Through the use of GC and GC-MS techniques, Nolte and his partners discovered the presence of cocaine in decomposed muscle tissue and in maggots found on the body.  However, due to the severity of decomposition of the muscle tissue, more suitable drug samples (devoid of decomposition byproducts) were reared from the maggots.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Aid determination of origin===
Pekka Nuorteva presented the case of a young woman found severely decomposed in Inkoo, Finland.  Diptera larvae recovered from the body were reared to adulthood and found to contain low levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], indicating that the woman came from an area of comparatively low mercury pollution.  This assumption was proven correct once the woman was identified and found to have been a student in Turku, Finland.  This case demonstrated the ability of toxicological analysis to help determine origin.&lt;ref name=goff-lord&gt; Goff, M. Lee and Lord, Wayne D. “Entomotoxicology- A New Area for Forensic Investigation.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 15 (1994): 51-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case applied Nuorteva’s research involving mercury and its effect on maggots.  Through experimentation, it was determined that maggots (fed on [[fish]] containing mercury) possessed levels of mercury in their tissue of even greater concentration than in the tissue of the fish.  Nuorteva also discovered that the presence of mercury in the maggots systems hindered their ability to enter into the pupal stage.&lt;ref name=goff&gt;Goff, M. Lee. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxin confounding of postmortem interval estimate===
Through the analysis of specific cases, it was revealed that toxins present in a person’s body upon death can confound [[postmortem interval]] estimations.  An example of such a case, reported by Gunatilake and Goff, concerned the discovery of a 58-year-old male with a history of attempted suicides found dead in a crawl space in Honolulu, Hawaii last seen eight days prior.  Two species of Diptera (Calliphoridae), ''Chrysomya megacephala'' and ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'', found on the corpse and tissue samples from the body revealed [[malathion]].  Investigators found it abnormal that, given the conditions, there were only two fly species found on the body and that these species revealed a postmortem interval of five days.  Thus it was determined that the presence of the [[organophosphate]] malathion in the man’s system delayed oviposition for a few days.&lt;ref name=goff-lord/&gt;

Paul Catts analyzed a case in Spokane, Washington where maggots rendered differing postmortem estimations.  A 20-year-old female victim was found stabbed to death and laying in an open environment surrounded by trees.  Most of the oldest maggots found on the body were approximately 6–7 mm long which suggested that they were roughly seven days old.  There was, however, a very strange exception which was the retrieval of a 17.7 mm maggot which suggested an age of 3 weeks.  After ruling out the possibility that the maggot had traveled onto the corpse from carrion nearby, it was assumed that there was no conceivable way a 3 week old maggot could have been present on the corpse.  Later investigations revealed that the woman had snorted cocaine shortly before her death and that the 17.7 mm maggot must have feed in the woman’s nasal cavity.  Research revealed that maggot development can be sped up by the ingestion of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt; Catts, E. Paul, and Neal H. Haskell. Entomology and Death: A Procedural Guide. Clemson: Joyce’s Print Shop, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Use of shed casings and insect feces===
Not only are tissues from maggots used to detect toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and identify toxins present in corpses upon death.  An instance of this finding was demonstrated by Edward McDonough, a [[medical examiner]] in Connecticut.  A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home.  Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: [[ampicillin]], [[Ceclor]], doxycyline, [[erythromycin]], [[Elavil]], [[Lomotil]], [[pentazocine]], and [[Tylenol 3]].   McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of [[amitriptyline]] and [[nortriptyline]].  Insect feces, shed pupal cases of ''[[Megaselia scalaris]]'' (Diptera: [[Phoridae]]), and shed larval skins of ''Dermestes maculates'' (Coleoptera: [[Dermestidae]]) were gathered from the corpse at the scene.  McDonough sent these to an [[FBI]] lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis.  The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline.  Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues.  The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies.  The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after [[death]].&lt;ref name=goff/&gt;

==Limitations==

Further research should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as [[bioaccumulation]], insect [[metabolism]] of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have only begun to be researched. Because it is a relatively new branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue.&lt;ref name=pounder/&gt; Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One reason for this is that a drug can only be detected in larvae when the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Z.; Hubbard, S.; Pounder, D.J. “Drug analysis in fly larvae.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 14 (1993): 118-120.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated this theory using ''[[Calliphora vicina]]'' larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of [[co-proxamol]] and [[amitriptyline]] overdose. Samples of pupae and third [[instar]] larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7884">{{Other uses|ERA (disambiguation)}}
{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and "[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the "[[Big Band|Big Band era]]", "[[Disco era]]", etc.

{{Nationalism sidebar}}

'''Ethnosymbolism''' is a [[school of thought]] in the study of [[nationalism]] that stresses the importance of symbols, myths, values and traditions in the formation and persistence of the modern [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerges as the critical theory of [[Nationalism#Modernist interpretation|modernism]], which argues the antiquity and ''la [[longue durée]]'' of nation while modernists believe nation's purely modern appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and Modernism|year=1998|publisher=London and New York: Routledge|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=|date=July 2017}} [[John Alexander Armstrong|John A. Armstrong]], [[Anthony D. Smith]] and [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]] are regarded as important theorists of ethnosymbolism.

The term was first used as "ethno-symbolist approach" in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the [[London School of Economics]]. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing: "if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function".&lt;ref&gt;Conversi, Daniele (1995) 'Reassessing current theories of nationalism: Nationalism as boundary maintenance and creation', [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537119508428421#.UxovkhYeXkc Nationalism and Ethnic Politics], 1, 1, pp. 73 - 85 (p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt;
== Important theorists and theories ==

=== John A. Armstrong ===
Armstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his '''myth-symbol complexes''' in ''Nations before Nationalism'' published in 1982, which firstly underlined the significance of ''la [[longue durée]]'' according to Anthony D. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=History and National Destiny: Responses and Clarifications|year=2004|editor-last=Guibernau|editor-first=M.|editor2-last=Hutchinson|editor2-first=John|journal=History and National Identity: Ethnosymoblism and its Critics|publisher=Blackwell|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness has existed for long, whose traces could even be found in ancient civilisations such as [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and nationalism is merely "the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization". Therefore, similar to the ''longue durée'' of [[Annales School]], formation of ethnic identity should be examined in time dimensions of many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He emphasised the boundaries for human identity by adopting the social interaction model of [[Fredrik Barth]] and argues that "groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers{{Single double}}. In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Hence, comparing to the objective group characteristics, the boundary mechanisms of distinguishing a particular group from others should be studied more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Nations before Nationalism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1982|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His conception of ethnic group defined by exclusion rules out any definitional way to distinguish ethnicity from other collective identity including religious and class identities, for which reason himself is more concerned with the shifting interactions among class, ethnic religious loyalties than with "compartmentalizing definitions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Nations before Nationalism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1982|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Armstrong, "myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors", which indicates his emphasis on the persistence of these symbolic boundary mechanisms. He further specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence. The first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam both of which gave birth to different civilisations and the myths/symbols. The third factor is city, whose effect upon ethnic identification 'requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact
of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the [[Lübeck law|Lübeck]] and [[Magdeburg law]]. 

The fourth factor is imperial polities' role, whose central question is "how could the intense consciousness of loyalty and identity established through face-to-face contact in the city-state transferred to the larger agglomerations of cities and countryside known as empires"? The [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] myth of the polity as a reflection of heavenly rule, being called ''[[mythomoteur]]'' by Armstrong, is exemplified as "myth transference for political purposes" since it was used as vehicle for incorporating city-state loyalties in a larger framework.

The last factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that "the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent" in pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in his later works, he agrees with most modernists including [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]] that national identity had been an invention, and the only remaining disagreement would be "over the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|editor-last=Periwal|editor-first=S.|journal=Notions of Nationalism|last=Armstrong|first=John A.|title=Towards a Theory of Nationalism: Consensus and Disconsensus|publisher=Central European University Press|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthony D. Smith ===
Although a former student of [[Ernest Gellner]], who is considered to represent [[Nationalism#Modernist interpretation|modernism]], [[Anthony D. Smith]] has perspectives of nationalism that differentiate him from his teacher. He is also the last contributor to the "[[London School of Economics|LSE]] debate" on nationalism (named by Gellner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|title=Encounters with Nationalism|publisher=Oxford:Blackwell|year=1995|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; His central thesis is that "modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkırımlı|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism|year= 2000|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has suggested theorists to define key terms such as "nation" and "nationalism" beyond the theoretical limitation of both modernism and [[primordialism]]. In his opinion, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as "modern nation" with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] and partial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=THe Genealogy of Nations: An Ethno-Symbolic Approach|editor-last=Ichijo|editor-first=A.|editor2-last=Uzelac|editor2-first=G.|journal=When is the Nation?|publisher=London and New York: Routeledge|year=2005|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he proposes an ideal-typical definition of the nation: "a named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members".

He also introduces the important term '''''ethnie''''', a French word meaning "ethnic group", which is used to describe the pre-modern ethnic communities and contains six main attributes:

#a collective proper name
#a myth of common ancestry
#shared historical memories
#one or more differentiating elements of common culture
#an association with a specific "homeland"
#a sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population.

These six attributes suggest that ''ethnie'' is "anything but primordial", for which reason that ''ethnie'' is formed and constructed.  Its formation is with two patterns: coalescence and division.  The former unites separate units, while the latter functions conversely.

According to Smith's observation, there are four main mechanisms of ethnic self-renewal:

#religious reform, exemplified with the history of [[Jews]].
#cultural borrowing, exemplified with encounter between [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] and [[culture of Greece|Greek]] cultures
#popular participation, exemplified with the socio-religious popular movement of the [[Mazdak#Mazdakism|Mazdakites]] in 5th-century [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]] undermining the foundations of the Sassanid state.
#myths of ethnic election, the lack of which might be related to the diminishment of ethnic survival of [[Assyria]], [[Phoenicia]] and the [[Philistines]].

In order to understand "why and how does the nation emerge?", Smith identifies two types of ethnic community: the lateral (aristocratic) and the vertical (demotic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=National Identity|publisher=London: Penguin|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his more recent work, Smith has added the third route of nation formation: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ''ethnies'', such as the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and Modernism: A Criticle Survey of Recent Theories of Nations and Nationalism|publisher=London and New York: Routledge|year=1998|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Hutchinson ===
[[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]] was supervised by Smith while undertaking his PhD at the London School of Economics. His primary contribution to ethnosymbolism is the theory of '''cultural nationalism''' in ''the Dynamics of Cultural Nationalism'' (1987).

He separates nationalism into political nationalism and cultural nationalism, which are different, even competing conceptions of the nation, and "have sharply diverging political strategies".

Political nationalists are essentially [[cosmopolitism|cosmopolitan]] [[rationalists]] whose conception of nation "looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences".  Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to "secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization". Nationalism in most West European states after 18th century meets the criterion of political nationalism, which is also the nationalism that modernists including [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Benedict Anderson]] refer to in their works.

On the contrary, cultural nationalists believe that humanity is "infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality" similar to nature. They regard the state being accidental since a nation is essentially its distinctive civilisation which is "the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile". Nations are ''organic entities'' and living personalities. In perspectives of cultural nationalists, nation is on the passions implanted by nature and history rather than "mere" consent or law. As the ''organic entity'', conflict, generally between ''ageing traditionalists'' and ''the educated young'', is not only inevitable for nation but also indispensable for nation's continuous renovation and regeneration. Such conclusion of features of cultural nationalism is based upon Hutchinson's observation of nationalism of late nineteenth century India and China, respectively represented by  [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Liang Qichao]]. On the other hand, cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=John|title=Cultural Nationalism and Moral Regenration|editor-last=Hutchinson|editor-first=J.|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=A. D.|journal=Nationalism|year=1994|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|pages=122–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in ''Nations as Zones of Conflict'' (2005).

'''Research funding''' is a term generally covering any funding for scientific [[research]], in the areas of both "hard" [[science]] and [[technology]] and [[social science]]. The term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds.

Most research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through [[research and development]] departments) and government (primarily carried out through universities and specialized government agencies; often known as ''research councils''). Some small amounts of scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations, especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as [[cancer]], [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to [[OECD]], more than 60% of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industries, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2015_sti_scoreboard-2015-en|title=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015: Innovation for growth and society |last= |first= |publisher=OECD |year=2015 |isbn=9789264239784 |location= |pages=156 |doi=10.1787/sti_scoreboard-2015-en |quote=|via=oecd-ilibrary.org|series=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively, in countries with less GDP, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly lower. The US government spends more than other countries on military R&amp;D, although the proportion has fallen from around 30% in the 1980s to under 20.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Government funding for medical research amounts to approximately 36%&lt;!-- OF WHAT?? --&gt; in the U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for ''basic'' scientific research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialization possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = R.A. | year = 2012 | title = Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735193312002199 | journal = International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer | volume = 39 | issue = 10| pages = 1467–1473 | doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of science policy}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the [[industrial revolution]], most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual [[inventor]]s using their own funds. A system of [[patent]]s was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. [[Charles Goodyear]]) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as [[corporation]]s developed, and discovered that continuous investment in [[research and development]] could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors - circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad - was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of [[Wilkinson Sword]] and [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] in the [[disposable razor]] market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==National funding by country==
{{Main|List of countries by research and development spending}}
Different countries spend vastly different amounts on research, in both absolute and relative terms. For instance, [[South Korea]] and [[Israel]] spend more than 4% of their GDP on research while many Arabic countries spend less than 1% (e.g. [[Saudi Arabia]] 0.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gross domestic spending on R&amp;D (indicator)|doi=10.1787/d8b068b4-en|url=https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
The US spent $456.1 billion for research and development (R&amp;D) in 2013, the most recent year for which such figures are available, according to the [[National Science Foundation]]. The private sector accounted for $322.5 billion, or 71%, of total national expenditures, with universities and colleges spending $64.7 billion, or 14%, in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|year=2016|title=Microbiology Policy Bulletin Board|url=http://www.asmscience.org/docserver/fulltext/microbe/11/4/microbe_11_4.pdf|journal=Microbe Magazine|volume=11|pages=145|via=ASM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] spent CHF 22 billion for R&amp;D in 2015 with an increase of 10.5% compared with 2012 when the last survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recherche et développement en Suisse 2015 (press release)|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/actualites/communiques-presse.assetdetail.2422944.html |accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relative terms, this represents 3.4% of the country's GDP. R&amp;D activities are carried out by nearly 125,000 individuals, mostly in the private sector (71%) and higher education institutions (27%).

==Process==
Often scientists apply for research funding which a granting agency may (or may not) approve to financially support.  These ''grants'' require a lengthy process as the granting agency can inquire about the researcher(s)'s background, the facilities used, the equipment needed, the time involved, and the overall potential of the scientific outcome.  The process of grant writing and grant proposing is a somewhat delicate process for both the grantor and the grantee:  the grantors want to choose the research that best fits their scientific principles, and the individual grantees want to apply for research in which they have the best chances but also in which they can build a body of work towards future scientific endeavors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] in the United Kingdom has devised an alternative method of fund-distribution: the sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency.&lt;ref&gt;
Gonzales, Evelina Garza, "External Funding and Tenure at Texas State University-San Marcos" (2009). Texas State University. Applied Research Projects. Paper 315.  http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/315
&lt;/ref&gt;
"Research administration is all about service—service to our faculty, to our academic units, to the institution, and to our sponsors.  To be of service, we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations."&lt;ref&gt;
Robert A. Killoren, Jr., Associate Vice President for Research, Office of Sponsored Programs, Penn State U, Fall 2005.  From Lowry, Peggy (2006)  "Assessing the Sponsored Research Office". ''[http://www.aiseducation.com/RAG_product.html SPONSORED RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION: A Guide to Effective Strategies and Recommended Practices ]''
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, the [[National Council of University Research Administrators]] (NCURA) serves its members and advances the field of research administration through education and professional development programs, the sharing of knowledge and experience, and by fostering a professional, collegial, and respected community.

===Public funding===
{{Main article|Science policy}}
{{see also|Research council|United States national laboratories (disambiguation){{!}}United States national laboratories|Federally funded research and development centers|label 3 = List of federally-funded research and development centers (US)}}
Government-funded research can either be carried out by the government itself, or through [[Grant (money)|grants]] to researchers outside the government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The bodies providing public funding are often referred to as ''research councils''.

Critics{{Who|date=December 2014}} of [[basic research]] are concerned that research funding for the sake of knowledge itself does not contribute to a great return.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  However, scientific innovations often foreshadow or inspire further ideas unintentionally. For example, NASA's quest to put a man on the moon inspired them to develop better sound recording and reading technologies.  NASA's research was furthered by the music industry, who used it to develop audio cassettes.  Audio cassettes, being smaller and able to store more music, quickly dominated the music industry and increased the availability of music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

An additional distinction of government-sponsored research is that the government does not make a claim to the [[intellectual property]], whereas private research-funding bodies sometimes claim ownership of the intellectual property that they are paying to have developed. Consequently, government-sponsored research more often allows the individual discoverer to file intellectual property claims over their own work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====List of research councils====
Research councils are (usually public) bodies that provide research funding in the form of research grants or [[scholarship]]s.  These include [[arts council]]s and research councils for the funding of science.

===Private funding===
Private funding for research comes from philanthropists,&lt;ref name="Billionaire Ideas"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/science/billionaires-with-big-ideas-are-privatizing-american-science.html?_r=0|author=William J.

Examples of companies that fund basic research include IBM (high temperature superconductivity was [[High-temperature superconductivity|discovered by IBM sponsored basic experimental research]] in 1986), L'Oreal (which created the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science|L'Oreal-Unesco prize for women scientists]] and finances internships), AXA (which launched a [http://www.axa-research.org/ Research Fund] in 2008 and finances Academic Institutions such as advanced fundamental mathematics French Foundation IHES).

A company may share resources with a [[materials science]] society to gain proprietary knowledge or trained workers.

===Hard money versus soft money===
In academic contexts, '''hard money''' may refer to funding received from a government or other entity at regular intervals, thus providing a steady inflow of financial resources to the beneficiary. The antonym, '''soft money''', refers to funding provided only through competitive [[research grant]]s and the writing of grant proposals.&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"&gt;[http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/30627 "What is a soft-money research position?"], Academia StackExchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard money is usually issued by the government for the advancement of certain projects or for the benefit of specific agencies. Community [[healthcare]], for instance, may be supported by the government by providing hard money. Since funds are disbursed regularly and continuously, the offices in charge of such projects are able to achieve their objectives more effectively than if they had been issued one-time grants.

Individual jobs at a research institute may be classified as "hard-money positions" or "soft-money positions";&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"/&gt; the former are expected to provide [[job security]] because their funding is secure in the long term, whereas individual "soft-money" positions may come and go with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded to the institution.

==Influence on research==
The source of funding may introduce conscious or unconscious biases into a researcher's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (COIs) is used by biomedical journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process. Conflict of interest disclosure, however, is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals which publish scientific research results.  When research is funded by the same agency that can be expected to gain from a favorable outcome there is a potential for biased results and research shows that results are indeed more favorable than would be expected from a more objective view of the evidence. A 2003 [[systematic review]] studied  the scope and impact of industry sponsorship in biomedical research.  The researchers found financial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions  widespread.  Results  showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions and concluded that "Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Relationship between Funding Source and Conclusion among Nutrition-Related Scientific Articles|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e5|work=[[PLOS Medicine]]|publisher=[[PLOS]]|author1=Lenard I Lesser |author2=Cara B Ebbeling |author3=Merrill Goozner |author4=David Wypij |author5=David S Ludwig |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040005|pmid=17214504|pmc=1764435|date=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British study found that a majority of the members on national and food policy committees receive funding from food companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food company sponsorship of nutrition research and professional activities: a conflict of interest?|volume=4|issue=5|pages=1015–1022|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=566532|work=[[Public Health Nutrition]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Marion Nestle|doi=10.1079/PHN2001253|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to cut costs, the pharmaceutical industry has turned to the use of private, nonacademic research groups (i.e., contract research organizations [CROs]) which can do the work for less money than academic investigators.  In 2001 CROs came under criticism when the editors of 12 major scientific journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication of any studies in which their product did poorly. They further criticized the trial methodology  stating that researchers are frequently restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 81460 | pmid=11584570 | volume=165 | issue=6 | title=Sponsorship, authorship and accountability |date=September 2001 | journal=CMAJ | pages=786–8| author1=Davidoff | first1=F | last2=Deangelis | first2=C.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], a worldwide group that aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions,  conducts [[systematic review]]s of [[randomized controlled trial]]s of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Eur J Clin Nutr|date=August 2005|volume=59|series=Suppl 1|issue=S1|pages=S147–S149|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602188|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n1s/full/1602188a.html|accessdate=31 January 2012|pmid=16052183|last1=Scholten|first1=R. J.|last2=Clarke|first2=M|last3=Hetherington|first3=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/|title=Cochrane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few more recent reviews have also studied the results of non-randomized, [[Observational study|observational studies]]. The systematic reviews are published in the [[Cochrane Library]]. A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests [COI] in underlying research studies used for medical [[meta-analyses]] reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that COIs in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.   The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author COI disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded "without acknowledgement of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies|work=The Cochrane Collaboration website|publisher=[[Cochrane Collaboration]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 researchers looked at the association between authors' published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of [[olestra]], a [[fat substitute]] manufactured by the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry.  They found that supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with P&amp;G and all authors disclosing an affiliation with P&amp;G were supportive.  The authors of the study concluded: "Because authors' published opinions were associated with their financial relationships, obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Authors' Financial Relationships With the Food and Beverage Industry and Their Published Positions on the Fat Substitute Olestra| pmc=1447808 | pmid=12660215|volume=93| issue=4 |year=2003|pages=664–9 | last1 = Levine | first1 = J | last2 = Gussow | first2 = JD | last3 = Hastings | first3 = D | last4 = Eccher | first4 = A | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.4.664 | journal=American Journal of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study in the journal Nature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15944677|year=2005|last1=Martinson|first1=BC|last2=Anderson|first2=MS|last3=De Vries|first3=R|title=Scientists behaving badly|volume=435|issue=7043|pages=737–8|doi=10.1038/435737a|journal=Nature|bibcode=2005Natur.435..737M}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 3247 US researchers who were all publicly funded (by the [[National Institutes of Health]]). Out of the scientists questioned, 15.5% admitted to altering design, methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source.

A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fang | first1 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Peer review and over-competitive research funding fostering mainstream opinion to monopoly | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 293–301 | doi=10.1007/s11192-010-0323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency of funding ==
Most funding agencies mandate efficient use of their funds, that is, they want to maximize outcome for their money spent. Outcome can be measured by [[Scientific literature|publication]] output, [[citation impact]], number of [[Patent|patents]], number of [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhDs]] awarded etc. Another question is how to allocate funds to different disciplines, institutions, or researchers. A recent study by Wayne Walsh found that “prestigious institutions had on average 65% higher grant application success rates and 50% larger award sizes, whereas less-prestigious institutions produced 65% more publications and had a 35% higher citation impact per dollar of funding.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/research-dollars-go-farther-at-less-prestigious-institutions--study-64529|title=Research Dollars Go Farther at Less-Prestigious Institutions: Study|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahls|first=Wayne P.|date=2018-07-13|title=High cost of bias: Diminishing marginal returns on NIH grant funding to institutions|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/367847|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=367847|doi=10.1101/367847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">'''Gender budgeting''' means preparing [[budget]]s or analysis them from a gender perspective. Also referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting, this practice does not entail dividing budgets for women. It aims at dealing with budgetary [[gender inequality]] issues, including gender hierarchies and the discrepancies between women's and men's salaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender budgeting allows governments to promote equality through fiscal policies by taking analyses of a budget's differing impacts on the sexes as well as setting goals or targets for equality and allocating funds to support those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-2|title=What is gender budgeting?|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main activities ==
Three principal activities have been recognized as gender budgeting sensitive:
# At the institutional level, the goal is to understand policies promoted by governmental institutions and how these affect gender inequalities within a specific society.
# Analysis of the institutional budget, in order to see whether [[gender mainstreaming]] activities are included.
# Planning as well as implementing a gender-based budget that will focus on gender-related issues.
Point 3 most likely includes the restructuration of the existing budget to deal with gender-related issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender budget analysis ==
Gender budget analysis aims at finding out whether women and men have can access the same opportunities equally. In gender budget analysis, gaps are addressed so that those who are disadvantaged become empowered. A gender-sensitive budget analysis contains how budgets recognize and answer the needs of men and women, whether they are children, young or adults.&lt;ref&gt;Balmori, H. H. 2003.

[[File:Logo_UFZ.png|right|frameless|275px]]
The work of the '''Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ''' (prior to 28 November 2006  UFZ-Umweltforschungszentrum Leipzig-Halle GmbH) covers both basic research and applied research.

The UFZ was established on 12 December 1991. The Centre commenced its research activities on 2 January 1992. The UFZ has locations in [[Leipzig]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]]. In addition, it operates experimental stations in Bad Lauchstädt and Falkenberg. The UFZ employs a total of 1,050 employees (as of 31 December 2016).

The UFZ has been operating KUBUS, a modern communications and event venue in Leipzig, since 2004. KUBUS has flexible event spaces in a range of sizes and accommodates up to 550 people.

== Research areas ==

As an international competence centre for environmental sciences, the UFZ investigates interrelationships between humans and nature under the influence of global change. The research activities of UFZ scientists focus on the terrestrial environment – on densely populated urban and industrial conurbations, on agricultural landscapes and near-natural landscapes. They examine issues relating to future land use, the preservation of biological diversity and of ecosystem services, the sustainable management of soil and water resources and the effect of chemicals on humans and the environment – from the level of single cells and organisms up to the scale of regions.

The work of the UFZ is characterised by integrated environmental research that overcomes disciplinary boundaries between the natural and social sciences (interdisciplinarity) and brings together decision-makers from business, government and society (transdisciplinarity). Major scientific infrastructures such as climate and land-use experiments (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=40038 GCEF Global Change Experimental Facility], [http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38050 ProVis Centre for the visualisation of biochemical processes at cellular level]), platforms and technologies for environmental monitoring (e.g. [http://www.tereno.net/overview-en?set_language=en TERENO terrestrial environmental observatories]), modelling and visualisation (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=37716 TESSIN/VisLab Terrestrial Environmental System Simulation &amp; Integration Network]) have been or are being initiated, developed and used as part of cooperation arrangements and networks at national and international level.

The goal of UFZ research is to identify ways in which fundamental natural resources can be used sustainably for the well-being of humans and the environment.

== Research organisation ==
[[File:Research structure ufz.jpg|thumb|500px|Research organisation of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research]]

The integrated environmental research carried out by the UFZ is organised into six topic areas. Topic areas 1–4 address core topics; topic areas 5 and 6 comprise cross-sectional competences:

These topic areas have been developed by the UFZ in response to challenges facing society in times of global change: climate change, land-use change, population growth, societies working under conditions of scarcity, globalisation, urbanisation, decline in biodiversity, rising energy and food demands, rising quantity and variety of chemicals impacting people and the environment, new patterns in national and global governance.

A total of 36 method-oriented departments are assigned to the six strategic topic areas. The large number of departments shows the wide subject range and diversity of research at the UFZ:

== Member, cooperation arrangements, networks, certifications ==

The UFZ is a member of the [https://www.helmholtz.de Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]. Eighteen natural/engineering sciences and medical/biological research centres with over 38,000 employees and an annual budget of over four billion euros came together to create the association. The UFZ carries out research in three of the total of six areas of Helmholtz Association research: (1) Earth and Environment (85 % of UFZ resources), (2) Energy (8 %) and (3) Health (7 %).

The UFZ cooperates and works with a large number of government agencies, research facilities and organisations at a national and international level (including UNEP, EU, [http://www.ipcc.ch/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)], [https://www.ipbes.net/ Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)], the [https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en Federal Environment Agency (UBA)], the [http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/home.html Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR)], and the [https://www.bfn.de/en.html Federal Environment Agency (BfN)]).

UFZ is a member of [http://www.peer.eu/ PEER (Partnership for European Environmental Research)]. PEER is a network of eight European environmental research centres, and was established in 2001. Over 5,000 people are employed in PEER centres. The total budget of all eight centres is around €430 million per year. By carrying out joint research projects and fostering cooperation between European and international researchers, PEER aims to contribute to the strengthening of environmental research and its role at the European level.

The UFZ, together with the universities of Leipzig, Halle-Wittenberg and Jena and other research facilities, is a cooperation partner of the [https://www.idiv.de/ German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)], which was established in 2012. iDiv is based in Leipzig and is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).

The UFZ has been accredited under EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit System) since 2005. It has been certified under the “berufundfamilie” (job and family) audit since 2014.

== Funding ==
The basic funding for the UFZ is provided by the Federal Republic of Germany (90%) and the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt (5% each) to a total of €64.9 million. The total budget including third-party funds and other income is €89.6 million (as of Dec. 2016).

The '''Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)''' is an international centre for biological and [[biomedical research]] and graduate training based in Oeiras, Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=IGC {{!}} A Special Place to Be|date=2014-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9y874pZeJw&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] (FCG) in 1961, and still supported by the Foundation, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure.

The scientific programme covers a wide range of domains and is at the interface of different disciplines. These include cell and [[developmental biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]] and [[host-pathogen interaction]], [[Botany|plant biology]], sociobiology, [[computational biology]] and [[biophysics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=213___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Research {{!}} About IGC Research|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC has state-of-the-art facilities and services, constantly updated and ready to explore new scientific ideas. All resources are at the disposal of all IGC scientists equally, and common services and equipment are also open to external users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/facilities/about|title=IGC {{!}} Serviços {{!}} Sobre Serviços IGC|last=|first=|date=|website=wwwpt.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC hosts a number of [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] and training programmes. Since 1993 the IGC runs innovative [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD programmes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/phdprogrammes|title=IGC {{!}} Education and Training {{!}} PhD Programmes|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, directed towards intellectual breadth, creativity and independent scientific thought. Also, the IGC has a strong tradition in promoting science in society with dedicated outreach programmes. 

Around 400 people, including 300 researchers (students, postdocs, technicians and group leaders), from 41 different countries work at the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=121___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Facts and Figures|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, 88 research groups have already settled in the institute. Of these, 44 went to other institutions, mainly other research centres and universities in Portugal.

In 1998, under the Directorship of [[António Coutinho]], the IGC was restructured into the current set-up and mode of action. Jonathan Howard succeeded Coutinho as Director of the IGC from October 2012 until January 2018. Since 1 February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]] is the Director of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.   

==History==
The establishment of the IGC was initiated in 1961 when the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s board of trustees envisioned the creation of its own research centre to encourage multidisciplinary research, independent of universities, and without restrictions or prior interests. The original set up of the IGC included a Centre for Scientific Calculation (1962-1985), a Centre for Biology (1962), a centre for Pedagogical Innovation (1962-1980), a Centre for Agricultural Economy (1958-1986) and a Centre for Economy and Finances.  A new building alongside the Marquês de Pombal Palace, in Oeiras, was projected to make up the new campus planned with a set of infrastructures including laboratories, library, canteen and animal facility. In 1967, the Centre for Biology was officially inaugurated at the new Oeiras campus with four research groups in Cell Biology, Pharmacology, Microbiology and Physiology and around 20 researchers. From 1966 to 1969, four IGC leaders passed away: Delfim Santos (Pedagogical Innovation), António Gião (Scientific Calculation), Flávio Resende (Biology) and Luís Quartin Graça (Agricultural Economy).

In 1968 Luís Archer, jesuit priest and biologist, widely regarded as the ‘father' of molecular genetics in Portugal, returns to Portugal to set up the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the IGC, in the Department of Cell Biology. The year after, in 1969, it was set up the ''Estudos Avançados de Oeiras'' (Oeiras Advanced Studies) to provide workshops, summer schools and international seminars to scientists.

In 1984, the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s Board of Trustees decides that IGC will be a research centre exclusively dedicated to research and pos-graduated training in biology.

In 1989 the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB) and the [http://www.ibet.pt/ Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica] (iBET) were created and hosted in the IGC campus. With IGC, they will later form the Oeiras Campus.

[[António Coutinho]], immunologist and Head of the Immunobiology Unit in [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]], is appointed the Director of the Oeiras Advanced Studies in 1991. In 1993 Coutinho starts the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM), a pioneering programme in Portugal and one of the first of this kind in the world. In 1998, António Coutinho is designated Director of the IGC and starts a new phase of the institute as a ‘host institution' with the mission of identifying, educating and incubating new research leaders, providing access to facilities, and financial and intellectual autonomy to pursue research projects.

The Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme at the IGC is established in 2006 and the research groups of the newly formed [[Champalimaud Foundation]] are hosted at the IGC to carry out research in systems neuroscience until 2011, when they move to the Champalimaud Foundation’s new building in Lisbon.

In 2008, the IGC participates for the first time in the music festival [[NOS Alive]] under a partnership established between “Everything is New”, promoter of NOS Alive, and the IGC to support fellowships for young researchers.

In 2010 and 2011, the IGC was ranked amongst the '10 Best Places for Post-docs' outside the USA, by [http://www.the-scientist.com/ The Scientist].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/30743/title/Best-Places-to-Work-Postdocs--2011/|title=Best Places to Work Postdocs, 2011|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC celebrates its 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary in 2011 and was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Ordem de Sant'Iago da Espada by the [[President of Portugal|President of the Portuguese Republic]].

The [http://cedoc.unl.pt/ Centro de Estudos de Doenças Crónicas] (CEDOC), from N [http://www.fcm.unl.pt/main/index.php?lang=en&amp;Itemid=351 OVA Medical School | Faculdade de Ciências Médicas] (NMS|FCM), incubated in IGC, moved in 2014 to its new building in Lisbon.

Jonathan Howard, immunologist and Professor of Genetics at the [[University of Cologne]], is appointed Director of the IGC in 2012, succeeding António Coutinho. Since February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] is the new Director of the IGC, succeeding Jonathan Howard.

==Research==

=== Main Accomplishments ===
- A study published in ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]'' in July 2018, coordinated by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]], helped to better understand diseases that involve cells antennae, called [[Ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The researchers found that while cells use the same building materials for their antennae, they use them in different proportions and moments, thus creating the structurally different functions.This explains how their mutations, which occur in genetic diseases associated with [[Cilium|cilia]] (e.g. diseases leading to infertility, loss of vision, obesity), usually affect only some antennae, not all of them, and some patients show all of the symptoms, while others may have only one type of defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jana|first=Swadhin Chandra|last2=Mendonça|first2=Susana|last3=Machado|first3=Pedro|last4=Werner|first4=Sascha|last5=Rocha|first5=Jaqueline|last6=Pereira|first6=António|last7=Maiato|first7=Helder|last8=Bettencourt-Dias|first8=Mónica|date=2018-07-16|title=Differential regulation of transition zone and centriole proteins contributes to ciliary base diversity|journal=Nature Cell Biology|language=En|volume=20|issue=8|pages=928–941|doi=10.1038/s41556-018-0132-1|pmid=30013109|issn=1465-7392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Joana Gonçalves-Sá and Luís Rocha showed that there is a specific mood associated with religious celebrations, a "loving mood" that can influence human reproductive behaviour. Using worldwide data from [[Twitter]] and [[Google Trends]] they found that culture, and not only biology, drives human reproductive cycles. The study was published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Ian B.|last2=Varela|first2=Pedro L.|last3=Bollen|first3=Johan|last4=Rocha|first4=Luis M.|last5=Gonçalves-Sá|first5=Joana|date=2017-12|title=Human Sexual Cycles are Driven by Culture and Match Collective Moods|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18262-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17973|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5|pmid=29269945|pmc=5740080|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group devoted to the study of the biological causes underlying obesity published a breakthrough study in ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' in October 2017. They discovered an unforeseen population of immune cells ([[macrophage]]s) associated with [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic neurons]] in adipose tissue. These specialised macrophages are in direct contact with neurons and affect neuronal activation that is critical for fat mass reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171009123158.htm|title=Making fat mice lean: Novel immune cells control neurons responsible for fat breakdown|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirzgalska|first=Roksana M|last2=Seixas|first2=Elsa|last3=Seidman|first3=Jason S|last4=Link|first4=Verena M|last5=Sánchez|first5=Noelia Martínez|last6=Mahú|first6=Inês|last7=Mendes|first7=Raquel|last8=Gres|first8=Vitka|last9=Kubasova|first9=Nadiya|date=2017-10-09|title=Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages contribute to obesity by importing and metabolizing norepinephrine|journal=Nature Medicine|language=En|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1309–1318|doi=10.1038/nm.4422|pmid=29035364|issn=1078-8956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- For many years biologists have wondered why plants have so many genes coding for proteins that are known to be essential for the nervous system of animals, called [[glutamate receptor]]s. A team led by Jose Feijó discovered a new function of these proteins, showing that moss sperm uses them to navigate towards the female organs and ensure offspring. The study was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz-Ramírez|first=Carlos|last2=Michard|first2=Erwan|last3=Simon|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Damineli|first4=Daniel S.

- Using experimental models of [[sepsis]] in mice, a research team led by Miguel Soares discovered an unsuspected mechanism that is protective against sepsis. The study was published in the scientific journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in June 2017 and provided new avenues for therapeutic approaches against sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Sebastian|last2=Carlos|first2=Ana Rita|last3=Moita|first3=Maria Raquel|last4=Singh|first4=Sumnima|last5=Blankenhaus|first5=Birte|last6=Cardoso|first6=Silvia|last7=Larsen|first7=Rasmus|last8=Rebelo|first8=Sofia|last9=Schäuble|first9=Sascha|date=2017-06|title=Metabolic Adaptation Establishes Disease Tolerance to Sepsis|journal=Cell|volume=169|issue=7|pages=1263–1275.e14|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.031|issn=0092-8674|pmc=5480394|pmid=28622511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Moisés Mallo and his research group have discovered the key factor that regulates trunk [[Developmental biology|development]] in [[vertebrate]]s and explains why [[snake]]s have such a strikingly different body. These findings published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' in August 2016, contributed to understand the origin of the exceptionally long trunks that characterise the body of [[snake]]s and may open new avenues to the study of [[spinal cord]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aires|first=Rita|last2=Jurberg|first2=Arnon D.|last3=Leal|first3=Francisca|last4=Nóvoa|first4=Ana|last5=Cohn|first5=Martin J.|last6=Mallo|first6=Moisés|date=2016-08|title=Oct4 Is a Key Regulator of Vertebrate Trunk Length Diversity|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=262–274|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.06.021|pmid=27453501|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shylo|first=Natalia A.|last2=Weatherbee|first2=Scott D.|date=2016-08|title=Of Mice and Snakes: A Tail of Oct4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580716305135|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=224–226|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.07.020|pmid=27505413|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] shed light upon the critical mechanism of how [[oocyte]]s, the maternal gametes, lose [[centriole]]s and the importance of doing so for female fertility. The results published in the scientific journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in May 2016 showed that [[centriole]]s normally have a coating that protects them which is lost inside the oocyte, eliminating therefore the centrioles. They further show that if the centrioles are not eliminated, those mothers are sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimenta-Marques|first=A.|last2=Bento|first2=I.|last3=Lopes|first3=C. a.

- IGC scientists led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira found that certain organs, such as the gut, start to age before other tissues because its cells have a "timekeeper" with a faster pace. The results published in the journal [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in January 2016 also showed that monitoring the pace of these timekeepers can be a good indicator for the aging of the whole organism since the appearance of local age-related lesions anticipates the onset of age-associated diseases, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Madalena C.|last2=Henriques|first2=Catarina M.|last3=Nabais|first3=Joana|last4=Ferreira|first4=Tânia|last5=Carvalho|first5=Tânia|last6=Ferreira|first6=Miguel Godinho|date=2016-01-20|title=Short Telomeres in Key Tissues Initiate Local and Systemic Aging in Zebrafish|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e1005798|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005798|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4720274|pmid=26789415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Research led by Raquel Oliveira, has elucidated how cells are almost blind to [[chromosome]] cohesion defects. The results published in ''[[Cell Reports]]'' in October 2015 uncovered how these defects, often associated with [[cancer]] development, [[congenital diseases]] and [[infertility]], evade the strict surveillance of the checkpoint mechanisms that ensure faithful [[genome]] segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group have shown that [[Adipose tissue|fat tissue]] is [[Nerve|innervated]] and that direct stimulation of [[neuron]]s in fat is sufficient to induce fat breakdown. These results published in September 2015 in the journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], set up the stage for developing novel [[Anti-obesity medication|anti-obesity]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Wenwen|last2=Pirzgalska|first2=Roksana M.|last3=Pereira|first3=Mafalda M.A.|last4=Kubasova|first4=Nadiya|last5=Barateiro|first5=Andreia|last6=Seixas|first6=Elsa|last7=Lu|first7=Yi-Hsueh|last8=Kozlova|first8=Albina|last9=Voss|first9=Henning|date=2015-09|title=Sympathetic Neuro-adipose Connections Mediate Leptin-Driven Lipolysis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867415011071|journal=Cell|volume=163|issue=1|pages=84–94|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.055|pmid=26406372|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44093/title/Neuronal-Connection-Between-Fat-and-the-Brain-Visualized/|title=Neuronal Connection Between Fat and the Brain Visualized|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Studies on the [[bacteria]] ''[[Wolbachia]]'' conducted by Luis Teixeira and his research group revealed that a single genomic change can turn beneficial bacteria into [[pathogenic bacteria]], by boosting bacterial density inside the host. ''Wolbachia'' is a bacterium commonly present in [[insect]] species that can protect their hosts against [[virus]]es, including the [[dengue fever]] virus. These findings were published in the journal [[PLOS Biology|''PLoS Biology'']] in February 2015, in the first study linking genes and their functions in the ''Wolbachia'' bacterium and providing a starting point for the understanding of the widespread insect-''Wolbachia'' symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrostek|first=Ewa|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luis|date=2015-02-10|title=Mutualism Breakdown by Amplification of Wolbachia Genes|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=e1002065|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002065|issn=1545-7885|pmc=4323108|pmid=25668031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In a study published in the scientific journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']] in December 2014, a research team at IGC led by Miguel Soares discovered that specific bacterial components in the human [[Gut flora|gut]] [[microbiota]] can trigger a natural defence mechanism that is highly protective against [[malaria]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Bahtiyar|last2=Portugal|first2=Silvia|last3=Tran|first3=Tuan M.|last4=Gozzelino|first4=Raffaella|last5=Ramos|first5=Susana|last6=Gomes|first6=Joana|last7=Regalado|first7=Ana|last8=Cowan|first8=Peter J.|last9=d’Apice|first9=Anthony J.F.|date=2014-12|title=Gut Microbiota Elicits a Protective Immune Response against Malaria Transmission|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867414014251|journal=Cell|volume=159|issue=6|pages=1277–1289|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.053|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4261137|pmid=25480293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordon|first=Yvonne|date=2015-01|title=Gut bacteria cross malaria|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nri3796|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1038/nri3796|pmid=25534616|issn=1474-1733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=How gut bacteria are protective against malaria - Video animation|date=2014-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAhiECenPc&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Three research groups at IGC lead by Jocelyne Demengeot, Karina Xavier and Isabel Gordo joint efforts to unveil how the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), one of the first species to colonize the [[Gut flora|human gut]] at birth, adapts and evolves in the [[mouse]] intestine. The study published in [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in March 2014, showed that [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] with different advantageous [[mutation]]s rapidly emerge and, consequently, a large [[genetic variation]] in this species is generated over time demonstrating how rich the [[evolutionary dynamics]] of each bacteria is in a healthy animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barroso-Batista|first=João|last2=Sousa|first2=Ana|last3=Lourenço|first3=Marta|last4=Bergman|first4=Marie-Louise|last5=Sobral|first5=Daniel|last6=Demengeot|first6=Jocelyne|last7=Xavier|first7=Karina B.|last8=Gordo|first8=Isabel|date=2014-03-06|title=The First Steps of Adaptation of Escherichia coli to the Gut Are Dominated by Soft Sweeps|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e1004182|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004182|issn=1553-7404|pmc=3945185|pmid=24603313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Henrique Teotónio in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, both from the IGC, has experimentally tested the [[Haldane's rule|Haldane's theory]] for the first time. The study was published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in September 2013 and confirmed this theory for the introduction of a new beneficial [[allele]] in a population. The study contributes to a better comprehension of how a population can evolve, with implications for studies on how species adapt to changing environments or species conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chelo|first=Ivo M.|last2=Nédli|first2=Judit|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Teotónio|first4=Henrique|date=2013-09-13|title=An experimental test on the probability of extinction of new genetic variants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3417|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2417|doi=10.1038/ncomms3417|issn=2041-1723|pmc=3778522|pmid=24030070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130913085804.htm|title=Fate of new genes cannot be predicted|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In August 2013, the research team led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, showed for the first time that [[Chromosomal rearrangement|chromosomes rearrangements]] (such as inversions or translocations) can provide advantages to the cells that harbor them depending on the environment they are exposed. The study published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' contributes to better understand different biological problems such as: how cancer cells that have chromosomal rearrangements can outgrow normal cells or how organisms may evolve in the same physical location to form distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teresa Avelar|first=Ana|last2=Perfeito|first2=Lília|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Godinho Ferreira|first4=Miguel|date=2013-08-23|title=Genome architecture is a selectable trait that can be maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3235|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2235|doi=10.1038/ncomms3235|pmid=23974178|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The researcher Miguel Soares co-authored a review in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], in February 2012, on a largely overlooked strategy for treating [[infectious diseases]]. The [[immune system]] protects from infections by detecting and eliminating invading pathogens. The authors purposed a third strategy considering tolerance to infection, whereby the infected host protects itself from infection by reducing tissue damage and other negative effects caused by the pathogen or the immune response against the invader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medzhitov|first=Ruslan|last2=Schneider|first2=David S.|last3=Soares|first3=Miguel P.|date=2012-02-24|title=Disease Tolerance as a Defense Strategy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6071/936|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6071|pages=936–941|doi=10.1126/science.1214935|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3564547|pmid=22363001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In December 2011 the study published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' by Lar Jansen and his team uncovered a very simple, neat mechanism whereby the cell couples DNA duplication, [[cell division]] and [[centromere]] assembly. By using the same machinery for all these steps but in opposite ways, the cells confirm that the right number of copies of both genes and centromeres are made by allowing each the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Mariana C.C.|last2=Bodor|first2=Dani L.|last3=Stellfox|first3=Madison E.|last4=Martins|first4=Nuno M.C.|last5=Hochegger|first5=Helfrid|last6=Foltz|first6=Daniel R.|last7=Jansen|first7=Lars E.T.|date=2012-01|title=Cdk Activity Couples Epigenetic Centromere Inheritance to Cell Cycle Progression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580711004667|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=22|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.014|pmid=22169070|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The IGC has been part of the multinational team of researchers from 10 countries that sequenced the [[genome]] of the tiny spider mite in a study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in November 2011. The sequence of the [[spider mite]] genome has revealed the genetic basis for its feeding flexibility and pesticide resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grbić|first=Miodrag|last2=Van Leeuwen|first2=Thomas|last3=Clark|first3=Richard M.|last4=Rombauts|first4=Stephane|last5=Rouzé|first5=Pierre|last6=Grbić|first6=Vojislava|last7=Osborne|first7=Edward J.|last8=Dermauw|first8=Wannes|last9=Thi Ngoc|first9=Phuong Cao|date=2011-11|title=The genome of Tetranychus urticae reveals herbivorous pest adaptations|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature10640|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=479|issue=7374|pages=487–492|doi=10.1038/nature10640|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4856440|pmid=22113690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A team led by Florence Janody have uncovered a surprising link between the cell's skeleton and organ size. It was shown in a study published in ''Development'', in April 2011, that one of the proteins that regulates the [[Cytoskeleton|skeleton]] of the cell also acts to blocks activation of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation. These findings add to the puzzle of understanding how proliferation genes are abnormally activated, often leading to tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Beatriz García|last2=Gaspar|first2=Pedro|last3=Brás-Pereira|first3=Catarina|last4=Jezowska|first4=Barbara|last5=Rebelo|first5=Sofia Raquel|last6=Janody|first6=Florence|date=2011-06-01|title=Actin-Capping Protein and the Hippo pathway regulate F-actin and tissue growth in Drosophila|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/11/2337|journal=Development|language=en|volume=138|issue=11|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1242/dev.063545|issn=0950-1991|pmid=21525075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by Miguel Soares discovered how [[sickle cell anemia]] protects against malaria and published the study in the journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Ana|last2=Marguti|first2=Ivo|last3=Bechmann|first3=Ingo|last4=Jeney|first4=Viktória|last5=Chora|first5=Ângelo|last6=Palha|first6=Nuno R.|last7=Rebelo|first7=Sofia|last8=Henri|first8=Annie|last9=Beuzard|first9=Yves|date=2011-04|title=Sickle Hemoglobin Confers Tolerance to Plasmodium Infection|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867411003849|journal=Cell|volume=145|issue=3|pages=398–409|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.03.049|pmid=21529713|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- An international team led by José Feijó published a study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in March 2011, revealing that [[pollen]], the organ that contains the plant male gametes, communicate with the [[pistil]], their female counterpart, using a mechanism commonly observed in the nervous system of animals. The study showed a new mechanism which underlies reproduction in plants and how cell-cell communication is conserved between animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michard|first=Erwan|last2=Lima|first2=Pedro T.|last3=Borges|first3=Filipe|last4=Silva|first4=Ana Catarina|last5=Portes|first5=Maria Teresa|last6=Carvalho|first6=João E.|last7=Gilliham|first7=Matthew|last8=Liu|first8=Lai-Hua|last9=Obermeyer|first9=Gerhard|date=2011-04-22|title=Glutamate Receptor–Like Genes Form Ca2+ Channels in Pollen Tubes and Are Regulated by Pistil d-Serine|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6028/434|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6028|pages=434–437|doi=10.1126/science.1201101|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21415319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by Miguel Soares found that free [[heme]], released from red blood cells during infection, is the cause of organ failure, leading to the lethal outcome of severe [[sepsis]]. Moreover, the team found that the toxic effect of free heme can be overcome by hemopexin, a naturally occurring molecule that neutralises free heme. These findings were published in the ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' journal in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Rasmus|last2=Gozzelino|first2=Raffaella|last3=Jeney|first3=Viktória|last4=Tokaji|first4=László|last5=Bozza|first5=Fernando A.|last6=Japiassú|first6=André M.|last7=Bonaparte|first7=Dolores|last8=Cavalcante|first8=Moisés Marinho|last9=Chora|first9=Ângelo|date=2010-09-29|title=A Central Role for Free Heme in the Pathogenesis of Severe Sepsis|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/51/51ra71|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=2|issue=51|pages=51ra71|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001118|issn=1946-6234|pmid=20881280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A study published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'',]] in September 2010, by a team of researchers led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira solved a paradox related to [[telomere]]s, the protective tips of [[chromosome]]s. The broken chromosome ends generated by DNA damage are quickly joined together. However, telomeres are never tied to each other, thus allowing for the correct segregation of the genetic material into all cells. The researchers found that one of the [[histone]]s neighbouring the telomeres lacks a chemical signal, thus rendering the DNA damage recognition machinery incapable of arresting the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Tiago|last2=Khair|first2=Lyne|last3=Reis|first3=Clara C.|last4=Borges|first4=Vanessa|last5=Moser|first5=Bettina A.|last6=Nakamura|first6=Toru M.|last7=Ferreira|first7=Miguel Godinho|date=2010-09-09|title=Telomeres avoid end detection by severing the checkpoint signal transduction pathway|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=228–232|doi=10.1038/nature09353|issn=0028-0836|pmc=3196630|pmid=20829797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PhD Programmes ==
The IGC has started the postgraduate training with the format of a PhD programme in 1993 with the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM) followed by the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biomedicine (PGDB). In 2013, 20 years after the first structured PhD programme in Portugal, the [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia]] (FCT) started supporting the PhD Programme in Integrative Biomedical Sciences (PDIGC - PIBS) that has been continued as the [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/ibbprogramme PhD Programme in Integrative Biology and Biomedicine] (IBB), the current programme. In 2014, a new and ambitious [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/pgcd PhD programme was launched, the Graduate Program Science for Development] (PGCD) that aims to educate a new generation of excellent scientists and university professors in life sciences in the African countries of Portuguese language (PALOP) and East Timor.

The IGC is also part of a joint [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phdhostmicrointerface PhD Program Biology at the Host Microbe Interface] (INTERFACE) ran by the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB NOVA), Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) and [https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/en/ Instituto de Medicina Molecular] (iMM).

The IGC has also had two other PhD Programmes, the [http://pdbc.igc.gulbenkian.pt/index.php?menu=home PhD Programme in Computational Biology] (PDBC) the first doctoral programme in computational biology in Portugal launched in 2005, and the Programme for Advanced Medical Education (PGMFA), both important to fulfil gaps in research and training of these two fields.

== Science Outreach ==
The dialogue between scientists and society is crucial and the IGC is committed to promoting this interaction, both at the Institute and wider afield. Open Days, Researchers' Night, school's outreach and informal education programmes reach every year hundreds of students, teachers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/outreach|title=IGC {{!}} Outreach|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
The IGC is resourced with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and run by highly qualified staff. Facilities include bio-computing services, animal SPF ([[Specific-pathogen-free|Specific Pathogen Free]]) facilities including a "germ-free" unit, transgenics unit, plant facility, high-speed cell sorting, [[Electron microscope|electron]] and advanced microscopy, next generation sequencing, monoclonal antibody preparation and histopathology. Other services include a library, a dedicated in-house data center and IT team, as well as a research funding office and project management team.

The '''John Templeton Foundation''' ('''Templeton Foundation''') is a philanthropic organization that reflects the ideas of its founder, [[John Templeton]], who became wealthy after a career as a [[Contrarian investing|contrarian investor]] and wanted to support progress in religious and spiritual knowledge, especially at the intersection of religion and science. He also wanted to fund research on methods to promote and develop [[moral character]], intelligence, and creativity in people, and to promote free markets.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In 2016 ''Inside Philathropy'' called it "the oddest — or most interesting — big foundation around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Tate |title=Templeton Remains the Oddest—or Most Interesting—Big Foundation Around |url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/4/5/templeton-remains-the-oddestor-most-interestingbig-foundatio.html |work=Inside Philanthropy |date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Templeton founded the organization in 1987 and ran it until his death in 2008.  Templeton's son [[John Templeton, Jr.]] ran it until his death in 2015, at which point Templeton, Jr.'s daughter, Heather Templeton Dill, became president.

The foundation administers the annual [[Templeton Prize]] for achievements in the field of spirituality, including those at the intersection of science and religion.  It has an extensive grant-funding program (around $70M per year as of 2011) aimed at supporting notions associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius".  It funded work in [[intelligent design]] in the 1990s but then abandoned that activity after it faced sharp criticism from the mainstream scientific community in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

Many scholars have raised concerns about the biased nature of the awards, research projects and publications backed by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Libby A. Nelson.

According to Lecointre, this type of private funding would be "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research".&lt;ref name=CNRS&gt;{{cite web|title=La Fondation Templeton, les formes présentables du créationnisme philosophique : des initiatives " science et religions " pour dissoudre les limites entre le collectif et l'individuel, entre le public et le privé|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/dossiers/dosevol/decouv/articles/chap1/lecointre5.html|author=Guillaume Lecointre|publisher=[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]]|quote=très lié au fondamentalisme protestant ...

==Leadership==
[[John Templeton]] (29 November 1912 – 8 July 2008) was an American-born British [[investor]], banker, [[Asset management|fund manager]], and philanthropist. In 1954, he entered the [[Mutual fund|mutual fund market]] and created the [[Franklin Templeton Investments|Templeton Growth Fund]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/business/09templeton-cnd.html|title=Sir John M. Templeton, Philanthropist, Rockstar, Dies at 95|date=9 July 2000|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 profile of the foundation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like many of his generation, Templeton was a great believer in progress, learning, initiative and the power of human imagination — not to mention the free-enterprise system that allowed him, a middle-class boy from Winchester, Tennessee, to earn billions of dollars on Wall Street. ... Unlike most of his peers, however, Templeton thought that the principles of progress should also apply to religion. He described himself as "an enthusiastic Christian" — but was also open to learning from Hinduism, Islam and other religious traditions. Why, he wondered, couldn't religious ideas be open to the type of constructive competition that had produced so many advances in science and the free market?.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were the values he sought to promote first through the [[Templeton Prize]] which he started in 1972 and then through the foundation, which he founded in 1987 and ran until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

[[John M. Templeton, Jr.]] worked as a pediatric surgeon; he was chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1995 when he stopped practicing medicine and joined the foundation. He took over the leadership when his father died. He was an [[evangelical Christian]] and supported various [[American conservatism|American conservative]] causes.&lt;ref name=NYT2015&gt;{{cite news |title=John M.

Heather Templeton Dill, the daughter of John Templeton, Jr., became president in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People in the News (8/02/15): Appointments and Promotions|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/people-in-the-news-8-02-15-appointments-and-promotions|newspaper=Philanthropy News Digest|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endowment==
As of 2011, the foundation had an endowment of around $2.1 billion.  Around $500 million of that was a bequest from John Templeton when he died in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Prizes==
{{main|Templeton Prize}}
The Templeton Prize was established by [[John Templeton]] and he administered the prize until the foundation was established in 1987, which took it over.&lt;ref name=Nature2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=M. Mitchell |title=Religion: Faith in science |journal=Nature |date=17 February 2011 |volume=470 |issue=7334 |pages=323–325 |doi=10.1038/470323a}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11745591 |work = The Economist| title= Obituary – John Templeton | accessdate=July 2, 2009|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early prizes were given solely to people who had made great achievements in the field of religion; Mother Teresa received the inaugural award in 1973.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the 1980's Templeton began considering the intersection of science and religion, and after he appointed to scientists to the judging panel, scientists who worked at the intersection began receiving it; [[Alister Hardy]] was the first, in 1987.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Funding==
Templeton believed in capitalism and in competition in all things.  Around 40% of grants are given in fields associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius", and also across all religions, since Templeton believed progress in the field of spirituality could come from anywhere.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The field of grants was broadened in the 1980s to include scientific fields like neuroscience, psychology, and cosmology, that could be seen as being at the intersection of science and religion.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  In the 1990s the foundation funded people and organizations in the field of [[intelligent design]]; the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the late 2000s, in the aftermath of its public shaming and loss of credibility among mainstream scientists, the foundation changed its grant topics to reduce the emphasis on religion and increase the emphasis on science and explicitly discouraged intelligent design proposals on its grant-application website.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The top ten grants as of 2011 were:&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;
# Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology ($10,500,000)
# Foundational Questions in Physics and Cosmology ($8,812,078)
# The SEVEN Fund: Enterprise Based Solutions to Poverty ($8,742,911)
# Establishing an Institute for Research on Unlimited Love ($8,210,000)
# The Purpose Prize for Social Innovators Over the Age of 60 ($8,148,322)
# Templeton–Cambridge Journalism Fellowships and Seminars in Science and Religion ($6,187,971)
# Accelerating Progress at the Interface of Positive Psychology and Neuroscience ($5,816,793)
# AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion ($5,351,707)
# Promoting a Culture of Generosity, Part I: Feature Film ($5,000,000)
# Promoting a Culture of Generosity, Part II: The Philanthropy Channel ($5,000,000)

===American conservatism===

Like all [[501(c)(3)]] organizations, the Templeton Foundation is prohibited from engaging directly in political activity. However, a number of journalists have highlighted connections with conservative causes. A 1997 article in ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' said the Templeton Foundation had given a significant amount of financial support to groups, causes and individuals considered [[American conservatism|conservative]], including gifts to [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Walter E. Williams]], [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] and [[Mary Lefkowitz]], and referred to John Templeton, Jr., as a "conservative sugar daddy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1822/ |title=God's Venture Capitalist |publisher=Slate.com |date=1997-06-08 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also has a history of supporting the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank, as well as projects at major research centers and universities that explore themes related to [[free market economics]], such as [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]]'s [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy|Instituto Libertad Y Democracia]] and the [[X Prize Foundation]].

In a 2007 article in ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] drew attention to the Foundation's president John M. Templeton Jr. funding of the conservative group [[Freedom's Watch]], and referred to the Foundation as a "right wing venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/john-templetons-universe |title=John Templeton's Universe |publisher=The Nation |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela Thompson of the Templeton Foundation, responding to Ehrenreich's allegations, asserted that "the Foundation is, and always has been, run in accordance with the wishes of Sir John Templeton Sr, who laid very strict criteria for its mission and approach", that it is "a non-political entity with no religious bias" and it "is totally independent of any other organisation and therefore neither endorses, nor contributes to political candidates, campaigns, or movements of any kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right's Academic Universe|url=http://ehrenreich.blogs.com/barbaras_blog/2007/10/the-rights-acad.html|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change denial===

In 2013 it was highlighted that the Templeton Foundation has been funding the [[climate change denial]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacPherson|first=Diana|date=26 December 2013|title=Templeton funds climate-change denialist groups|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/templeton-funds-climate-change-denialist-groups/|website=Why Evolution is True}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===

In the 1990s organizations funded by the foundation gave grants for writing books to [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] and to [[William Dembski]] who are proponents of [[intelligent design]] and who both joined the [[Discovery Institute]].&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dembski |first1=William A. |title=Being as Communion: A Metaphysics of Information |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317175445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wYHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also gave money directly to the Discovery Institute which in turn passed it through to Baylor University, which used the funds to support Dembski's salary at the short-lived [[Michael Polanyi Center]] at Baylor,&lt;ref name=Trojan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Gross |first2=Paul R. |title=Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195319736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mMSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gross |first1=Barbara |title=The Wedge at Work |url=https://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/wedge-at-work |work=NCSE |date=3 December 2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a major step forward in the Discovery Institute's [[wedge strategy]], in that it established a beachhead for intelligent design within a major US university.&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork/&gt; [[Bruce L. Gordon]], another intelligent design proponent, was associate director of the center, and the foundation continued to fund his projects at Baylor after the center was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final In Series Of Science And Faith Lectures To Be Held April 22–23 |url=https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7161 |work=Media Communications {{!}} Baylor University |date=19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other grants supported a conference around 2000 that put proponents of intelligent design on an equal footing with scientists.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

In 2005 the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the widely discussed [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  The foundation, through Charles L. Harper Jr., its senior vice president for research, disputed that characterization, saying that while the foundation had initially been sympathetic to intelligent design, it had since grown disillusioned.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodstein |first1=Laurie |title=Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/intelligent-design-might-be-meeting-its-maker.html |work=New York Times |date=December 4, 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''BusinessWeek'' that the foundation had become one of the "principal critics" of the intelligent design movement and funded projects that challenged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_48/b3961617.htm |title=Bloomberg Business |publisher=Businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told the ''New York Times'': "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

A 2007 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the foundation as having "drawn criticism for its early support of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Iritani |first1=Evelyn |title=Testing the role of trust and values in financial decisions |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/business/fi-values21 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Discovery Institute accused the foundation of blocking its involvement in ''[[Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories]]'', a Vatican-backed, Templeton-funded conference in Rome. On the lack of involvement of any speakers supporting intelligent design, the conference director Rev. Marc Leclerc said, "We think that it's not a scientific perspective, nor a theological or philosophical one ... This makes a dialogue difficult, maybe impossible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/03/vaticanbacked_rome_conference.html |title=Vatican-backed Rome conference on evolution snubs intelligent-design and creationist groups |publisher=cleveland.com |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and medicine ===

[[Harold Koenig]], [[Dale Mathews]], David Larson, [[Jeffrey Levin]], [[Herbert Benson]] and [[Michael McCullough (psychologist)|Michael McCullogh]] are scholars to whom Templeton have provided funds to "report the positive relations" between [[Religion and health|religion and medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blindfaithunholy00sloa|title=Blind faith : the unholy alliance of religion and medicine|last=Sloan|first=Richard P.|date=2006|publisher=New York : St. Martin's Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{pov section|date=November 2018}}
===Critiques from the French National Center for Scientific Research===
Giullaume Lecointre of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) has been scathingly critical of the Templeton Foundation, calling its type of private founding "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research", as the French Center considers it aligned to fundamentalist Protestantism, creationism, and aimed at the dissolution of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the collective and public [[empirical knowledge|empirical]] enquiry and the individual and private [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] convictions.&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;

{{quote|''... Mais ce choix ne saurait en rien constituer un projet collectif de connaissance objective. Les connaissances empiriques, universellement testables, constituent la partie de nos savoirs qui unissent les hommes, et c'est pour cela qu'elles sont politiquement publiques. Les options métaphysiques restent personnelles et politiquement privées car elles peuvent diviser les hommes et donc devenir dans le champ politique une source d'oppression.''&lt;br&gt; ... But this choice [the promotion of individual metaphysical opinions] will not be able at all to constitute a collective project of objective knowledge. Empirical knowledge, universally testable, forms the part of our knowledge which unites humanity, and it is for this reason politically public. Metaphysical opinions remain personal and politically private since they can divide humanity and thus become, within the political field, a source of oppression.|CNRS&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;}}

===Critiques from individual scholars===
The Foundation's views on the connections between religious and scientific inquiry and their ability to provide significant grants for scientific research has led to a polarising debate within the scientific community.

====Chris Mooney====
Science journalist Chris Mooney, an atheist and author of ''The Republican War on Science'', received a 2010 Templeton-Cambridge Journalism Fellowship, enabling him to join other journalists for a three-week lecture program on science and religion at Cambridge University. In a 2010 article on his ''Discover'' magazine blog, Mooney wrote, "I can honestly say that I have found the lectures and presentations that we've heard here to be serious and stimulating. The same goes for the discussions that have followed them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/07/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-i/#more-8792|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part I|website=Doscover|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Horgan, a 2005 Templeton-Cambridge fellow then working as a freelance science journalist, wrote in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' that he had enjoyed his fellowship, but felt guilty that by taking money from the Templeton Foundation, he had contributed to the mingling of science with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhorgan.org/the_templeton_foundation__a_skeptic_s_take_52371.htm|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|publisher=John Horgan|date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 2010 article, Mooney took issue with Horgan's point, calling the idea that the fellowship was a "Trojan horse" for religion "pretty untenable". Templeton critics Richard Dawkins, [[A. C. Grayling]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] declined to answer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part II|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/10/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-ii/#.VJiK_sAKA|website=Doscover|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Templeton-Cambridge fellow's interview requests, saying that they did not want to lend credibility to the science and religion journalism program. Mooney rejected this approach, writing, "You can't both denounce the fellowship for being intellectually tilted and also boycott it, thereby refusing to help lend it more of the balance you claim it needs". Grayling and Dennett answered this criticism as follows:

{{quote|... I disapprove of the Templeton Foundation's attempt to tie theologians to the coat tails of scientists and philosophers who actually do have expertise on this topic [that materialism is in Dennett's opinion not an obstacle to an ethical life].

Many years ago I made the mistake of participating, with some very good scientists, in a conference that pitted us against astrologers and other new age fakes. I learned to my dismay that even though we thoroughly dismantled the opposition, many in the audience ended up, paradoxically, with an increased esteem for astrologers! As one person explained to me "I figured that if you scientists were willing to work this hard to refute it, there must be something to it!" Isn't it obvious to you that the Templeton Foundation is eager to create the very same response in its readers?

{{quote|I cannot agree with the Templeton Foundation's project of trying to make religion respectable by conflating it with science; this is like mixing astrology with astronomy or voodoo with medical research, and I disapprove of Templeton's use of its great wealth to bribe compliance with this project. Templeton is to all intents and purposes a propaganda organisation for religious outlooks; it should honestly say so and equally honestly devote its money to prop up the antique superstitions it favours, and not pretend that questions of religion are of the same kind and on the same level as those of science—by which means it persistently seeks to muddy the waters and keep religion credible in lay eyes. It is for this reason I don't take part in Templeton-associated matters.|[[A.C. Grayling]]&lt;ref name="whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com"/&gt;}}

====Donald Wiebe====
Donald Wiebe, scholar of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]], criticized the Templeton Foundation in a 2009 article entitled ''Religious Biases in Funding Religious Studies Research?''. According to him, the Templeton Foundation supports Christian bias in the field of religious studies, by deliberately imposing constraints to steer the results of the research.&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;

{{quote|... A cursory review of these projects suggested to me that the religious (perhaps, speaking liberally, Christian) objectives of the Templeton Foundation were sufficiently problematic to warrant critical public scrutiny of their support for Religious Studies research. It seems to me that obtaining a grant from the Foundation involves constraints that impose a religious bias on the research they fund. As I see it, the Foundation seeks, whether directly or indirectly, to transform genuinely scientific research agendas into religious ones ...&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;}}

====Jerry Coyne====
In 2011, the science journal ''Nature'' took note of the ongoing controversy among scientists over working with Templeton.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; [[Jerry Coyne]], [[University of Chicago]] evolutionary biologist  sees a fundamental impossibility in attempting to reconcile faith with science.

{{quote|"Religion is based on dogma and belief, whereas science is based on doubt and questioning," says Coyne, echoing an argument made by many others. "In religion, faith is a virtue. In science, faith is a vice". The purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to break down that wall, he says—to reconcile the irreconcilable and give religion scholarly legitimacy ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/nature-on-templeton/|title=''Nature'' on Templeton|website=Why Evolution Is True|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A fierce Templeton critic, Coyne told ''Nature'' writer Mitchell Waldrop that the Foundation's purpose is to eliminate the wall between religion and science, and to use science's prestige to validate religion. Other scientists, including Foundation grantees like University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo and Anthony Aguirre, a University of California—Santa Cruz astrophysicist, told ''Nature'' that they have never felt pressured by Templeton to spin their research toward religion-friendly conclusions.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

====John Horgan====
[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], a science journalist and the author of several books, in 2006 wrote an article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (reprinted in ''Edge'') of his "misgivings about the foundation's agenda of reconciling religion and science". He said that a conference he attended favored scientists who "offered a perspective clearly skewed in favor of religion and Christianity", and says that:

{{quote|One Templeton official made what I felt were inappropriate remarks about the foundation's expectations of us fellows. She told us that the meeting cost more than $1-million, and in return the foundation wanted us to publish articles touching on science and religion.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/horgan06/horgan06_index.html|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|last=Horgan|first=John|date=4 May 2006|website=Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Horgan fears recipients of large grants from the Templeton Foundation sometimes write what the Foundation wants rather than what they believe.

{{quote|Several areligious scientists told me privately that they did not want to challenge the beliefs of religious speakers for fear of offending them and the Templeton hosts.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"/&gt;}}

====Nathan Schneider====
In 2010, journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] published a lengthy investigative article about the Templeton Foundation, entitled ''God, Science and Philanthropy'', in ''[[The Nation]]''. In the article, he aired familiar complaints about the Foundation, but observed that many of its critics and grantees alike failed to appreciate "the breadth of the foundation's activities, much less the quixotic vision of its founder, John Templeton". Schneider observed: "At worst, Templeton could be called heterodox and naïve; at best, his was a mind more open than most, reflective of the most inventive and combinatorial strains of American religious thought, eager to radically reinterpret ancient wisdom and bring it up to speed with some version from the present."&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/god-science-and-philanthropy?page=full|title=God, Science and Philanthropy|newspaper=The Nation|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the foundation, in Schneider's view, "has associated itself with political and religious forces that cause it to be perceived as threatening the integrity of science and protecting the religious status quo," these alliances meant the foundation "is also better positioned than most to foster a conservatism—and a culture generally—that holds the old habits of religions and business responsible to good evidence, while helping scientists better speak to people's deepest concerns".&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt;

====Paul Davies====
Professor [[Paul Davies]], physicist and member of the Foundation's Board of Trustees, gave a defense of the Foundation's role in the scientific community in the Times Higher Education Supplement in March 2005. Responding to concerns about the funding of such research by religious organisations that might have a hidden agenda and in particular the Templeton Foundation, Davies said:

{{quote|If the foundation were indeed a religious organisation with its own specific doctrine, [the] objections would have substance. In fact, it is nothing of the sort. The benefactor, Sir John Templeton, bemoans the way that religious leaders often claim to have all the answers. Imagine, he says, consulting a doctor about an ailment, only to find him reaching for a volume of Hippocrates.  Yet priests rely on ancient scriptures to deliver spiritual guidance. Sir John wants to address the big questions of existence with humility and open-mindedness, adopting the model of scientific research in place of religious dogma. "How little we know!" is his favourite aphorism. It is a radical message, as far from religious fundamentalism as it is possible to get.

... recurring research themes supported by the foundation are the search for extra-solar planets, the properties of liquid water, the evolution of primate behaviour, emergent properties of complex systems, the foundations of quantum mechanics and the biological and social bases for forgiveness in areas of human conflict. In none of these projects is anything like a preferred religious position encouraged or an obligation imposed to support any religious group.

Britain is a post-religious society. Yet ordinary men and women still yearn for some sort of deeper meaning to their lives.  Can science point the way? Science has traditionally been regarded as dehumanising and alienating, trivialising the significance of humans and celebrating the pointlessness of existence. But many scientists, atheists included, see it differently. They experience what Einstein called "a cosmic religious feeling" when reflecting on the majesty of the cosmos and the extraordinary elegance and ingenuity of its mathematical laws.

Science cannot and should not be a substitute for religion. But I see nothing sinister or unprofessional about scientists working with open-minded theologians to explore how science might be a source of inspiration rather than demoralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeking inspiration in science|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/seeking-inspiration-in-science/194642.article|date=11 March 2005|website=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Peter Woit====
[[Peter Woit]], a mathematical physicist at [[Columbia University]], occasionally writes about his misgivings with the foundation on his blog (which is hosted by Columbia University). Woit feels it is unfortunate that Templeton's money is used to influence scientific research towards a convergence between science and religion.

In June 2005, Woit wrote:

{{quote|Look not at what the Templeton people say (which is relatively innocuous), but at what they do. They explicitly refuse to support serious science, and instead fund an incredible array of attempts to inject religion into scientific practice. ... Instead they are heavily funding the one part of the field that most people consider dangerous pseudo-science and a serious threat to the whole concept of what it means to do science.&lt;ref name=Woit1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=205|title=Multiverse, String Theory and Templeton|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=12 June 2005|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2007, he gave this more qualified, but still largely critical, assessment of the Foundation following attendance at a Templeton sponsored seminar:
 
{{quote|The symposium I attended had not a trace of involvement of religion in it, and it seems that Templeton is careful to keep this out of some of the things that it funds as pure science ... They appear to have a serious commitment to the idea of funding things in physics that can be considered "foundational". People working in some such areas often are considered out of the physics mainstream and so find it hard to get their research funded. For them, Templeton is in many ways a uniquely promising funding source.

... However, they unambiguously are devoted to trying to bring science and religion together, and that's my main problem with them. ... I remain concerned though about the significance for physics of this large new source of funding, out of scale with other such private sources, and with an agenda that seems to me to have a dangerous component to it.&lt;ref name=Woit2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=606|title=Deep Beauty|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=6 October 2007|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nonetheless, Woit's impression is that the Foundation is careful to keep conservative politics out of its activities and he does state that "their encouragement of religion seems to be of a very ecumenical nature".&lt;ref name=Woit2/&gt;

On 16 March 2012, in an article entitled ''Templeton Millions'', Woit expressed a more scathing critique of the Templeton Foundation:

{{quote|... I think what is going on here is very dangerous. The Templeton Foundation's agenda is not the advancement of science, it is the advancement of a particular religious point of view about what science is and how it should be done. They are very cleverly putting large sums of money into backing theology and pseudo-scientific research at the most prestigious academic institutions in the world. One reason that these places are happily taking the money is because public funding is drying up. The organization is extremely wealthy, and now led by Templeton's son, who when he isn't spending his father's money on this is spending it on promoting Rick Santorum's political career or other far-right causes.&lt;ref name=Woit3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4478&amp;cpage=1|title=Templeton Millions|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=16 March 2012|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Woit wrote that the Templeton Foundation that year funded a project led by the astronomer Donald York of the [[University of Chicago]] because he is an [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]], quoting a statement of the Foundation itself.&lt;ref name=Woit3/&gt;

====PZ Myers====
On 7 May 2009, [[PZ Myers]], biologist at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]], wrote:

{{quote|They have an agenda, and it is one of the most corrupting and untrustworthy causes of all, religion. They already know the answer, and they only want to pay for results that can be interpreted to bolster their unsupportable claims. Even if they are not asking that anyone fake evidence, we know that any line of inquiry that leads away from their desired answer will be abandoned, even if it is leading to the right answer. They are antithetical to good science. ... And, boy are they loaded, with a massive endowment and the willingness to throw large sums of money around. Scarily huge sums — the kind of money that will tempt even the most principled scientist to compromise a little bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PZ Myers|url=https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/07/the-templeton-conundrum/#more://|title=The Templeton condrum|website=Freethought Blogs – Pharyngula|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Richard Dawkins====
In his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] (an [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]) repeatedly criticizes the Templeton Foundation, referring to the Templeton Prize as "a very large sum of money given ... usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion". Concerning the conference that he and John Horgan attended, and to John Horgan's resulting article, Dawkins comments, "If I understand Horgan's point, it is that Templeton's money corrupts science".&lt;ref name='GodDelusion'&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Black Swan|year=2006|location=UK|isbn=9780552773317|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Templeton funded a study specifically targeting Richard Dawkins, authored by a team led by the Templeton-funded sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]], of the [[Rice University]]. Out of a total number of interviewed scientists, the authors selected those who didn't like Dawkins, and compiled an entire publication based on their opinion. In the article Dawkins is variously called "Mr. Anti-God Europe", "extremely arrogant" and "overly aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/in-defense-of-richard-dawkins-elaine-ecklund-and-team-write-a-pointless-templeton-funded-paper-saying-that-surveyed-scientists-feel-that-dawkins-misrepresents-science/|title=In defense of Richard Dawkins: Elaine Ecklund and team write a pointless, Templeton-funded paper saying that Dawkins "misrepresents science"|website=Why Evolution is True|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sean M. Carroll====
[[Sean M. Carroll]], a [[cosmologist]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], wrote, in describing his self-recusal from a conference he discovered was funded by the Foundation, that "the entire purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to blur the line between straightforward science and explicitly religious activity, making it seem like the two enterprises are part of one big undertaking. It's all about appearances". But he also said, "I appreciate that the Templeton Foundation is actually, in its own way, quite pro-science, and is not nearly as objectionable as the anti-scientific crackpots at the [[Discovery Institute]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Sean|url=http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#111387591806156772|title=Purity of essence|date=18 April 2005|website=Preposterous Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunny Bains====
Sunny Bains of [[University College London]] Faculty of Engineering Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Sunny Bains Biography|url=http://www.sunnybains.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that there is:

{{quote|... evidence of cronyism (especially in the awarding in those million-dollar-plus Templeton prizes), a misleading attempt to move away from using religious language (without changing the religious agenda), the funding of right-wing anti-science groups, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bains|first=Sunny|title=Keeping an eye on the John Templeton Foundation|date=6 April 2011|url=https://www.absw.org.uk/news-and-events/news/keeping-an-eye-on-the-john-templeton-foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bains feels the Templeton Foundation "blur the line between science and religion". Bains' claims have been disputed by Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenau|first=Josh|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|title=How bad is the Templeton Foundation? – Thoughts from Kansas|publisher=Scienceblogs.com|date=5 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502174515/http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|archivedate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.

'''Joseph Francis Petrič''' (born October 8, 1952) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] concert [[accordionist]], musicologist, teacher, and author.

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]] and raised in [[Acton, Ontario|Acton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Okum|first= Leanne|date= May 26, 1992|title= Joseph Petric comes home with his Academy Players|url= http://news.haltonhills.halinet.on.ca/106744/page/8|work= Acton Tanner|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of the political diaspora that left [[Slovenija]] in 1945.  Taken by his father to his first accordion lesson at age five, he studied with local teachers until 1968, when he enrolled at Toronto’s [[Royal Conservatory of Music]]. In 1975 he completed his [[Bachelor of Music]] at [[Queen’s University]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. That same year, he moved to [[Toronto]] and completed his master's degree in Musicology in 1977. Influenced by the [[Toronto]] visit of Swiss accordionist Hugo Noth in 1975, Petric studied at the [[:de:Hochschule für Musik Trossingen|Hochschule für Musik]] in [[Trossingen]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gervasoni|first= Pierre|date= 1986|title= L’Accordéon : Instrument du XXe siécle|trans-title= The Accordion: Instrument of the 20th Century|page= 72|language= French|location= Paris|publisher= Éditions Mazo|isbn=2-95015070-5|oclc=869159905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
In October 1979, Petric made his Canadian debut with Toronto’s Arraymusic Ensemble, and became the first accordionist to win the CBC National Radio Auditions, which launched his career on both the English and French radio services of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Macerollo|first= Joseph|date= 1980|title= Accordion Resource Manual|url= |location= Willowdale|publisher= Avondale Press|page= 20|isbn= 0-9690452-8-X|ol= 3911334M}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his international career in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Kennedy Centre]] in 1986 and in [[London]] at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in 1992.

Throughout the 1980s, his artistic activity included commissioning, performing and recording,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gervasoni|first= Pierre|date= 1988|title= Un Instrument insolite de l’avant-garde canadienne : L’Accordéon|trans-title= The Accordion: Insolent instrument of the Canadian avant-garde|url= |language= French|journal= Boréales : Revue du Centre de recherches inter-nordiques|publisher= Centre de recherches inter-nordiques|location= [[Suresnes]]|volume= |issue= 36-37|pages= 93–97|issn= 0395-3998}}&lt;/ref&gt; with invitations from [[Serge Garant]] and [[SMCQ|Montreal’s SMCQ ensemble]], ACREQ, the string quartets [[Alcan]] and [[St. Germain (musician)|St. Germain]], [[Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne|the NEM Ensemble]], and Pentaèdre; he received invitations to the McGill, [[Domaine Forget]], and Bic St. Fabien festivals. He was the artistic director of The Big Squeeze accordion festival in [[Toronto]] in 1991, as well as the Virtuosi Series for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] at the Glenn Gould Hall in 1993. In 1998, he turned his attention to the research of period performance practices and instrument building, with the assistance of a [[Canada Council|Canada Council Senior Artist’s Grant]], working with period keyboard artists [[Colin Tilney]] and [[Boyd McDonald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.thewholenote.com/index.php/booksrecords2/booksrecords2-2/12929-a-victorian-romance-music-for-the-english-concertina-joseph-petric-boyd-mcdonald|title=A Victorian Romance - Music for the English Concertina - Joseph Petric; Boyd McDonald|last=Kiik|first=Tiina|journal=The Whole Note|volume= 17|issue= 2|page= 63|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he became the artistic director for the Carte Blanche Series in Montreal for the [[Radio Canada|Société Radio Canada]], and [[Quebec City]] in 2003.

His postmodern approaches attracted the marketing support of four international management companies: MGAM in [[Toronto]], NCCP in [[London]], Sarah Turner Communications in [[Paris]], and Columbia Artists in [[New York City]]; as well as financial support of the Koussevitsky Foundation, CBC, and the Canada Council for the Arts. He enjoyed special relationships with Bob Aitken’s New Music Concerts in Toronto, the [[SMCQ|Societe Contemporaine de Quebec]] in [[Montreal]], the [[Canadian Electronic Ensemble]], and composer [[Witold Lutoslawski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Pigula|first=Szymon|title=Rola akordeonu i jego znaczenie we współczesnej literaturze kameralnej na podstawie wybranych przykładów|date=2011|degree=|publisher=[[Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music]], [[Katowice]]|url=|doi=|language=Polish|trans-title=The role of the accordion and its importance in contemporary chamber music literature, based on selected examples|type=|chapter=|docket=|oclc=978205013|pages=12-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A steady stream of international tours followed, with up to 80 concerts a year, and international recordings for [[CBC Radio|CBC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|SRC]], [[BBC Radio 3]], and [[PBS radio|PBS]] (USA). His numerous collaborations include: the Petric-Forget Duo, Pentaèdre, Canada’s Penderecki Quartet, Duo Contempera, the Trio Diomira, [[Pauline Oliveros]], and the ensembles Erosonic and Bellows and Brass.

Other notable performances include: premiere performance and recording of [[Peter Paul Koprowski]]'s Accordion Concerto with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]] (1996); ''[[Sequenza|Berio Sequenza]]'' at [[Tanglewood Music Center|Tanglewood’s Seiji Ozawa Hall]], with members of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] (2000); the sock puppet opera, ''The Perfect Cake'', by [[Alain Trudel]]; [[Linda Bouchard]]'s multi-disciplinary work ''Murderous Little World'' with Bellows and Brass; the [[:de:Schubertiade Vorarlberg|Hohenems Schubertiade]] with tenor [[Christoph Pregardien]], and the Montreal's Pentaèdre in Normand Forget's chamber version of ''[[Winterreise|Die Winterreise]]''(2009); the [[Israeli Opera|Israeli Opera Tel Aviv]] (2011), and the [[Berlin Philharmonic|Berlin Philharmonic Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/466690113377624/|title=KAMMERMUSIK: CHRISTOPH PRÉGARDIEN, Tenor CHRISTINE SCHÄFER, Sopran|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013).

'''Khitan''' ({{lang-ar|ختان}}) or '''Khatna''' ({{lang-ar|ختنة}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]]&lt;ref name="Ibn Manẓūr 1311 1102"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ibn Manẓūr |first= Muḥammad ibn Mukarram |date= 1311 |title= Lisan Al-Arab |url= |location= Qumm, Iran |publisher= |page= 1102 |isbn= 9953131953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane 1863 703"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lane |first= Edward William |date= 1863 |title= Arabic-English Lexicon |url= |location= London |publisher= Willams &amp; Norgate |page= 703 |isbn= 8120601076}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out as an [[Islamic culture]] by Muslims.

Islamic male circumcision is analogous but not identical to [[Brit milah|Jewish circumcision]]. Islam is currently the largest single religious group in which the practice is widespread,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; although circumcision is not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] itself but is mentioned in a [[hadith]] and the [[sunnah]].

==Religious sources==
[[File:Circumcision central Asia2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Circumcision]] being performed in central Asia (probably [[Turkestan]]), c. 1865–1872.  Restored [[albumen print]].]]
The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. In the time of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], circumcision of men was carried out by most pagan [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] and [[female circumcision]] by some, and male circumcision by Jews for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;W. La Barre, The Ghost Dance, London, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been attested by [[Al-Jahiz]],&lt;ref&gt;Volume II of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Works of Flavius Josephus, translated by W. Whiston, 2 vols., London, 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some traditions, Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather Abd-al-Muttalib circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions – Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts report that [[Heraclius]], Emperor of Byzantium, had referred to Muhammad as the "leader of the circumcised people".&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, vol. 1, book 1, no. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). Abu Hurayra, a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, "Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" (reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]). So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith – Book of Dress – Sahih al-Bukhari – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted "The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith – The Book of Purification – Sahih Muslim – Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=sunnah.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the different hadiths do not agree on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not.

Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] supposedly quotes Muhammad as saying that "[[ghusl|ablution]] becomes necessary if the two circumcised members touch".&lt;ref&gt;Malik ibn Anas, Ketab al-mowatta, Volume I, pages 45-47, traditions 70-75. ed. M.F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Kitab Sunan, ed. M. F. Abd-al-Baqi, Cairo, 1972, Page 199 Volume I&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Muhammad is reported to have once advised a female circumciser not to cut off the entire clitoris during female circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Page 28 of Volume VII of al-Hayawan by Jahiz, ed. A. M. Harun, 7 vols., Cairo, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some ''hadith'', Muhammad supposedly circumcised his grandsons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], on the seventh day after their birth.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Amili, Muhammad Ibn Hasan Al-Hur. Wasa'il al-shi'ah ila tahsil masa'il al-shariah. Vol 15. Tehran, Al-Maktabah al-Islamiyyah, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim also quote from Muhammad that Prophet Abraham performed his own circumcision at the age of eighty.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari Hadith No. 575, and Muslim's anthology of authentic hadith, IV, item 2370.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported by [[Abu Dawud]] and [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] that Muhammad stated that circumcision was a "law for men and a preservation of honor for women".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75; Abu Dawud, Adab 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was introduced to many lands for the first time through Islam itself following the Muslim conquests under the [[Rashidun]], who were the companions and contemporaries of Muhammad. An example are the [[Persian people|Persians]] who did not practice circumcision before the advent of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Iranica, Circumcision&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Islamic converts such as [[Afshin (Caliphate General)|Afshin]] were found guilty in trials of remaining uncircumcised;&lt;ref&gt;Page 766 of the Volume II of Al-Basaer wa al-Dhakha'ir, Abu Hayyan Tawhidi, Kaylānī, Damascus, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; this further indicates that the practice was deemed compulsory by the early Muslims.

===Sunni Islam===
Amongst ''[[Ulema]]'' (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). [[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi‘i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shia Islam ===
Most Shia traditions regard the practice as obligatory. They rely on sayings that come from classical Shia authors.&lt;ref&gt;Book 90 of Hilyat ul-muttaqeen&lt;/ref&gt; In one narration Muhammad was asked if an uncircumcised man could go to pilgrimage. He answered "not as long as he is not circumcised". They quote [[Ali]] as saying: "If a man becomes Muslim, he must submit to circumcision even if he is 80 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:35&lt;/ref&gt; Another narration from [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Al-Sadiq]] says: "Circumcise your sons when they are seven days old as it is cleaner (athar) and the flesh grows faster and because the earth hates the urine of the uncircumcised."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kalini, Abu-Ja'afar Muhammad Ibn-Yaqub. Al-furu'min al-kafi. Vol. 6 Tehran: Dar al-kutub al-islamiyyah. 1981:34&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that the urine of the uncircumcised is impure, while if one prays with unclean genitals their prayer may not be considered as acceptable, even of those who have been circumcised, meaning that it may have to be repeated again at a time when the believer has purified themselves and removed the impurity. Another hadith of Muhammad states: "the earth cries out to God in anguish because of the urine of the uncircumcised", and that "the earth becomes defiled from the urine of the uncircumcised for forty days".&lt;ref&gt;DS Hellsten. Male and Female Circumcision: Medical, Legal and Ethical Considerations in Pediatric Practice. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quranists===
Most [[Qur'an alone|Quranists]] claim circumcision is [[haram]], arguing that Quran {{Cite quran|4|119|s=ns|b=n}} forbids altering one's body, and {{Cite quran|95|4|s=ns|b=n}} says man was created perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quranicpath.com/misconceptions/circumcision.html |title=Circumcision - Does the Quran Approve it? - Genital Mutilation &amp;#124; ختان &amp;#124; Khitan &amp;#124; Islam &amp;#124; Sunnah &amp;#124; Hadith &amp;#124; Khatna &amp;#124; Musolmani &amp;#124; Sunat &amp;#124; Sirkumsisi &amp;#124; Khatan &amp;#124; Tuli &amp;#124; Tule &amp;#124; Pagtutuli &amp;#124; Sunatan &amp;#124; Sünnet &amp;#124; Urkwtha &amp;#124; Tahara &amp;#124; Touhur &amp;#124; طهارة &amp;#124; طهور |publisher=QuranicPath |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmonotheists.com/tag/revisionist-muslim/ |title=Revisionist Muslim « For All Monotheists |publisher=Allmonotheists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ljZZ9ZvD_kQC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=circumcision+islam+alter+perfect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GyWEmzPIGi&amp;sig=6eNHUNrQsiDL0LM3_uECSIGNuFI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nrIeTpKLHIaHhQe5_OysAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Male and female circumcision, medical, legal, and ethical considerations] George C.

==Time for circumcision==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Java optocht bij een besnijdenisfeest links vooraan stokpaarden TMnr 60002834.jpg|thumb|Traditional procession after circumcision of a child in [[Dutch East Indies]], 1915–1918.]]
Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

==Procedure==
Whereas Jewish circumcision is closely bound by ritual timing and tradition, in Islam there is no fixed age for circumcision. The age when boys get circumcised, and the procedures used, tend to change across cultures, families, and time. In some Muslim-majority countries, circumcision is performed on Muslim boys after they have learned to recite the whole Qur'an from start to finish.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In [[Malaysia]] and other regions, the boy usually undergoes the operation between the ages of ten and twelve, and is thus a [[Rite of passage|puberty rite]], serving to introduce him into the new status of an adult.&lt;ref name="circlist1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |title=Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision&amp;mdash;Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of This Faith |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure is sometimes semi-public, accompanied with music, special foods, and much festivity.&lt;ref name="circlist" /&gt;

There is no equivalent of a Jewish [[mohel]] in Islam. Circumcisions are usually carried out in a clinic or hospital. The circumciser is not required to be a Muslim.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The position of the scar is usually neither fully "low" nor fully "high", and the skin left is rather loose. However, due to a relatively secular approach to circumcision in the Muslim world, the "styles" of the Islamic circumcision vary on every individual, and change in the light of new medical knowledge.&lt;ref name="circlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |title=Style choices in relation to Religious Beliefs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515075416/http://www.circlist.com/styles/page3.html |archivedate=2014-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, instead of being carried out in hospitals, they would be carried out in local clinics and terraces. The circumciser would generally scream "dekh kabootar", translating into "look at the pigeons" in Urdu, to distract the patient and then circumcise the individual.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Celebrations==
In Indonesia, after a child is circumcised, there is a feast called [[Perayaan Sunatan]], but some ulemas in Indonesia say this is [[bid‘ah]] whereas most of them say it is not. In Turkey also widely celebrated and called "Sunnet Toreni" "Sunnet mevludu".

==Female genital mutilation==
''[[Khafḍ]]'', or ''k̲h̲ifāḍ'', refers to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="khitān" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh, Sami A., To Mutilate in the Name of Jehova or Allah, Legitimization of Male and Female Circumcision, Middle East Research Associates, Paper No. 21, 1994; see page 6-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulyonline.brill.nl/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khafd-SIM_4132 K̲h̲afḍ], Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is sometimes  referred to as ''khitan''.{{efn|Asmani and Abdi ([[USAID]], 2008): "Proponents of FGM/C have translated the Arabic word ''khitaan'', which appears in several religious texts, to refer to both male circumcision and FGM/C. In reality, however, the word only describes male circumcision; FGM/C is actually called ''khifaadh''. However, whenever ''khitaan'' appears in a religious text it is used by the proponents to justify an Islamic basis for FGM/C."&lt;ref name=Asmani2008pp3–5&gt;Ibrahim Lethome Asmani, Maryam Sheikh Abdi, [http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/De-linking%20FGM%20from%20Islam%20final%20report.pdf ''De-linking Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting from Islam''], Washington: Frontiers in Reproductive Health, USAID, 2008, 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Van Donze (1994), Islamic Desk Reference (Compiled from Encyclopedia of Islam), {{ISBN|9004097384}}, Brill (Netherlands), p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khitān/&gt; In many communities, ''khafd'' is a rite of passage and refers to excision of the female genital organs.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Hawting (2006), The Development of Islamic Ritual, {{ISBN|978-0860787129}}, page 358-361&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 million women in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are thought to be living with FGM.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf "Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Global Concern"], New York: United Nations Children's Fund, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is a common belief that FGM is a requirement in Islam, the Quran makes no mention of it and the practice is largely condemned by the majority of Muslims. In Africa, FGM is also practiced not just by Muslims from certain cultures but by Christians and animists alike.

The '''Korea Institute of Maritime and Fisheries Technology''', or '''KIMFT''',  is a maritime education and research institute operated by the government of [[South Korea]].  It is based in [[Yeongdang-dong]], [[Nam-gu (Busan)|Nam-gu]], [[Busan]], with an auxiliary campus on [[Yeongdo]] island near [[Busan Port]].  Each campus includes a dormitory for trainees.

The Institute was formed in 1998 from the merger of the Korea Fishing Training Center with the Korea Maritime Training and Research Institute.  The first was established in 1965 as the Korea Deep-sea Training Institute.  In 1978, it became an independent corporation.  The research institute was founded in 1983, attached to [[Pukyong National University]].  The two were merged by an act of the [[National Assembly of South Korea]] passed in 1997.

In addition to its research work, KIMFT offers a range of professional certifications.  These include a certification in [[fish medicine]].

== Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize" ==
{{Main|Netflix Prize}}
In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize,&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation /&gt; "We thought we built the best darn thing ever."&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/31leonhardt.html|title=You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize|date=January 31, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by June 2007, Hastings said the competition is "three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/technology/04netflix.html|title=Netflix Prize Still Awaits a Movie Seer|date=June 4, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three teams – an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory – combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used [[machine learning]] techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&amp;T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throttling of DVDs by mail ==
Netflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as "[[DVD-by-mail#"Throttling"|throttling]]" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215072830/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2006 |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |title='Throttling' angers Netflix heavy renters |agency=Associated Press (Internet Archive) |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix claims that "the large majority of our subscribers are able to receive their movies in about one business day following our shipment of the requested movie from their local distribution center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#how|title=Terms of Use|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all shipments come from the subscriber's local distribution center, and shipments from distant centers are often delayed, as well.

In September 2004, a consumer [[class action lawsuit]], ''Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 Class action suit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205730/http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against Netflix in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The suit alleged [[false advertising]] in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its [[terms of use]] to acknowledge "throttling" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with [[negative option billing|customers being charged accordingly]] unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Netflix|title=Netflix Claim Form Process|url=http://www.netflix.com/Settlement?mqso=60178549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535 California Appellate Courts] Chavez v. Netflix Inc. Appeal Status&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was affirmed on April 21, 2008, with the court stating, "the trial court did not abuse its discretion in approving the amended class action settlement agreement, approving the notice given to class members, or determining the amount of fees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Chavez v. Netflix Inc. |volume= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=Court of California 1st Appellate District |date=April 21, 2008 |url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/disposition.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535&amp;doc_no=A115395 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court approved email notice and an online claims submission process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclpractitioner.com/2008/04/new-class-actio.html |title= New class action objector opinion: Chavez v. Netflix, Inc. |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Kralowec |first=Kimberly A. |date=April 28, 2008 |work=The UCL Practitioner }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130003/solutions_for_digital_annoyances.html |title=Solutions for Digital Annoyance |author=Spring, Tom |date=March 27, 2007 |work=PC World |accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Terms of Use have since been amended with terms that indicate such a suit would not be possible in the future:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#disputes |title=Netflix Terms of Use: Disputes; Governing Law |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. You and Netflix agree that the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and/or the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute between you and Netflix relating in any way to the Netflix service or Web site or these Terms of Use. You and Netflix expressly and irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in these courts. The parties agree that in any such dispute or subsequent legal action, they will only assert claims in an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and that they will not seek or agree to serve as a named representative in a class action or seek relief on behalf of those other than themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Releasing this week ===
The Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, "Releasing This Week" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week.&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netflix.com/AllNewReleases?lnkctr=NavAllNewReleases| title=All DVDs Releasing This Week| publisher=Netflix| accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called "Popular New Releases", does not list newly released DVDs for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2007/12/netflix-removes.html| title=Netflix Removes New Releases Page – Customers Complain |publisher=Hacking Netflix |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of new releases is still active,&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week" /&gt; although there is no menu option that links to the page.

On January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Happy New Year |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/01/happy-new-year.html |publisher=Netflix Community Blog |accessdate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods ==
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit in which it demanded a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], alleging that Blockbuster's [[online DVD rental]] subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first [[cause of action]] alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B. (Santa Cruz, CA), Hunt; Neil Duncan|title=Approach for renting items to customers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second cause of action alleged infringement of Patent No. 6,584,450 (issued June 24, 2003), which covers in less detail the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=6584450|y=2003|m=06|d=24|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B. (Santa Cruz, CA), Hunt; Neil Duncan (Mountain View, CA)|title=Method and apparatus for renting items}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute ended a year later, on June 25, 2007, with both companies declining to disclose the terms of their legal settlement, except for a statement by Blockbuster that it would not have a major impact on its future financial performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/e/070627/bbi8-k.html |title=Form 8-K for BLOCKBUSTER INC |work=Yahoo!

The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2007/06/25/daily54.html Blockbuster to close 282 stores this year – San Francisco Business Times]. Bizjournals.com (June 29, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |title=Blockbuster, Weinsteins sign exclusive deal |work= Video Business |publisher= Reed Business Information |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103065726/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |archivedate= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |title=How The Weinstein Company ruined Home Entertainment |author=Sciretta, Peter |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161945/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Annual Report |url=http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-07-42689 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|6}}, Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including ''[[Unknown (2006 film)|Unknown]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School For Scoundrels]]'' and ''[[Harsh Times]]'', among others. The [[first-sale doctrine]] allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.

=== Removal of social networking feature ===
Beginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of [[social networking]]. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign |title= 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash |first= Cliff |last= Kuang |date= March 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 |title= Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity |first= Tim |last= Conneally |date= March 18, 2010 |publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html |title= New Movie Details Page Rolled Out |date= March 4, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of [[Product Management]], Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.&lt;ref name="fastcompany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html |title= Friends Update |date= March 17, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html |title= Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal |date= March 14, 2010 |publisher=Hacking Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux support ==
Netflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully [[open-source software|open source]] versions of [[Linux]] and similar operating systems.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Google's partially proprietary Android and [[Chrome OS]] platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], although this changed in October 2014.

On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&amp;hc=hp&amp;hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/html5-video-in-ie-11-on-windows-81.html|title=The Netflix Tech Blog: HTML5 Video in IE 11 on Windows 8.1|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com" /&gt; It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.

As of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/ |title=Watch Netflix in Ubuntu today |publisher=Ubuntu |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pclinuxos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/netflix-streaming-comes-to-chrome-for-pclinuxos/|title=Netflix streaming comes to PCLinuxOS » PCLinuxOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of [[Linux Mint]] have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2824623/ubuntu-linux-gets-netflix-without-weird-workarounds.html|title=Netflix comes to Linux via Ubuntu and Chrome|author=Jared Newman|date=October 10, 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party solutions ===

On March 11, 2011, Don Cullen filed a national class action lawsuit&lt;ref name="cullenvnetflix"&gt;[http://www.westonfirm.com/Netflix-Complaint.pdf NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION FILED AGAINST NETFLIX; LAWSUIT ALLEGES POPULAR MOVIE WEBSITE FAILED TO CAPTION STREAMING VIDEO LIBRARY IN VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, MISLED DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CUSTOMERS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812190131/http://www.westonfirm.com/Netflix-Complaint.pdf |date=2011-08-12 }}. Cullen v. Netflix, Inc., Case No. CV 11-1199 (N.D. Cal.). Retrieved January 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; against Netflix alleging that the service failed to [[closed captioning|closed caption]] its streaming video library and had misled deaf and hard of hearing customers. In June 2011, the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] represented by the [[Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund]] (DREDF) filed a lawsuit against Netflix for not providing closed captioning on all of its movies on the "Watch Instantly" service. The group claims Netflix is violating the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] by not providing equal access on entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20072619-38/netflix-sued-by-deaf-group-over-lack-of-subtitles/|title= Netflix sued by deaf group over lack of subtitles|author=Whitney, Lance|date=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2011, the court denied Netflix a motion to dismiss the case.&lt;ref name="nadcasedoc32"&gt;[http://www.nad.org/sites/default/files/2011/November/Court%20Order%20Denying%20MTD%202011%2011%2010.pdf MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS AMENDED COMPLAINT]. United States DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS. Case 3:11-cv-30168-MAP. Document 32. Retrieved December 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, saying the Americans with Disabilities Act applies only to physical spaces, not online.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen v. Netflix, 600 Fed. Appx. 508 (Ct. App. Ninth Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the [[game console]]s, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.&lt;ref name=amara1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[GigaOM]]|last=Roettgers|first=Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are [[derivative work]]s which [[copyright infringement|infringe copyright]] if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.&lt;ref name=amara2&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara operates under [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement [[lawsuit]]s over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.&lt;ref name=amara1 /&gt;

In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' to customers in [[Finland]] with unauthorized subtitles from the [[fansub]] scene.&lt;ref name=tfOct19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in [[cease and desist]] notices, [[notice and take down|takedowns]], and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=tfOct19 /&gt;

On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in ''The Week'', titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Week|title=How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions| date=January 20, 2014| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255618/how-netflix-alienated-and-insulted-its-deaf-subscribers |author=Christian, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with [[described video|audio descriptions]] of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it "terribly laughable PR" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|character]] who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.&lt;ref name=wp-blindsuperhero&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes a blind superhero accessible to blind audiences|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/04/14/netflix-makes-a-blind-superhero-accessible-to-blind-viewers/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-descriptions&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Adding Audio Description Tracks for Visually Impaired, Starting with 'Marvel's Daredevil'|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-adding-audio-description-tracks-for-visually-impaired-starting-with-marvels-daredevil-1201472372/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumvention of geoblocking ==
More than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a [[proxy server]] or [[virtual private network]] (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix [[Geo-blocking|cannot offer in their region]], due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor.&lt;ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock&gt;{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode /&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-riftcourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/09/why-netflix-wont-block-vpn-users |title=Why Netflix won't block VPN users – it has too many of them, Part II |last=Hern |first=Alex |publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn /&gt; As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/13/netflix-canada-vs-us_n_4435459.html|title=Netflix Canada vs. Netflix USA: Why Do We Get The Shaft?|first=Michael|last=Bolen|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked e-mail revealed by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] in 2014, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.&lt;ref name=verge-netflixproxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
=== Price increase lawsuit ===
A lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have "grandfathered" subscription plans with price guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2018, Netflix [[Chief Communications Officer|CCO]] Jonathan Friedland was fired for saying the word [[nigger]] during a company meeting about offensive words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17495364/netflix-pr-chief-jonathan-friedland-fired-n-word-racial-slur|title=Netflix PR chief fired for repeatedly using the n-word|first=Nick|last=Statt|publisher=The Verge|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memo released by Reed Hastings, which stated that he should have used a [[euphemism]], mentioned that Friedland said the word again during a follow-up meeting with [[human resources]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">'''Mark D. Jordan''' is the [[Andrew Mellon]] Professor of Christian Thought at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and Professor of the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. His focus is on [[European philosophy]], [[gender studies]], and [[sexuality]]. Much of his early work related to Catholic teachings of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In recent years, he has more specifically focused on religious doctrine and its relation to [[LGBT]] issues.

In addition to his scholarship and classroom teaching, Jordan has discussed sexual and religious issues to audiences that range from college lectureships to [[National Public Radio]], the ''[[New York Times]]'', and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/10/28/harvard-professor-seeks-gay-term-in-bible/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2002/July/erJuly.22/7_22_02profile.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/23/jordan-hds-professor/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marymount California University''' is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[university]] in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California|Rancho Palos Verdes]], [[California]].  Based in the liberal arts tradition and inspired by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RHSM), the university awards [[associate degree|associate]], [[bachelor's]], and [[graduate degree]]s.&lt;ref name="MCU web site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/academic-programs|title=Academic Program Information - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is [[Higher education accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wascsenior.org/institutions/marymount-california-university|title=Marymount California University - WASC Senior College and University Commission|website=Wascsenior.org|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Marymount California University was established in 1968 by the RHSM as Marymount Palos Verdes College. It was split from the original Marymount College in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]]; this Marymount later merged with St. Joseph's College and then Loyola University to form [[Loyola Marymount University]]. At the time, the college was a two-year institution of higher education. In 1975, responsibility for the College was transferred to a lay board of trustees.&lt;ref name="MCU web site-a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/?q=quick-facts|title=Quick Facts - Marymount California University|website=Marymountcalifornia.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the college changed its name from Marymount Palos Verdes College to Marymount College. In summer 2011, Marymount opened its Waterfront Campus in downtown [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="dailybreeze.com"&gt;[http://www.dailybreeze.com/moresanpedro/ci_18680236?source=email] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2013, Marymount changed its name from Marymount College to Marymount California University to reflect "an ongoing transformation of the 45-year-old institution of higher education to a multi-campus institution offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs." In fall 2013, Marymount opened its Lakeside Campus in the community of Lucerne in rural Lake County, in Northern California.&lt;ref name=petersons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407074951/http://www.the-tidings.com/index.php/features/san-pedro/3282-marymount-college-changes-name-to-reflect-growth-mission |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the university appointed trustee Brian Marcotte its new president. It was not immediately clear why the previous president, Lucas Lamadrid, left the position although the local newspaper ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' reported "allegations of inappropriate behavior, exorbitant spending and discriminatory conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailybreeze.com/2018/02/05/marymount-california-university-president-mia-amid-allegations-of-inappropriate-behavior/ |title= Marymount California University president MIA amid allegations of inappropriate behavior |author=Valerie Osier |publisher=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=February 5, 2018 |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Waterfront Campus''' encompasses the first floor of the former [[Northrop Grumman]] facility at 222 W. Sixth St., and provides classroom and studio space for upper division students, as well as some office space for [[Business school|faculty and staff]].

'''Residential Community''' include The Villas located in adjacent San Pedro, a community of fully furnished, two-story townhomes that can accommodate 400 students and staff.  In the center of the community is a swimming pool, fitness center, outdoor covered pavilion, beach volleyball court, basketball court and a soon to be completed outdoor kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/san-pedro-residential |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140403163124/http://www.marymountcalifornia.edu/san-pedro-residential |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moby Project''' is a collection of public-domain lexical resources. It was created by [[Grady Ward]]. The resources were dedicated to the public domain, and are now mirrored at [[Project Gutenberg]]. {{As of|2007}}, it contains the largest free phonetic database, with 177,267 words and corresponding pronunciations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Hyphenator ==
The '''Moby Hyphenator II''' contains [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenations]] of 187,175 words and phrases (including 9,752 entries where no hyphenations are given, such as ''through'' and ''avoir'').  The character encoding appears to be [[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]], and hyphenation is indicated by a bullet (character value 165 decimal, or A5 hexadecimal).  Some entries, however, have a combination of actual hyphens and character 165, such as "bar•ber-sur•geon".

There is little to no documentation of the hyphenation choices made; the following examples might give some flavour of the style of hyphenation used: at•mos•phere; at•tend•ant; ca•pac•i•ty; un•col•or•a•ble.

== Language ==
'''Moby Language II''' contains wordlists of five languages: [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Language
! Words
! Size (in [[byte]]s)
|-
! French
|align="right"| 138,257
|align="right"| 1,524,757
|-
! German
|align="right"| 159,809
|align="right"| 2,055,986
|-
! Italian
|align="right"| 60,453
|align="right"| 561,981
|-

|align="right"| 115,523
|align="right"| 934,783
|-
! Spanish
|align="right"| 86,059
|align="right"| 850,523
|-
! Total
|align="right"| 560,101
! 5,928,030
|}

However, some of the lists are contaminated, for example the Japanese list contains English words such as ''abnormal'' and non-words such as ''abcdefgh'' and ''m,./''.  There are also unusual peculiarities in the sorting of these lists, as the French list contains a straight alphabetical listing, while the German list contains the alphabetical listing of traditionally capitalized words and then the alphabetical listing of traditionally lower-cased words.  The list of Italian words, however, contains no capitalized words whatsoever.

The foreign languages list does not use accented characters, so "e^tre" is how a user would look up the French word ''être'' ("To Be").

== Part-of-Speech ==
'''Moby Part-of-Speech''' contains 233,356 words fully described by [[Lexical category|part(s) of speech]], listed in priority order. The format of the file is ''word\parts-of-speech'', with the following parts of speech being identified:

{| class="wikitable"

| r
|-
| [[Article (grammar)|Definite article]]
| D
|-
| [[Article (grammar)|Indefinite article]]
| I
|-
| [[Nominative]]
| o
|}

== Pronunciator ==
The '''Moby Pronunciator II''' contains 177,267 entries with corresponding pronunciations. Most of the entries describe a single word, but approximately 79,000&lt;ref&gt;Obtained by running the UNIX command ''grep '.*[-_].* .*' mobypron.unc | wc -l'' after converting the line endings and correcting some encoding errors.&lt;/ref&gt; contain hyphenated or multiple word phrases, names, or [[lexemes]]. The Project Gutenberg distribution also contains a copy of the [[cmudict]] v0.3. The file contains lines of the format ''word[/part-of-speech] pronunciation''. Each line is ended with the ASCII [[Carriage Return]] character (CR, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal).

The ''word'' field can include apostrophes (e.g. ''isn't''), hyphens (e.g. ''able-bodied''), and multiple words separated by underscores (e.g. ''monkey_wrench''). Non-English words are generally rendered, as stated in the documentation, without accents or other diacritical marks. However, in 36 entries (e.g. ''São_Miguel''), some non-ASCII accented characters remain, represented using [[Mac OS Roman]] encoding.

The part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example, for the words spelled ''close,'' the verb has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|z}}, whereas the adjective is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|s}}. The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part-of-speech
! Code
|-
| [[Noun]]
| n
|-
| [[Verb]]
| v
|-
| [[Adjective]]
| aj
|-
| [[Adverb]]
| av
|-
| [[Interjection]]
| interj
|}

Following this is the pronunciation. Several special symbols are present:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol
! Meaning
|-
| _
| Used to separate words
|-
| '
| [[Primary stress]] on the following syllable
|-
| ,
| [[Secondary stress]] on the following syllable
|}

The rest of the symbols are used to represent [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] characters. The pronunciations are generally consistent with a [[General American]] dialect of English, that exhibits [[father-bother merger]], [[hurry-furry merger]] and [[lot-cloth split]], but does not exhibit [[cot-caught merger]] or [[wine-whine merger]]. Each phoneme is represented by a sequence of one or more characters. Some of the sequences are delimited with a slash character "/", as shown in the following table, but note that the sequence for {{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} is delimited by ''two'' slash characters at either end:

To this collection are added a number of extra sequences representing phonemes found in several other languages. These are used to encode the non-English words, phrases and names that are included in the database. The following table contains these extra phonemes, but note that the extent to which some of these may exist due to encoding errors is not clear.

[[Image:MonaKimProjects PremiereVision.jpg|right|frame|Scenography created by Mona Kim for the world's largest fashion fabric show [[Premiere Vision]]. Paris, 14–16 sep 2010.]]
'''Mona Kim''' (born March 15, 1967) is a Korean-American designer born in South Korea and educated in the United States. Kim is a multidisciplinary design consultant and a visual artist for cultural and commercial projects ([[Mona Kim Projects]]).

Through synthesizing words, images, public spaces, and technology, Kim has directed award-winning projects for her clients: environmental design for museum exhibitions; advertising campaigns for fashion and beauty; branded art installations; interactive sensorial spaces; direction and scriptwriting for audio-visual installations; editorial design.

==Life and career==
Kim is a [[Carnegie Mellon University]] graduate with BFA degree with Honors in Design. She had been selected by [[IBM]] Strategic Design branch during her last year in the university to collaborate with leaders in the design field such as [[Edward Tufte]] and Sam Lucente.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hindo |first=Brian |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/nov2005/id20051101_609886.htm |title='The Front Lines' of Innovation |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=November 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Kim moved to Italy which had significantly influenced her work and life philosophy to date. In Milan, she had worked with the late [[Ettore Sottsass]] and had been introduced to the instinctual approach to design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

'''NetCorps''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Cyberjeunes'') was a volunteer-organizing coalition consisting of nine Canadian [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and managed by the NetCorps coordination unit.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/faq.php?tpl=orange "NetCorps Frequently asked questions"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the program, the organizations created international [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) internships in developing countries around the world. Interns typically participated in six-month programs, leaving between August and November for host organizations in the placement countries. Positions were limited to 19–30-year-old Canadian citizens or landed immigrants who had "appropriate information and communication technologies skills".&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; Typical duties included creating webpages, developing databases, computer networking, setting up hardware, preparing manuals and other documentation, and general-to-advanced computer instruction.

==Program ==

===Objectives===

* To strengthen the ICT capacity of civil society and public-sector organizations to contribute to development goals in governance, education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability
* Increase the professional skills and capacities of young Canadians aged 19 to 30 to contribute positively to Canadian international development efforts and secure meaningful employment
* To increase the awareness and promote greater engagement of young Canadians with respect to international development issues&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

===Budget===
During the 2007-2008 season, the program placed 240 interns and was funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and Human Resources and [[Social Development Canada]] (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and accommodation expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a completion bonus.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

==History==

===NetCorps creation===

NetCorps Canada International was conceived in 1996 by Dr. David Johnston (Governor General of Canada as of 2011 and former President of the [[University of Waterloo]]), a prominent lawyer and adviser to the federal government on information-highway issues.

===Phase I===

In 1997 [[Industry Canada]], in partnership with the Special Initiatives Division of Canada's [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), funded a NetCorps-style test project that sent two residents of Cape Breton to Angola for Internet and [[Geographic Information System]]s projects. This NetCorps conceptualization and placement was done through the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) and Dr.[[Michael Gurstein]], Director of the Centre and (at the time) Chair in the Management of Technology Change at the [[University College of Cape Breton]]. An initial NetCorps training program and manual were produced as a result of this program. Notably, the two placements in Angola were of previously unemployed young adults from Cape Breton; they were provided with training in [[Linux]] through C/CEN as part of a demonstration program in the economic benefits that could be achieved through local investment in Information and Communications Technologies in economically marginal regions.

===Phase II===

In 1998 the efforts of Industry Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and a consortium of Canada’s largest international development volunteer-sending agencies secured 14 internships in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

===Phase III===

Further collaboration with Industry Canada and the consortium of international development agencies in 1998 saw the Canadian International Development Agency offer 30 internships in the Americas. This phase was announced by the Prime Minister at the [[2nd Summit of the Americas]] in Santiago, Chile in April 1998.

===Phase IV - NetCorps Canada International===

From 1999 to 2006, the NetCorps consortium sent more than 1700 NetCorps volunteers overseas, due to the collaboration of Industry Canada and the Youth Employment Strategy financed by [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC).

===2006–2007 – Transition Year===

In 2006–2007, the consortium successfully organized the placement of 236 volunteers in collaboration with Industry Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 2006-2007 was the last year that Industry Canada would be involved in the NetCorps program.

===Phase VI – 2007–2008===

For 2007–2008, (CIDA) replaced Industry Canada as funders of the NetCorps program. The 240 placements offered that year were once again part of the Government of Canada’s youth-employment strategy.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/history.php?tpl=red "A history of NetCorps Canada International"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was discontinued indefinitely as of the 2008–2009 season.&lt;ref name="mainpage"&gt;[http://www.netcorps-cyberjeunes.org/nouveau-siteweb/home.php? "NetCorps News"], ''NetCorps-Cyberjeunes Canada International'', Retrieved: October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Networking and Information Technology Research and Development''' (NITRD) program consists of a group of [[List of United States federal agencies|U.S. federal agencies]] to research and develop [[information technology]] (IT) capabilities to empower Federal missions; support U.S. science, engineering, and technology leadership; and bolster U.S. economic competitiveness. &lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for American Innovation: Securing Our Economic Growth and Prosperity," President Barack Obama, February 4, 2011 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/InnovationStrategy.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The NITRD Program is managed by the NITRD Subcommittee of the [[National_Science_and_Technology_Council | National Science and Technology Council]]’s (NSTC) Committee on Technology and supported by the NITRD National Coordination Office (NCO).

===Working Groups===
NITRD Program’s member agencies coordinate their NITRD research activities and plans by Interagency Working Groups (IWGs). For each IWG, agency representatives meet to exchange information and collaborate on research plans and activities such as testbeds, workshops, and cooperative proposal solicitations. 

===Program Component Areas===
The annual NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget is organized by Program Component Areas (PCAs), where the PCAs are major subject areas for federal IT R&amp;D. PCAs are intended to facilitate budgetary comparisons from year to year in each area. The PCA set evolves over time, reflecting changes in IT R&amp;D activities at federal agencies and IT R&amp;D priorities of the Administration&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nitrd.gov/subcommittee/NITRD-PCAs.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. In its first annual report to Congress, the Supplement to the President’s Fiscal Year 1992 Budget, HPCC reported a FY 1991 base budget of $489 million, with eight federal agencies participating, and four R&amp;D components. The FY 2017 NITRD Supplement to the President’s Budget reports to Congress an estimated budget of $4.54 billion across 21 Federal agencies and 10 R&amp;D focus areas.

=== Coordination ===
NITRD's National Coordination Office (NCO) supports NITRD's planning, budget, and assessment activities. The NCO also supports the NITRD Subcommittee, which coordinates the NITRD Program, and the organizations that report to the Subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nitrd.gov/About/about_nco.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The NCO's director is appointed by the Director of the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]].

The NCO works with the NITRD agencies, IWGs, CGs and the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]] to prepare, publish, and disseminate the Program's annual supplement to the President's Budget, Federal networking and IT R&amp;D plans, and networking and IT research needs reports.

The NCO provides technical support for the activities of the Networking and Information Technology Subcommittee of the [[President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]], a panel of experts from industry and academia, in assessing the NITRD Program and preparing associated reports.

The NCO maintains the NITRD Web site - https://www.nitrd.gov - which contains information about the Program and electronic versions of NITRD documents

== History and legal background ==
The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program (formerly known as High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program) was created by the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991]], (P.L. 102-194)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/272/text High Performance Computing Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-194)]&lt;/ref&gt; and amended by the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-305) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/173/1&lt;/ref&gt;, and the America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2272&lt;/ref&gt;. NITRD was reauthorized by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (P.L. 114-329)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084/text&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dr. [[Donald_A.B._Lindberg | Donald A.B. Lindberg]] was the founding Director of the National Coordination Office (NCO) for NITRD, formerly the NCO for High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC). The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 called for the coordination of activities in high-performance computing and the establishment of a National Research and Education Network (NREN) across Federal agencies. Dr. Lindberg led this effort from 1992 to 1995 while serving concurrently as the Director of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Nightcart.gif|thumb|right|18th-century London nightman's calling card]]

'''Night soil''' is a historically used [[euphemism]] for [[Human waste|human excreta]] collected from [[cesspit|cesspools]], privies, [[pail closet]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, [[privy midden]]s, [[septic tank]]s, etc. This material was removed from the immediate area, usually at night, by workers employed in this trade. Sometimes it could be transported out of towns and sold on as a [[fertilizer]]. 

Another definition is "untreated excreta transported without water (e.g. via containers or buckets)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanitation safety planning: manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta.|author = Jackson, D| author2=Winkler, M| author3=Stenström, TA|publisher = World Health Organization|date=2015|isbn = 978 92 4 154924 0|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssp-manual/en/|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "night soil" is largely an [[Archaism|archaic word]], used in historical contexts. The modern term is "fecal sludge"; [[fecal sludge management]] is an ongoing challenge, particularly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/TILLEY%20et%20al%202014%20Compendium%20of%20Sanitation%20Systems%20and%20Technologies%20-%202nd%20Revised%20Edition.pdf|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|edition = 2nd Revised|author = Tilley, E.|author2 = Ulrich, L.|author3 = Lüthi, C.|author4 = Reymond, Ph.|author5 = Zurbrügg, C.|date=2014|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night soil was produced as a result of a [[sanitation]] system in areas without [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] or [[septic tank]]s. In this system of waste management, the human feces are collected without dilution with water.

==Collection and disposal==
{{Main|Fecal sludge management}}
Feces were excreted into a container such as a [[chamber pot]], and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence [[slopping out]]). The excrement in the pail was often covered with earth (soil), which may have contributed to the term "night soil." Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a [[shophouse]]. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Disposal has varied through time. In urban areas, a night soil collector arrived regularly, at varying time periods depending on the supply and demand for night soil collection. Usually this occurred during the night, giving the night soil its name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In isolated rural areas such as in [[farm]]s, the [[household]] usually disposed of the night soil themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Uses in agriculture==
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Human excreta may be attractive as [[fertilizer]] because of the high demand for fertilizer and the relative availability of the material to create night soil. In areas where native soil is of poor quality, the local population may weigh the risk of using night soil.

The use of unprocessed human feces as fertilizer is a risky practice as it may contain [[Faecal-oral route|disease-causing pathogens]]. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common [[parasitic worm]] infections, such as [[ascariasis]], in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted from one infected person to another person ([[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] of disease).

These risks are reduced by proper [[fecal sludge management]], e.g. via [[compost]]ing. The safe reduction of [[human excreta]] into compost is possible. Some municipalities create [[compost]] from the [[sewage sludge]], but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claims have been made that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of [[heavy metals]].

==History==

===Ancient Attica===
The use of sewage as fertilizer was common in ancient Attica. The sewage system of ancient Athens collected the sewage of the city in a large reservoir and then channelled it to the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus river]] valley for use as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Life of Greece'', PP. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===China, Hong Kong, and Singapore===
[[File:China; a woman carrying buckets of night-soil. Wellcome L0056427.jpg|thumb|A woman carrying buckets of night-soil, photographed in 1871.]]
The term is known, or even infamous, among the generations that were born in parts of China or [[Chinatowns]] (depending on the development of the infrastructure) before 1960. Post-[[World War II]] [[Chinatown, Singapore]], before the [[history of Singapore|independence of Singapore]], utilized night-soil collection as a primary means of waste disposal, especially as much of the infrastructure was damaged and took a long time to rebuild following the [[Battle of Singapore]] and subsequent [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Following the development of the economy and the [[standard of living]] after independence, the night soil system in Singapore is now merely a curious anecdote from the time of colonial rule when new systems developed.

The collection method is generally very manual and heavily relies on close human contact with the waste. During the Nationalist era when the [[Kuomintang]] ruled [[mainland China]], as well as Chinatown in Singapore, the night soil collector usually arrived with spare and relatively empty [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s to exchange for the full honey buckets. The method of transporting the honey buckets from individual households to collection centers was very similar to delivering [[water supply|water supplies]] by an unskilled laborer, with the exception that the item being transported was not at all [[drinking water|potable]]  and it was being delivered ''from'' the household, rather than ''to'' the household. The collector would hang full honey buckets onto each end of a pole he carried on his shoulder and then proceeded to carry it through the streets until he reached the collection point.

Hong Kong has a similar euphemism for night soil collection, {{lang|zh|倒夜香}} ''dàoyèxiāng'', which literally means "emptying nocturnal fragrance".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Japan ===
{{see also|Toilets in Japan}}
The reuse of [[Human feces|feces]] as fertilizer was common in Japan. In [[Edo]] city, compost merchants gathered feces to sell for farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. [[Human waste|Human excreta]] of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, P., Walthall. A., &amp; Palias, J. (2006). Modern east asia: A cultural, social, &amp; political history. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston &amp; New York. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after [[World War II]], both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is used for night soil fertilization{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. The presence of the [[Occupation of Japan|United States occupying force]], by whom the use of human waste as fertilizer was seen as unhygienic and suspect, was also a contributing factor: "the Occupationaires condemned the practice, and tried to prevent their compatriots from eating vegetables and fruit from the local markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|title=Pictures|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=4 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615140135/http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|archivedate=15 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico and Central America===
Various [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations used human feces to fertilize their crops. The Aztecs, in particular, are well known for their famous [[chinampa]]s, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] in the year 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico." Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; They were constructed by first fencing an area between 30 m x 2.5 m and 91 m x 9 m, using wattle.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, P. (1976). Mysteries of the Mexican pyramids. Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited: Toronto. pp. 299 {{ISBN|0-06-014324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge, M et al. (2011). Mathematical accuracy of Aztec land surveys assessed from records in the Codex Vergara. PNAS: University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Then filled in with mud, sediment, feces and decaying vegetation. To stabilize the chinampas, trees were often planted on the corners, primarily ''āhuexōtl'' (''[[Salix bonplandiana]]'') or ''āhuēhuētl'' (''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;"Taxodium mucronatum". The Gymnosperm Database. Retrieved 2009-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinampas were very common before Spanish conquest and are still found in Mexico today.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Gladstone sanitary ware night soil containers 3928.JPG|thumb|Industrially produced "sanitary ware", now in the [[Gladstone Pottery Museum]]]]
A [[gong farmer]] was the term used in Tudor England for a person employed to remove human excrement from privies and cesspits.  Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries.

The rapid industrialisation of England during the nineteenth century led to mass urbanisation, over-crowding, and epidemics. One response was the development of the "Rochdale system", in which the town council arranged for the collection of the night soil from the outhouse attached to each dwelling or group of dwellings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calow|first1=Dennis|title=Home Sweet Home: A century of Leicester housing 1814-1914|date=2007|publisher=Univ of Leicester|url=http://cdm15407.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15407coll5/id/1181|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[pail closet]]). A later response was the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]], which led to the creation of [[Byelaw terraced house|byelaws regarding housing]], mandating one outhouse per house. These were still "earth closets" (not water closets i.e. WCs) and so still depended on the "night soil men" or "nightmen".

== Current examples ==

===India===
People responsible for the disposal of night soil are considered [[Dalit|untouchables]] in India. The practice of untouchability was banned by law when India gained independence, but the tradition widely persists as the law is difficult to enforce.  This "[[manual scavenging]]" is now illegal in all Indian states.

The Indian government's Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment stated in 2003 that 676,000 people were employed in the manual collection of human waste in India. Social organizations have estimated that up to 1.3 million Indians collect such waste. Further, workers in the collection of human waste were confined to marriage amongst themselves, thereby leading to a waste-collecting caste, which passes its profession on from generation to generation.

Employment of Manual Scavengers and Creation of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 has made manual scavenging illegal.

=== Japan ===
Modern Japan still has areas with ongoing night soil collection and disposal. The Japanese name for the "outhouse within the house" style toilet, where night soil is collected for disposal, is ''kumitori benjo'' (汲み取り便所). The proper disposal or [[recycling]] of sewage remains an important research area that is highly political.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1547">The '''Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative''' or '''Northwest Straits Initiative''' ('''NWSI''') was established under Title IV of Public Law 105–384 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;105th Congress. (1998, November 13). Title IV. Public Law 105-384, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of the [[Northwest Straits Commission]], the [[Marine Resources Committees]], and the [[Northwest Straits Foundation]].

The NWSI was born from political deadlock over the proposed formation of a federal marine sanctuary in the waters of northwest Washington, including Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan Islands. Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Congressman Jack Metcalf proposed the Initiative as an alternative to the marine sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;"Giving locals a chance."

The Islands' Weekly 18 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWSI focuses on conservation and restoration of [[Puget Sound]] in northwest Washington State and relies on the work of local, citizen-based Marine Resources Committees (located in seven counties) to prioritize actions in recovering the health of the sound.&lt;ref&gt;Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team. "New Initiative Tackles 'Tough Problems' to Protect, Restore Marine Resources." Sound Waves 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The seven Washington State counties are: Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam.

PSE became a statutory requirement in schools in September 2003, and is compulsory for all [[student]]s at [[Key Stage]]s 1, 2, 3 and 4 (5 to 16 years old), and shares some similar elements with [[Personal, Social and Health Education]] and [[Citizenship|citizenship education]] in [[England]]. These include:
* local and global [[community|communities]]
* [[sex education]]
* [[spirituality]]
* [[morals]]
* [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]]

==The PSE Framework==
For each Key Stage, learning outcomes for Knowledge &amp; Understanding are set in each of the Aspects (listed below); additionally, learning outcomes for the development of Attitudes &amp; Values and Skills are prescribed across all Aspects. [[ACCAC]], the curriculum authority for Wales (part of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] from 1 April 2006), published these in the [[Personal and Social Education Framework|PSE Framework]] (2000). While it is not compulsory for schools to use the Framework, they are expected to use [[scheme of work|schemes of work]] in order to standardize practice across [[teacher]]s and [[Class (education)|class]]es.

Aspects:

* Community
* Emotional
* Environmental
* Learning
* Moral
* Physical
* Sexual
* Social
* Spiritual
* Vocational

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">Anna Cecilia '''Petra Östergren''' (born 29 September 1965 in [[Kiruna Municipality]]) is a Swedish [[feminist]] writer, debater, social commentator and an instructor in [[self defense]]. She has an MA in [[Social Anthropology]] ([[University of Stockholm]]), and is a doctoral student at [[Lund University]]. Her research is titled "The State of Feminism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=4626 Ulrika Oredsson.

== Self-defence ==
In the 1980s Östergren  helped launch a feminist self-defense movement in [[Sweden]]. She was active as an instructor in the organisation ''Pandora kvinnligt försvar'' (Pandora Women's Defense) and ran the Kung Fu club in the [[kajukenbo]] style in an effort to help women defend themselves against sexual assault. She was involved with the National Organisation for Women's Shelters and [[Roks]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roks.se/ Roks: Riksorganisationen för kvinnojourer och tjejjourer i Sverige (National organisation for women's and young women's shelters in Sweden)]&lt;/ref&gt;
She is the author of ''Slå tillbaka!: Handbok i självförsvar'' (Fight back!; A handbook of self-defence) published in 1993. She also wrote a book about her mother, who was beaten to death by a man she had had a brief relationship with, entitled ''Att komma till ro med det allra värsta'' (Coming to terms with the worst).

== Sociology and gender politics ==
Her involvement with teaching men self-defence made her a controversial figure with radical feminists, and the rift became complete when she published an article in [[Bang (magazine)|Bang]] magazine in which she questioned whether all pornography was essentially misogynous.

Östergren is considered a major critic of [[radical feminism]] in Sweden. In particular she has challenged their views on sex, violence and power, pointing out that violence in [[lesbian]] relationships did not differ significantly from that in [[heterosexual]] relationships. From its origin, Östergren was one of the few people who publicly challenged the radical feminist position on [[Prostitution in Sweden|prostitution]] which culminated in the ''sexköpslagen'' (Sex Purchase Act) 1999. She has been an advocate for the decriminalisation of prostitution. In 2006, she published ''Porr, horor och feminister'' (Pornography, whores and other feminists), an analysis of three decades of Swedish policy on [[pornography]] and prostitution, and a critique of radical feminist sexual politics. In 2008, she published an edited volume ''F-ordet: Mot en ny feminism'' (The F -word: Towards a new feminism), bringing together writers and commentators to provide new perspectives on old feminist issues.

== Work ==
In addition to her books, Östergren writes regularly for newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', ''[[LO-tidningen]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'', ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', [[Axess magasin|''Axess'']] and ''Voltaire'' and regularly gives public talks, and is consulted on prostitution and gender issues.

'''Philosophy of history''' is the philosophical study of [[history]] and the past. The term was coined by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction is made between critical philosophy of history (also known as analytic) and speculative philosophy of history. The names of these types are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and [[speculative philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The former studies the past itself whereas the latter is the equivalent of what the [[philosophy of science]] is for nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some overlap between the two aspects, they can usually be distinguished; modern professional historians tend to be skeptical about speculative philosophy of history.

Sometimes critical philosophy of history is included under [[historiography]]. Philosophy of history should not be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas in their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-collini/what-intellectual-history|title=What is Intellectual History?|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern history==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''must'' or ''should'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46–120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''—about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 – c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274).&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something "totally new to his age") and he often referred to it as his "new science",&lt;ref&gt;

which is now associated with [[historiography]]. His [[historical method]] also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]], and [[systematic bias]] in history.&lt;ref name=Mowlana/&gt;

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach—focusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830–1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} form. In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

==Cyclical and linear history==
{{further information|Social cycle theory}}

Narrative history tends to follow an assumption of linear progression: "this happened, and then that happened; that happened because this happened first".

Many ancient cultures held [[Religion and mythology|mythical]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s (eons). Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which?|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], [[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara]], [[Treta Yuga|Treta]] and [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] [[yuga]]s. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four [[stages of character]] during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

The story of [[the Fall of Man]] from the [[Garden of Eden]], as recounted and elaborated in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], preserves traces of a moral cycle; this would give the basis for [[theodicy|theodicies]] which attempt to reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the existence of a God, providing a global explanation of history with belief in a coming [[Messianic Age]]. Some theodicies claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as the [[Apocalypse]], organized by a superior power. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (in his ''Discourse On [[Universal History]]'' of 1679) formulated such theodicies, but [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646-1716), who coined the term ''Théodicée'', developed the most famous philosophical theodicy. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, while man might see certain events as evil (such as wars, epidemics and natural disasters), such a judgement in fact only reflected human perception; if one adopted [[God's view]], "evil" events in fact only took place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was not, however, a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz invented the theory of "[[compossible worlds]]", distinguishing two types of necessity, to cope with the problem of [[determinism]].

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{cn|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822–1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield| Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
&lt;/ref&gt;
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

The development of mathematical models of long-term secular sociodemographic cycles revived interest in cyclical theories of history (see, for example, ''Historical Dynamics'' (2003) by [[Peter Turchin]], or ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainable history==
''"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man"'' is a philosophy of history proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], where history is defined as ''a durable progressive trajectory in which the quality of life on this planet or all other planets is premised on the guarantee of human dignity for all at all times under all circumstances.''&lt;ref&gt;Nayef R.F. Al-Rodhan, Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph (Berlin: [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80005-3 LIT], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views history as a linear progression propelled by [[good governance]], which is, in turn, to be achieved through balancing the emotional, amoral, and egoistic elements of [[human nature]] with the human dignity needs of reason, security, [[human rights]], accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154010/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human dignity'' lies at the heart of this theory and is paramount for ensuring the sustainable history of humankind. Among other things, [[human dignity]] means having a positive sense of self and instilling individuals with respect for the communities to which they belong. Thus, reconciling humans' predisposition for emotionally self-interested behavior with the imperatives of human dignity appears as the one of the most important challenges to global policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm Geneva Press Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003094748/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At national level, they have to protect their citizens against violence and provide them with access to food, housing, clothes, health care, and education. Basic welfare provision and security are fundamental to ensuring human dignity. Environment and ecological considerations need to be addressed as well. Finally, cultural diversity, inclusiveness and participation at all levels, of all communities are key imperatives of human dignity.

In this respect, the sustainable history philosophy challenges existing concepts of [[civilisations]], such as [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington's]] ''[[Clash of Civilisations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpleasures.com/websitepublisher/articles/2610/1/-Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-Reviewed-By-Norm-Goldman-of-Bookpleasurescom/Page1.html|title=Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.com|work=bookpleasures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it argues that human civilisation should not be thought of as consisting of numerous separate and competing civilisations, but rather it should be thought of collectively as only one human civilisation. Within this civilisation are many geo-cultural domains that comprise'' [[sub-cultures]]. ''[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]]'' ''envisions human civilisation as an ocean into which the different geo-cultural domains flow like rivers,'' "The Ocean Model of one Human Civilization". ''At points where geo-cultural domains first enter the ocean of human civilisation, there is likely to be a concentration or dominance of that culture. However, over time, all the rivers of geo-cultural domains become one. There is fluidity at the ocean's centre and cultures have the opportunity to borrow between them. Under such historical conditions the most advanced forms of human enterprise can thrive and lead us to a'' 'civilisational triumph'. ''Nevertheless, there are cases where geographical proximity of various cultures can also lead to friction and conflict.

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] concludes that within an increasingly globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, human dignity cannot be ensured globally and in a sustainable way through sole national means. A genuine global effort is required to meet the minimum criteria of human dignity globally. Areas such as conflict prevention, socio-economic justice, gender equality, protection of human rights, environmental protection require a holistic approach and a common action.

==The Enlightenment's ideal of progress==
{{further information|Age of Enlightenment |Social progress}}

During the ''Aufklärung'', or Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" or [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were one of the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the ''Aufklärung'' conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]]. In ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' (1784), [[Immanuel Kant]] defined the ''Aufklärung'' as the capacity to think by oneself, without referring to an exterior authority, be it a prince or tradition:

{{quotation|Enlightenment is when a person leaves behind a state of immaturity and dependence (''Unmündigkeit'') for which they themselves were responsible. Immaturity and dependence are the inability to use one's own [[intellect]] without the direction of another. One is responsible for this immaturity and dependence, if its cause is not a lack of intelligence or education, but a lack of determination and courage to think without the direction of another. ''[[wikt:Sapere aude|Sapere aude]]! Dare to know!'' is therefore the slogan of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].}}

In a paradoxical way, Kant supported in the same time [[enlightened despotism]] as a way of leading humanity towards its [[autonomy]]. He had conceived the process of history in his short treaty ''[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]'' (1784). On one hand, enlightened despotism was to lead nations toward their liberation, and progress was thus inscribed in the scheme of history; on the other hand, liberation could only be acquired by a singular gesture, ''Sapere Aude''! Thus, autonomy ultimately relied on the individual's "determination and courage to think without the direction of another."

After Kant, [[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]: the negative (wars, etc.) was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.|&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real—and, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

===Social evolutionism===
{{further information|Sociocultural evolution}} &lt;!-- the time sphere --&gt;
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798–1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in "[[social Darwinism]]" theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the "[[Aryan race]]" which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]]. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Valéry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from an [[Alexandre Kojève|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution &amp; History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.&lt;ref&gt;" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The validity of the "great man theory" in historical studies===
{{further|Hero#The hero in historical studies|Great man theory}}

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of "[[Great man theory|great men]]" in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, ''[[hero]]es'', such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare in the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals,'' defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The Great Man approach to history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. For example, to read about (what is known today as) the "[[Migrations Period]]," consult the biography of [[Attila the Hun]].

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

The [[Annales School]], founded by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark on the shift from a history centered on [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history, [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]], etc., were inspired by this School.

==Is history predetermined?==
There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic (see [[historical determinism]]). Some argue that geography (see [[geographic determinism]]), economic systems (see [[economic determinism]]), or culture (see [[cultural determinism]]) prescribe "the iron laws of history" that decide what is to happen. Others see history as a long line of acts and accidents, big and small, each playing out its consequences until that process gets interrupted by the next.

It should be noted that even determinists do not rule that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

[[Karl Marx]] is, perhaps, the most famous of the exponents of economic determinism. For him social institutions like political system, religion and culture were merely by-products of the basic economic system (see [[Base and superstructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: ''Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does history have a teleological sense?==
{{further|Social progress|Progress (history)}}

[[Theodicy]] claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, given by a superior power. However, this transcendent teleological sense can be thought as [[Immanence|immanent]] to human history itself. Hegel probably represents the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (see ''Social evolutionism'' above). Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they saw, and see, progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled (see above). History was best seen as directed by a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and traces of the Zeitgeist could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward "[[civilization]]", and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the "[[End of History]]". In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

===Historical accounts of writing history===
{{further information|Historiography}}
A classic example of history being written by the victors—or more precisely, by the survivors&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing African History|author=Philips, John Edward|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—would be the scarcity of unbiased information that has survived to the present about the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. Roman historians left tales of cruelty and [[human sacrifice]] practiced by their longtime enemies; however no Carthaginian was left alive to give their side of the story.

Similarly, we only have the [[History of Christianity|Christian]] side of how Christianity came to be the dominant religion of Europe. However, we know very little about other European religions, such as [[Paganism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} We have the European version of the [[European colonisation of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], with an interpretation of the native version of events only emerging to popular consciousness since the early 1980s. We have [[Herodotus]]'s Greek history of the [[Persian Wars]], but the Persian recall of the events is little known in Western Culture.

In many respects, the head of state may be guilty of cruelties or even simply a different way of doing things. In some societies, however, to speak of or write critically of rulers can amount to conviction of treason and death. As such, in many ways, what is left as the "official record" of events is oft influenced by one's desire to avoid exile or execution.

However, "losers" in certain time periods often have more of an impetus than the "winners" to write histories that comfort themselves and [[self-justification|justify]] their own behavior.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; Examples include the historiography of the [[American Civil War]], where it can be argued that the losers (Southerners) have written more history books on the subject than the winners and, until recently, dominated the national perception of history. Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Jackson]] are generally held in higher esteem than their Union counterparts. Popular films such as ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' have told the story from the Southern viewpoint. Also, despite "losing" the [[Vietnam War]], the United States produces more scholarship on the war than any other country, including Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War|author=Wiest, Andrew A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular history abounds with condemnations of the cruelty of [[African slave trade]]rs and [[Colonization of Africa|colonists]], despite the "winning" status of those people in their heyday.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

As is true of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian populations of America]], the historical record of America being [[European colonization of the Americas|"discovered" by Europeans]] is now sometimes presented as a history of invasion, exploitation and dominance of a people who had been there before the Europeans. This reinterpretation of the historical record is called [[historical revisionism]], which can take the form of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]], which is the denial of [[genocide]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. The revision of previously accepted historical accounts is a constant process in which "today's winners are tomorrow's losers", and the rise and fall of present institutions and movements influence the way historians see the past.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; In the same sense, the teaching, in [[Education in France|French secondary schools]], of the [[Algerian War of Independence#Historiography of the war and of colonialism|Algerian War of Independence and of colonialism]], has been criticized by several historians, and is the subject of frequent debates. Thus, in contradiction with the February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party, historian Benjamin Stora notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Algerians do not appear in their "indigenous" conditions and their sub-citizens status, as the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|history of nationalist movement]] is never evoqued, as none of the great figures of the resistance — [[Messali Hadj]], [[Ferhat Abbas]] — emerge nor retain attention, in one word, as no one explains to students what has been colonisation, we make them unable to understand why the decolonisation took place.&lt;ref name="DiploApril"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2001/04/04algeriatorture Colonialism through the school books - The hidden history of the Algerian war], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2001 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hero]] --&gt;

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975–76) considered [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized under the name of "[[race struggle]]"—however, the meaning of "race" was different from today's biological notion, being closer to the sense of "nation" (distinct from [[nation-states]]; its signification is here closer to "people"). [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regarded him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (Nazism). According to Foucault, [[Marxist]]s also seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought: discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the "subject" is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economical [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth: truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of "race struggle". History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building,he(the sovereign) built monuments,fought in wars and claims victory on behalf of himself which ultimately became the discourse of the people (modern population), a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the "[[historical subject]]" must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the [[sovereignty|Sovereign]] is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is {the historico-political discourse} a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

===History and education===

{{Further information|Education|Pedagogy|Philosophy of education}}
Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a necessary counterpart of ''The [[Social Contract]]'' (also 1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation-states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.

In most societies, schools and curricula are controlled by governments. As such, there is always an opportunity for governments to impose. Granted, often governments in free societies serve to protect freedoms, check [[hate speech]], and breaches of constitutional rights; but the power itself to impose is available to use the education system to influence thought of malleable minds, positively or negatively, towards truth or towards a version of truth. A recent example of the fragility of government involvement with history textbooks was the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]].

===Narrative and history===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

===History and causality===

{{see also|Causality}}

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or, even, opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History as propaganda: Is history always written by the victors?===
In his "Society must be Defended", [[Michel Foucault]] posited that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]. (See ''Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse'' above.) Nations adopting such an approach would likely fashion a "universal" theory of history, a [[manifest destiny]] in the US, to support their aims, with a teleological and deterministic philosophy of history used to justify the inevitableness and rightness of their victories.

[[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' took a completely different view—according to him, defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor—confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. The concept evokes Hegel's [[Master–slave dialectic]]s—the master is dependent of the work of the slave, the slave has to take his master's and his own interests into account, gets more knowledge and more insight as the master; and in realising that the world around him was created by his own hands he may gain self-consciousness and emancipation. Schivelbusch worked on three basic examples, the South and its [[Lost cause]] after the Civil War, France after the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, and Germany following World War I. Wolfgang Schivelbusch view includes complex psychological and cultural responses of vanquished nations, from every level of society and sees a need and rise of creativity and various narratives for the defeated.&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Defeat by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans Jefferson Chase Granta, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/history.highereducation1 Guardian review 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a society [[Walter Benjamin]] believed that Marxist historians must take a radically different view point from the [[bourgeois]] and [[idealist]] points of view, in an attempt to create a sort of [[People's history|history from below]], which would be able to conceive an alternative conception of history, not based, as in classical historical studies, on the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]]—an approach that would invariably adhere to major states (the victors') points of view.  Philosopher Paul Ricoeur asked instead for a plurality in history writing. "We carry on several histories simultaneously, in times whose periods, crises, and pauses do not coincide. We enchain, abandon, and resume several histories, much as a chess player who plays several games at once, renewing now this one, now the another" (''History and Truth'' 186). [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is a fictional account of the manipulation of the historical record for nationalist aims and manipulation of power.

To some degree, all nations are active in the promotion of such "national stories", with ethnicity, nationalism, gender, power, heroic figures, class considerations and important national events and trends all clashing and competing within the narrative.

With regard to the [[history of science]], the introduction of new paradigms is depicted by [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name=kuhnw&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in science or technology is not based on single experiments or ideas per se, but needs a supportive environment and technical achievements to allow for a change of perspective.

The process may lead to [[format war]]s, which leaves losers and winners behind.

The [[Semmelweis reflex]] is a metaphor for the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs or paradigms, Semmelweis himself being driven into insanity, but his concept prevailing after his death grew in a strong [[narrative]] of the [[history of medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, K.

==Judgement of history&lt;!--'Judgement of history' redirects here--&gt;==
For Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopted the expression "[[:de:Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht|Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht]]" ("[[world history]] is a tribunal that judges the world"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem "Resignation" (published in 1786) and used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Janez Juhant, Bojan Žalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the twentieth century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the '''judgement of history'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19283">The standard '''[[problem of evil]]''' found in monotheistic religions does not apply to almost all traditions of '''[[Hinduism]]''' because it does not posit an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt;

Scholars have proposed alternate forms of the problem of evil based on Hinduism's karma and transmigration doctrines. According to Arthur Herman, karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of [[Adi Sankara]] and [[Ramanuja]].&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
[[Hinduism]] is a complex religion with many different currents or schools.&lt;ref name=bowker194&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bowker|title=Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7IcQL1JBvAC |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09903-5 |pages=194, 206–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent god (monotheistic god), and the classical formulations of the problem of evil and theodicy do not apply to most Hindu traditions. Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]]. Evil as well as good, along with suffering is considered real and caused by human free will, its source and consequences explained through the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism, as in other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufman | first=Whitley R.

One text of the ancient [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism, for example describes three kinds of suffering: first, of body and mind caused by diseases or personal behavior such as anger, greed, delusion, etc.; second, suffering caused by other beings such as men, beasts, reptiles etc.; third, suffering caused by the influence of yaksha, planets and such forces.&lt;ref name=othmar1998&gt;{{cite journal| author= Othmar Gächter |year= 1998| jstor= 40464839 |title= Evil and Suffering in Hinduism| journal= Anthropos|volume=Bd. 93, H. 4./6.|pages= 393–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu texts describe and discuss suffering caused by both moral evils and natural evils.&lt;ref name=othmar1998/&gt;

Hinduism and other Indian religions do not focus on the [[problem of evil]] as formulated in monotheistic religions, by attempting to reconcile the nature of one all-powerful, all-seeing, all-benevolent god with existence of evil.&lt;ref name="Herman1993p235"/&gt; Rather, they focus on the path to spiritual liberation called [[moksha]], one that grants bliss in the present life such that evil and suffering have no effect on the liberated person's state of inner peace and happiness, and attaining moksha also means an end to the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref name="Bowker1975p207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur L.

==Problem of Injustice in the Brahma sutras==
A version of the problem of evil appears in the ancient ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', probably composed between 200 BCE and 200 CE,&lt;ref name=nvisaeva36&gt;NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1281-7}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; a foundational text of the [[Vedanta]] tradition of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jamesloch124&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 124&lt;/ref&gt; Its verses 2.1.34 through 2.1.36 aphoristically mention a version of the problem of suffering and evil in the context of the abstract metaphysical Hindu concept of [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=sradha30&gt;S Radhakrishnan (1960), [https://archive.org/stream/Sarvepalli.Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life/Radhakrishnan-Brahma.Sutra-The.Philosophy.of.Spiritual.Life#page/n361/mode/2up Brahmasutras: the philosophy of spiritual life], George Allen, pages 363-365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma |title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=978-0-271-03946-6 |pages=30–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verse 2.1.34 of ''Brahma Sutras'' asserts that inequality and cruelty in the world cannot be attributed to the concept of [[Brahman]], and this is in the Vedas and the Upanishads. In his interpretation and commentary on the ''Brahma Sutras'', the 8th-century scholar Adi Shankara states that just because some people are happier than others and just because there is so much malice, cruelty and pain in the world, some state that Brahman cannot be the cause of the world.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Shankara attributes evil and cruelty in the world to [[Karma]] of oneself, of others, and to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge,&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt; but not to the abstract Brahman.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Shankara develops the argument that God is not the Brahman, and that "a loving and good God could not have created the universe", a position held by Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p23&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma |title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=978-0-271-03946-6 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain. Thus on account of the possibility of partiality and cruelty, God is not an agent.
|[[Adi Shankara]]|Translated by Arvind Sharma&lt;ref name=sharma2008p23/&gt;}}

In other words, in the ''Brahma Sutras'', the formulation of problem of evil is considered a metaphysical construct, but not a moral issue.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt; [[Ramanuja]] of the theistic [[Sri Vaishnavism]] school – a major tradition within Vaishnavism – interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt;

According to Swami Gambhirananda, Sankara's commentary explains that God cannot be charged with partiality or cruelty (i.e. injustice) on account of his taking the factors of virtuous and vicious actions (Karma) performed by an individual in previous lives. If an individual experiences pleasure or pain in this life, it is due to virtuous or vicious action (Karma) done by that individual in a past life &lt;ref name=Gambhirananda1965&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Gambhirananda |title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya Of Shankaracharya |url=https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Shankaracharya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 |year=1965|publisher=Vedanta Press &amp; Bookshop |isbn=978-8175051058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Ramanuja]] of the theistic [[Sri Vaishnavism]] school interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities.&lt;ref name="sradha30"/&gt; According to Arvind Sharma, Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] school does not attribute the evil and suffering to the abstract concept of Brahman, but to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge.&lt;ref name="sharma2008p31"/&gt; The universe and all existence is without a beginning or end, and Brahman is everything before and after that beginning, before and after the end.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Further, in Hindu thought, neither evil nor error are final, all happiness and suffering is impermanent, and truth ultimately triumphs.&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt;

==Karma doctrine and the problem of evil==
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454-455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530-548&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P. Bilimoria (2007), Karma’s suffering: A Mimamsa solution to the problem of evil, in Indian Ethics (Editors: Bilimoria et al.), Volume 1, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pp. 171-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Kumarila’s ‘‘Slokavarttika’’; for English translation of parts and discussions: P. Bilimoria (1990), ‘ Hindu doubts about God - Towards a Mimamsa Deconstruction’, International Philosophical Quarterly, 30(4), pp. 481-499&lt;/ref&gt; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in ''Sribhasya''.&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013/&gt;

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–255&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347-364&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P. Bilimoria (2013), Toward an Indian Theodicy, in The Blackwell Companion to the Problem of Evil (Editors: McBrayer and Howard-Snyder), 1st Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-0470671849}}, Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions.&lt;ref&gt;G.

==Dvaita tradition of Vaishnavism==
One sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}} [[Madhvacharya]] was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic [[Dvaita Vedanta]] (''Tattvavada'') theory that proposed [[God]] (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls ([[jiva|jīvātman]]) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R. Dasti and Edwin F. Bryant| title=Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|year = 2014| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0199922758| pages=270–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371}}

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371, '''Quote:''' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

'''Social philosophy''' is the study of questions about [[social behavior]] and interpretations of [[society]] and social [[institutions]] in terms of [[Value (ethics)|ethical values]] rather than empirical relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/social%20philosophy | title=Definition of SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social philosophers place new emphasis on understanding the social contexts for political, legal, moral, and cultural questions, and to the development of novel theoretical frameworks, from social ontology to care ethics to cosmopolitan theories of democracy, human rights, gender equity and global justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9833/homepage/ProductInformation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==
There is often a considerable overlap between the questions addressed by social philosophy and [[ethics]] or [[value theory]].  Other forms of social philosophy include [[political philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], which are largely concerned with the societies of [[State (polity)|state]] and [[government]] and their functioning.

Social philosophy, ethics, and political philosophy all share intimate connections with other disciplines in the [[social sciences]].  In turn, the social sciences themselves are of focal interest to the [[philosophy of social science]].

The [[philosophy of language]] and [[social epistemology]] are subfields which overlap in significant ways with social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialphilosophy.yolasite.com/|title=Social Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Cavite State University Main Campus|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spaltklang''' (literally: ''split sound'') is a term in [[music theory]]. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an [[instrumental piece]]. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.

Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in [[New Music]] such as [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s [[Histoire du soldat]]. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ed instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the [[string section]], for instance, only [[violin]] and [[double bass]] are represented, while [[viola]] and [[cello]] are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.

Moreover, the term appears in connection with [[multiphonics]].

The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of [[organ building]]. Here, it refers to organs that have [[Register (phonology)|registers]] with very different and distinct [[timbres]]. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a [[root note]]. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the [[Renaissance]] period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.

{{refimprove|date=August 2008}}
A '''spoiler''' is an element of a disseminated summary or description of any piece of [[fiction]] that reveals any [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, the details of the conclusion of the plot, including the climax and ending, are especially regarded as spoiler material. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer would not want to know beforehand. Because enjoyment of fiction depends a great deal upon the suspense of revealing plot details through standard narrative progression, the prior revelation of how things will turn out can "spoil" the enjoyment that some consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced. Spoilers can be found in message boards, articles, reviews, commercials, and movie trailers.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==On the Internet==
The term spoiler was introduced in the early days of the Internet, and came to prominence in [[newsgroup]] conversations. It is still common in [[internet]] articles and [[social media]] discussions. Early rules of [[netiquette]] insisted that spoilers could and should be normally avoided, but if the posting of "spoiling" information was unavoidable, it be preceded by a warning such as "SPOILER ALERT", or the spoiler itself has to be masked so that it can not be visible to any but those keen for details and not fazed at the thought of such potentially plot-revealing information.

Sometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately (see below), and some unwitting readers have had [[literature]], [[film]]s, [[television]] programmes and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing "spoiled".&lt;ref name=howsoon&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Jicha |url=http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |title=How soon is too soon for spoilers? |date=2009-01-23 |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |accessdate=2016-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203105208/http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common demand, especially among internet users, to have protection against accidentally seeing material considered to include "spoiler" information, even in the internet version of settings where such material has conventionally and historically appeared, such as discussion groups or literary reviews. As a result of this level of objection to spoilers, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]] may post them purely for their own pleasure, finding amusement in believing they are completely ruining a narrative experience for others. On reputable websites, these can be reported to [[forum moderator|moderators]] and such posts taken down, the posters blacklisted, but only after the fact. Most such websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Some{{who|date=January 2016}} have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up "closed" websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.

On [[Usenet]], the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as 'spoiler space' – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line [[Dumb terminal|terminal]]. A simple cipher called [[ROT13]] is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.

Some producers actively seed bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' orchestrated a "disinformation campaign" where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.&lt;ref name=foilers&gt;{{cite news | author = Hugh Hart | url = https://www.wired.com/2009/01/new-lost-season | title = Spoiler Wars Heat Up as Lost Returns | date = 2009-01-21 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning, although it previously did prior to 2006. Matthew Prichard, the grandson of [[Agatha Christie]], criticized Wikipedia for giving away spoilers in the play "The Mousetrap". Andrew Jarecki, the producer of ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]'', a documentary, argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts. The plot of ''Catfish'' had been posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film had been shown at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]]. Jay Walsh, a [[Wikimedia Foundation]] spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is intended to be an exhaustive knowledge source, so it would have spoilers.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Noam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/business/media/18spoiler.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1284931453-Cougj2fpRsBoD+tJX2gG5g Spoiler Alert: Whodunit? Wikipedia Will Tell You]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 17, 2010. Retrieved on August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some internet forums and reference sites, such as [[TV Tropes]] and the [[IMDb]] FAQ section, have optional spoiler tags covering major plot details. The information underneath may be revealed by highlighting the text or, in the case of IMDb, rolling over the spoiler tag.

In 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story "spoiled" enjoyed the story more than the subjects who didn't know the ending in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer, Jonah. "[https://www.wired.com/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don't Spoil Anything]." ''[[Wired (magazine)]]''. August 10, 2011. Retrieved on October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some applications that prevent users from reading spoilers, such as [[TVShow Time]]'s [[Google Chrome extension]], which, once set up, blocks posts on [[social media]] about episodes that the user has not seen.

==In print or other media==
One of the first print uses of the terms was in the April 1971 issue of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |title=National Lampoon Issue #14 |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Table of Contents |date=April 1971 |publisher=[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207072228/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article entitled "Spoilers," by [[Doug Kenney]], lists spoilers for famous films and movies.

[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Ebert]] in 2007]]
In 2005, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote an article entitled "Critics have no right to play spoiler" which contained spoilers and spoilers warnings.&lt;ref name="CST01"/&gt; Ebert wrote:

:The characters in movies do not always do what we would do. Sometimes they make choices that offend us. That is their right. It is our right to disagree with them. It is not our right, however, to destroy for others the experience of being as surprised by those choices as we were. A few years ago, I began to notice "spoiler warnings" on Web-based movie reviews -- a shorthand way of informing the reader that a key plot point was about to be revealed. Having heard from more than a few readers accusing me of telling too much of the story, I began using such warnings in my reviews.

Ebert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying "If you have not yet seen ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' and know nothing about the plot, read no further" and later said, "Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit." Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled ''[[The Crying Game]]'' and also noted a detail about the film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. Ebert also mentioned two films alongside ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''.&lt;ref name="CST01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050129/COMMENTARY/501290301 |title=Critics have no right to play spoiler |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Roger Ebert |date=2005-01-29 |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebert additionally criticized two commentators, [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Michael Medved]] (the latter of whom had "for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic"), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character's life decision. "[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?" Ebert asked. "The [[separation of church and state]] in [[United States of America|America]] was wisely designed to prevent [[religions]] from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs."&lt;ref name="CST01" /&gt;

In an interview about his ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 [[Marvel Comic]] adaptation ''[[The Gunslinger Born]]''), [[Stephen King]] was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone's experience of the comic. "There are no spoilers!", King replied, "You might as well say 'I'm never gonna watch ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' again because I know how it comes out'".

The executive producer of ''Doctor Who'', [[Steven Moffat]], expressed disappointment with fans who revealed spoilers after a leaked copy of "The Impossible Astronaut" was made available online before the episode's first television broadcast.

In April 2015, the [[Under the Gun Theater]] created ''Swarm of Spoilers'', a parody show based on [[George R.R. Martin]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the [[HBO]] television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed ''Swarm of Spoilers'', stated: "I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title," though he went on to say, "There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [''Swarm of Spoilers'']." &lt;!-- Is this referring to Christenfeld &amp; Leavitt, 2011? --&gt; The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]].&lt;ref name="Redeye Purdom"&gt;Purdom, Gwendolyn [http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/theater/redeye-swarm-of-spoilers-game-of-thrones-chicago-20150331-story.html Under the Gun Theater produces on 'Game of Thrones' parody show].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">'''Stable-isotope probing''' ('''SIP''') is a technique in [[microbial ecology]] for tracing fluxes of [[nutrient]]s in [[biogeochemical cycling]] by microorganisms. A substrate is enriched with a heavier [[stable isotope]] that is consumed by the organisms to be studied. [[Biomarkers]] with the heavier isotope incorporated into them can be separated from biomarkers containing the more naturally abundant lighter isotope by [[isopycnic centrifugation]]. For example, [[isotopes of carbon|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]][[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be used to find out which organisms are actively [[photosynthesizing]] or consuming new photosynthate. As the biomarker, [[DNA]] with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is then separated from DNA with &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C by centrifugation. [[DNA sequencing|Sequencing]] the DNA identifies which organisms were consuming existing [[carbohydrates]] and which were using carbohydrates more recently produced from photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=radajeweksi&gt;{{cite journal |last= Radajewski|first= Stefan|last2= Ineson|first2= Philip|last4= Murrell|first4= Colin|last3= Parekh|first3= Nisha R.|date= 2000|title= Stable-isotope probing as a tool in microbial ecology|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6770/abs/403646a0.html|journal= Nature|publisher= |volume= 403|issue= 6770|pages= 646–649|doi= 10.1038/35001054|accessdate=29 May 2014|pmid=10688198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When DNA is the biomarker, SIP theoretically can be performed using isotopically labeled C, H, O or N, though &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is used most often.  Cupples et al. (2007) demonstrated a weaker DNA buoyant density shift in when &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N- versus &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled substrates were used in pure culture, conversely a very strong buoyant density shift was observed when both labels were used.&lt;ref&gt;Cupples, A.M., E.A. Shaffer, J.C. Chee-Sanford, and G.K. Sims.  2007.  DNA buoyant density shifts during 15N DNA stable isotope probing.  Microbiological Res. 162:328-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Ne le méritoit pas!  Moi?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE:                      Vous.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE:                                  Ton impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Téméraire viellard, aura son récompense.  [''Il lui donne un soufflet''
&lt;ref&gt;
COUNT: What I deserved, you carried away.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who won it over you had deserved it more.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: You had it by intrigue, being an old courtier.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The luster of my high deeds was my only supporter.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: And by that the honor was owed to my arm only.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: He who could not obtain it did not deserve it.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT: Did not deserve it!  I?&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO:                      You.&lt;br&gt;
COUNT:                                  Your impudence,&lt;br&gt;
Rash old man, will have its reward.  [''He slaps him'']
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''United States v. Morgan''''', 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which provides the writ of [[coram nobis]] as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration.

==Background==
The ancient writ of [[coram nobis]] originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error.  The writ of coram nobis was identical to the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]]; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] provided courts in the United States the authority to issue [[writ|writs]] to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a) and is known as the [[All Writs Act|“all-writs section of the Judicial Code”]].) In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 60|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus.  Thus, in its 1947 decision, ''United States v. Smith'', the Supreme Court observed “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898|title=''United States v. Smith'', 331 US 469, 475 n.4 (1947)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration.  Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

''Morgan'' resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis.  Although the Supreme Court states in ''Carlisle v. United States'', “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985|title=''Carlisle v. United States'', 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgan'' provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in-custody.

==Case==
In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan’s [[constitutional right|constitutional rights]] were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York’s Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]].

In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan’s petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court’s decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11147499741758364560|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 202 F.2d 67, 69 (1953)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appellate court’s decision, the attorney’s office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morgan'', 345 U. S. 974 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]''United States v. Morgan'' was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) syllabus|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Forman Reed|Justice Stanley Reed]] wrote for the majority in ''Morgan'', which held:
* Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis. ''id.'' at 506-510.
* A motion for a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and “is of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” ''id.'' at 505, n.4.
* A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. ''id.'' at 511.
* If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court. ''id.'' at 512.
* Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.  ''id.'' at 512-513.
* The writ of coram nobis may be issued to correct a constitutional violation. ''id.'' at 512-513.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954)|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Morgan'' broadened the writ of coram nobis, which had historically been issued only to correct [[question of fact|errors of fact]], to allow courts to also correct [[question of law|errors of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18257773315166643768|title=''Hirabayashi v.

==Division of circuit courts==
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the United States Courts of Appeals]] Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court’s decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the ''Morgan'' decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and also “of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html#F4|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) footnote 4|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a "step in a criminal case." Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916|title=''United States v.

Recent history of changes in women's roles includes having [[women in the military]] in many countries.

==Africa==

=== Algeria ===
The presence of female soldiers in the Algerian army was of crucial importance during [[Women in the Algerian War|the Algerian revolution]] against colonial France, some of the most prominent figures and symbols of the National Liberation Front were female combatants. 

[[Fatima Zohra Ardjoune]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Par Mounir Kechar |url=http://www.algerlablanche.com/index.php?post/Pr-Fatima-Zohra-Ardjoune%2C-la-premi%C3%A8re-femme-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-de-l-arm%C3%A9e-alg%C3%A9rienne |title=Pr Fatima Zohra Ardjoune, la première femme général de l'armée algérienne - Alger La Blanche - Le Portail de l'Algérie |publisher=Alger La Blanche |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  director general of the Ain Naâdja military hospital, was promoted to general, the first woman in the Algerian People’s National Army (PNA)—and in the Arab world—to reach this rank. Three years later, Fatima Boudouani &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastobserver.org/2017/03/03/algerias-interest-in-world-security-stems-from-international-solidarity-principle-official/ |title=Algeria's interest in world security stems from international solidarity principle: Official |publisher=Middle East Observer |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the second woman to be promoted to the rank of general in the [[wikipedia:People's National Army (Algeria)|PNA]], and she was followed by three more women in 2015, therefore becoming the Arab country with the biggest number of high-ranking female army commanders. &lt;ref name="muftah1"&gt;https://muftah.org/women-in-the-algerian-military-then-and-now/#.WTtiP-s1_IU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2014/07/09/Algeria-appoints-four-female-army-generals-.html |title=Algeria appoints four female army generals |publisher=Al Arabiya English |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four generals were also promoted to the rank of major-general. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Algerian-woman-becomes-countrys-first-female-general |title=Algerian woman becomes country's first female general - Middle East - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2009-07-05 |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aardjoun's promotion reflects a growing trend of Algerian women taking more prominent positions in the workforce, most notably in the police and military. Algeria boasts the largest number of female police officers in the Muslim world. The status of women in the military had been made legally equal to that of men in an ordinance on February 28, 2006, and the military’s promotions of women from 2009 to 2015 broke an apparent taboo. The army has since put in place a formal policy framework for equal opportunities, and efforts have been made to apply it. &lt;ref name="muftah1"/&gt;

Since 2005, Bouteflika has been under pressure to enact more changes in favor of women’s rights. &lt;ref name="alarabiya1"/&gt;

===Eritrea===
Female soldiers in Eritrea played a large role in both the Eritrean civil war and the border dispute with Ethiopia, because they make up more than 30% of the Eritrean military. They also serve in direct combat operations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Libya===
A 200-strong unit was [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]'s personal bodyguard and is called variously the "Green Nuns" and "The Amazonian Guard" or more commonly in [[Libya]] [[The Revolutionary Nuns]] ({{lang-ar|الراهبات الثوريات}}) .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3052655.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0 TimesOnline: ''Adieu, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, a tricky guest''] Accessed 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[File:Africa Aerospace and Defense 2010 (5093447570).jpg|thumb|right|Female [[South African National Defence Force]] members speak with an American soldier during the [[Africa Aerospace and Defence]] expo in 2010.]]
South African women have a long history of service in the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) and in the modern [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF). In [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] women served in auxiliary roles in the [[South African Defence Force]] and were assigned to non-combat active roles after 1970. In 1914 a volunteer nursing service was established by the army and 328 nurses to serve with South African troops in [[Europe]] and [[East Africa]] in World War I. The Women's Auxiliary Army Service began accepting women recruits in 1916. Officials estimated that women volunteers relieved 12,000 men for combat in World War I by assuming clerical and other duties. During World War II, South Africa had five service organizations for women—the South African Military Nursing Service, and women's auxiliaries attached to the army, the navy, the air force, and the military police.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, women were active in civil defence organizations and were being trained as part of the country's general mobilization against possible terrorist attacks. In 1989, for example, the Johannesburg Civil Defence Program provided training for 800 civil defense volunteers, about one-half of whom were women. These classes included such subjects as weapons training for self-defense, antiriot procedures, traffic and crowd control, first aid, and fire-fighting. An unreported number of women also received instruction in counterinsurgency techniques and commando operations. Women also served in military elements of liberation militias in the 1970s and the 1980s, and women were accepted into the [[ANC]]'s military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation, also known as Umkhonto—MK), throughout the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid struggle]].

In 1995 women of all races were being incorporated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] (SANDF), and a woman officer, Brigadier Jackie Sedibe, was appointed to oversee the implementation of new SANDF policies concerning the treatment of women. Women had been promoted as high as warrant officers and brigadiers in the Permanent Force by the early 1990s, but only ten women were SADF colonels in 1994. In 1996 Brigadier Sedibe became the first woman in the military to be promoted to the rank of major general. Widespread cultural attitudes in the 1990s still oppose the idea of women in combat, but officials are debating ways to assign women an equitable share of the leadership positions in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/south_africa/south_africa-women_in_the_military_homeland_militaries.html|title=South Africa-Women in the Military Homeland Militaries|website=www.mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 almost 26.6% of the uniformed services of the South African National Defence Force consisted of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16708:fact-file-sandf-regular-force-levels-by-race-a-gender-april-30-2011-&amp;catid=79:fact-files&amp;Itemid=159|title=Fact file: SANDF regular force levels by race &amp; gender: April 30, 2011  - defenceWeb|first=Leon|last=Engelbrecht|website=www.defenceweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military of the Gambia]] have no gender conscription and women are free to volunteer for the armed forces. In 2011 the first female army general was decorated in [[the Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/gambias-first-female-army-general-decorated |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219015225/http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/gambias-first-female-army-general-decorated |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }} Accessed 29 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Women in the Australian military}}
[[File:Able Seaman Maritime Logistics-Support Operations Codie-Lee Reid on HMAS Canberra at RIMPAC 2016.jpg|thumb|A female member of {{HMAS|Canberra|LHD 02|6}}'s crew in 2016]]
All roles in the Australian Defence Force are open to women. The first women became involved with the Australian armed forces with the creation of the Army Nursing Service in 1899. On the 30th of June 2017, women were found to make up 16.5% of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (with 20.6% in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], 20.4% in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and 13.2% in the [[Australian Army]]).&lt;ref name="Women in the ADF Report 2016-2017"&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/annualreports/16-17/Downloads/WomenInTheADFReport2016-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, up until 2016, only 74% of the total number of available roles in the Australian armed forces were available to women. Despite this, using 1998-99 figures, the ADF had the highest percentage of women in its employ in the world.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/archive/womenarmed |title=Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force – Parliament of Australia |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Australia became the fourth nation in the world to allow women to serve on its submarines.

Australia was the fourth country to permit female crew on submarines, doing so in June 1998 on board [[Collins class submarine]]s. Australia's first deployment of female sailors in a combat zone was aboard [[HMAS Westralia (O 195)|HMAS ''Westralia'']] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].

On 27 September 2011, Defence Minister Stephen Smith announced that women will be allowed to serve in frontline combat roles by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-27/women-on-the-frontline/2946258|title=Women cleared to serve in combat|publisher=ABC News|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, allegations of alleged sexual harassment on board [[HMAS Swan (DE 50)|HMAS ''Swan'']] were investigated, and in 1998 similar allegations arose in the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]].

Some women served in various positions in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], including infantry, radio operators and transport pilots in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|1948 war of independence]] and the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, but later the Air Force closed its ranks to female pilots, and women were restricted from combat positions. There is a draft of both men and women. Most women serve in non-combat positions, and are conscripted for two years (instead of three years for men). A landmark high court appeal in 1994 forced the Air Force to accept women air cadets. In 2001, Israel's first female combat pilot received her wings. In 1999 the [[Caracal Battalion|Caracal]] company was formed, as a non segregated infantry company. In 2000 it was expanded into a Battalion (called The 33rd, for the 33 women killed in combat during the War of Independence) since then, further combat positions have opened to women, including Artillery, Field Intelligence, Search and Rescue, NBC, Border Patrol, K-9 Unit and anti-aircraft warfare.

On May 26, 2011, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Chief of Staff [[Benny Gantz]] announced Brigadier General [[Orna Barbivay]]'s appointment as the next Head of the IDF Personnel Directorate. Barbivay was promoted to [[Major General]], thus becoming the most senior female officer in the history of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].

===Japan===
[[File:Jsdf-候補生（新隊員前期）.jpg|thumb|Female candidates of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (2011).]]
When the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF), postwar armed forces of [[Japan]], was originally formed, women were recruited exclusively for the nursing services. Opportunities were expanded somewhat when women were permitted to join the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF; army) communication service in 1967, the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF; navy) and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF; air force) communication services in 1974. By 1991, more than 6,000 women were in the JSDF, about 80% of service areas, except those requiring direct exposure to combat, were open to them. The National Defense Medical College graduated its first class with women in March 1991, and the [[National Defense Academy of Japan]] began admitting women in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Focus|url=http://japanfocus.org/-Fumika-Sato/3820|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no restrictions on roles for women in the [[New Zealand Defence Force]].

This came into effect in 2001 by subordinate legislation, with a report in 2005 finding that the move helped drive a societal shift that "values women as well as men" but that integration of women into combat roles "needed a deliberate and concerted effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130125-women-combat-world-australia-israel-canada-norway/|title=8 Other Nations That Send Women to Combat|date=25 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{Main|Women in the Philippine military}}
From 1993 onward, women served only in [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]] of [[Philippine military]]. In 1993, women were granted the right to serve as combat soldiers with the passage of Republic Act No. 7192 and the first batch started the training in the [[Philippine Military Academy]] in April that year.

===Saudi Arabia===

Applications for certain non-combat roles were opened to women in February, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43197048|title=Saudi Arabia allows women to join army|date=26 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Singapore allows women to serve in combat roles, although females are not conscripted.

===Sri Lanka===
[[Sri Lanka Air Force]] (SLAF) was the first service of the Sri Lankan military to allow women to serve, accepting female recruits to the [[Sri Lanka Volunteer Air Force]] in 1972. The Sri Lanka Army followed in 1979 with the establishment of the [[Sri Lanka Army Women's Corps]] (SLAWC). Since then, each service has for both administrative and practical reasons maintained separate units for women. These are the SLAWC and the SLAF Women's Wing; the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] does not have a specific name for women's units. In order to maintain discipline, all three services have women [[Military police|MPs]] attached to their respective military police/provost corps.

Currently, female personnel of all three services play an active part in ongoing operations. However, there are certain limitations in 'direct combat' duties such as [[special forces]], pilot branch, naval fast attack squadrons. These are only a few restrictions; female personnel have been tasked with many front line duties and attached to combat units such as [[paratroops]], [[Sri Lanka Air Force Regiment|SLAF Regiment]], as well as undertaken support services such as [[Control tower|control tower operators]], [[Electronic warfare|electronic warfare technicians]], radio material teletypewriters, [[Auto mechanic|automotive mechanics]], [[Assault Support|aviation supply personnel]], [[cryptographers]], [[physician|doctors]], [[combat medic]]s, [[lawyers]], [[Combat engineering|engineers]] and [[Aerial photography|aerial photographers]]. In the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] female personnel were at first limited to the medical branch, however currently both lady officers and female rates are able to join any branch of service including the executive branch. With the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]], many female personnel have come under enemy fire both directly and indirectly thus taking many casualties including fatalities. As of 2008 there were three female officers of the rank of [[Major General]] and one [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]].

The [[Department of Civil Defence (Sri Lanka)|Sri Lanka Civil Defence Force]], formerly the Sri Lanka Home Guard, has been open to women recruits since 1988. In 1993, these guardswomen were issued firearms and deployed to protect their home towns and villages against attacks by [[LTTE]]. As a result, there have been many casualties (including fatalities) from attacks.

===Thailand===
Thailand has recently begun recruiting and training women to conduct counter-insurgency operations (c. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/03/18/thailand.women.ap/ | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ranger commander said that when women are protesting, "It is better for women to do the talking. Male soldiers look tough and aggressive. When women go and talk, people tend to be more relaxed".

=== United Arab Emirates ===

The UAE hosts the Gulf region’s first military college for women, Khawla Bint Al Azwar Military School has been open since 1991 under the late [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]]. Females were granted the same training and responsibilities as their male counterparts, and also play a major role in humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations. Emirati women have reached senior ranks within the [[UAE Armed Forces]], especially in the Air Force combat units. A great example of the achievements of Emirati women is Major [[Mariam al-Mansouri]], The first female fighter pilot in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and the [[Arab World]]. She made international headlines for leading the UAE's mission to fight ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/emirati-woman-who-reached-for-the-skies|title=Emirati woman who reached for the skies ... {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/uae-women-prove-competency-in-military-1.1045873|title=UAE women prove competency in military|last=WAM|date=2012-07-08|website=GulfNews|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-armed-forces-women-honoured|title=UAE Armed Forces women honoured {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, women were had the choice to be conscripted provided they have their parents’ consent. Military service is for 9 months and is optional for women aged 18 to 30 and is mandatory for men aged between 18 and 30 and is for 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395268672475.html|title=Khawla Bint Al Azwar Military School is ready to welcome female conscripts {{!}} WAM|website=www.wam.ae|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Denmark===
Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962, the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998, laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Since then females have served in infantry units in both Iraq and in combat in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorensjogren.com/2012/the-problem-with-women-in-combat-units/|title=HugeDomains.com - SoreNsJogRen.com is for sale (Sore Ns Jog Ren)|website=sorensjogren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm|title=NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010, women make up 5% of the army, 6.9% of the navy, and 8.6% of air force personnel.

===Finland===
[[File:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Red Guard during the [[Finnish Civil War]]]]

The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Women generally serve under the same conditions as men.

[[File:Lottia ilmavalvontatehtävissä.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Lotta Svärd]] in air control duty during the [[Continuation War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. Since 1995 the women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces both in Finland and in operations outside Finland.

===France===
[[File:Cantiniere1800s.jpg|thumb|A [[Cantinière]] with a male infantry soldier in Algeria, around 1845. Painting by Edouard Moreau.]]

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[cantinière]]s. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wars of the French Revolution]], some women enlisted in the army, mainly in support roles. [[Angélique Brûlon|Marie-Angélique Duchemin]] is the first woman with a recorded rank in the French Army, being promoted Corporal and Acting Sergeant in 1794. She was promoted 2nd Lieutenant on the retired list in 1815. Duchemin is the first woman decorated with the [[Legion of Honor]], in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/biographies/files/duchemin_delage_2007.asp fondation Napoléon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. [[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981.


Today women can serve in every position in the French military, including submarines&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rfi.fr/france/20171204-France-have-its-first-women-submariners-mission France have its first women submariners on mission], [[Radio France International]], december 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and combat infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/france/20150223-journee-internationale-femme-militaire-commando-parachutiste-8-mars-defense A l'armée, une femme est un homme comme les autres], Radio France international, march 2015 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; make up around 15% of all service personnel in the combined branches of the French military. They are 11% of the Army forces, 13% for the Navy, 21% of the Air Force and 50% of the Medical Corps. This is the highest proportion of female personnel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes de la Defense|url=https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/487432/7798345/version/1/file/Les+femmes+dans+larmee+francaise-diptyque.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Defense, Government of France|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in Luftwaffe artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/combat.pdf D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''Generalarzt''. But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]].

There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are woman serving in the "Fallschirmjäger" and as Tornado fighter pilot.

===Ireland===
In the Irish [[1916 Rising]], Cumann na mBan, the women's wing of the Irish Volunteers, fought alongside them in the streets of Dublin and in the General Post Office, the Irish Volunteers' HQ. [[Constance Markievicz]], an Irish Revolutionary and suffragette, commanded male and female troops during the Rising.

The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979, making them the first European Armed Forces to allow women all roles in the military including combat roles, and even join the Irish Army Ranger Wing (Fianoglach), the Irish Special Forces, similar to the British SAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html |title=Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1979-11-06 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html |title=Dáil Éireann - Volume 658 - 02 July, 2008 - Written Answers. - Defence Forces Personnel |publisher=Historical-debates.oireachtas.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During the short life of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (World War II), the Female Volunteer Unit was introduced as an auxiliary service and they were knwown as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in Southern Italy during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the Naval Academy of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started her struggle to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66 which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but the State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When she became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/|title=Italiane in armi|date=5 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm|title=Servizio militare femminile|website=www.informagiovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to join the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3|title=L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx|title=Ministero della Difesa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and ''Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM''. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno|title=235° Reggimento Addestramento Volontari|website=www.esercito.difesa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Women in Norway have been able to fill military roles since 1938, and during the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join them in 1959. Female personnel currently make up around 12% of the armed forces (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forsvaret.no/en/facts/the-armed-forces-in-numbers/personnel|title=Personnel|first=|last=Forsvaret|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military.

In 1995, Norway allowed women to serve on its military [[submarines]], and to this date there has been at least one female commander of a Norwegian submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2002/issue4/english/interview.html|title=Nato Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was [[Solveig Krey]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.no/fakta/start/menneskene/kvinner/ |title=Forsvarsnett: Kvinner |publisher=Mil.no |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 conscription was extended to women making Norway the first [[NATO]] member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |title=Universal Conscription |publisher=Norwegian Armed Forces |date=11 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005856/https://forsvaret.no/en/newsroom/news-stories/female-conscription |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Zolnierki 1920.JPG|thumb|175px|Polish female volunteers during the [[Polish-Soviet War]]]]
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army|People's Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm |title=Women in Home Army |publisher=Polishresistance-ak.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college nursing or veterinary degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools. Two active duty Polish women have achieved the rank of Colonel. [[Maria Wittek]] was the 1st Polish woman to reach the rank of General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army – in Polish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104013702/http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Kobiety w Wojsku Polskim|in Polish]], Retrieved 2013-11-14{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===

[[File:Regiment from Petrograd.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Women's Battalion#1st Petrograd Women's Battalion|1st Petrograd Women's Battalion]] (1918)]]
[[File:Military parade on Red Square 2017-05-09 028.jpg|thumb|Russian female cadets.]]
During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm |title=Women's Death Battalion |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) until December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.

===Serbia===
  {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian armed forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]], the most decorated female combatant in history. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

===Sweden===
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female personnel currently make up around 13% of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Armed Forces http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/om-myndigheten/vara-varderingar/jamstalldhet-och-jamlikhet/historik/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Besides providing nursery services, women also took main roles in combat in WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913011056/http://www.haznevi.net/Kavramoku.aspx?KID=589&amp;KTID=6 |archivedate=2014-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html |title=Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armor, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:The Auxiliary Territorial Service in the United Kingdom 1939 - 1945 H36315.jpg|thumb|right| ATS Searchlight Unit in the Second World War]]
Women were first employed by the [[Royal Navy]] in 1696 when a handful were employed as nurses and [[laundress]]es on [[hospital ship]]s.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; They received pay equal to an [[Able Seaman (rank)|able seaman]].&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; The practice was always controversial and over the next two centuries first the nurses and the laundresses were removed from service.&lt;ref name=stark68 /&gt; By the start of the 19th century both roles had been eliminated.&lt;ref name=stark68&gt;{{cite book |title=Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail |last=Stark |first=Suzanne J. |year=1998 |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-6660-2 |pages=68–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Female service in the Royal Navy restarted 1884 when the Naval Nursing Service was formed. It became the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service]] in 1902 and is still in operation. Women have had active roles in the British Army since 1902, when the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]] was founded.  The [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] was formed in 1918. During the Second World War, about 600,000 women served in the three British women's auxiliary services: the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]], the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], and the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]], as well as the nursing corps.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Milks, ''Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the [[Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was formed; 47,000 women served until it was disbanded in 1921.  The [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed in 1917 as well. Before it disbanded in 1919, it provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

In 1938, the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during World War II, including as [[military police]]. They also performed a combat role on British soil, as [[anti-aircraft gun]]ners against the [[Luftwaffe]]. 

In 1949, women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still restricted to men. In this year, the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]] was created to replace the ATS, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army. From 1949 to 1992, thousands of women served in the WRAC and sister institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Goldman, ed. ''Female Soldier: Combatants or Non-Combatants?

===Canada===
[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada's part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]].

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. In 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada's first female infantry soldier, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1989, a tribunal appointed under the Canadian Human Rights Act ordered full integration of women in the Canadian Armed Forces "with all due speed", at least within the next ten
years. Only submarines were to remain closed to women.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Symons, "Under Fire: Canadian Women in Combat," ''Canadian Journal of Women and the Law'' (1990) 4: 477–511&lt;/ref&gt;
Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first [[Submarine#Women|female submariner]] in 2003.

Canadian women have also commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships. Commander Josée Kurtz is the first woman appointed to command a major warship –  [[HMCS Halifax (FFH 330)|HMCS Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=canadian-armed-forces-historical-milestones-of-women/hie8w7rl|title=National Defence - Canadian Armed Forces - Fact Sheet - Canadian Armed Forces – Historical milestones of women|first=Government of Canada, National|last=Defence|website=www.forces.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman.

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman.

In the history of women in the military, there are records of female U.S. Revolutionary and Civil War soldiers who enlisted using male pseudonyms, but a letter written by [[Annie Oakley]] to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. Oakley, sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] [[Wild West Shows|Show]], wrote a letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html |title=Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley |last=Oakley |first=Oakley |authorlink=Annie Oakley |date=5 April 1898 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish–American War]] did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted.

During [[World War I]], 21,498 U.S. Army nurses (military nurses were all women then) served in military hospitals in the United States and overseas. Eighteen African-American Army nurses served stateside caring for German prisoners of war ([[POWs]]) and African-American soldiers; after the Armistice, Nov. 11, 1918, they entered the Army Nurse Corps and cared for people. They were assigned to [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant, IL]], and [[Camp Sherman, Ohio|Camp Sherman, OH]], and lived in segregated quarters while caring for German POWs and black soldiers. African-American women also served in World War I as U.S. Yeomen (F). Of the 11,274 U.S. Yeomen (F) who served from 1917 to 1921, 14 were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women's Roles and Statuses the World Over |author1=Stephanie Hepburn|author2=Rita J.

The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in [[clerk (position)|clerical]] positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. The U.S. Army recruited and trained 233 female bilingual telephone operators to work at switchboards near the front in France and sent 50 skilled female stenographers to France to work with the Quartermaster Corps. The U.S. Navy enlisted 11,880 women as Yeomen (F) to serve stateside in shore billets and release sailors for sea duty. More than 1,476 U.S. Navy nurses served in military hospitals stateside and overseas. The U.S. Marine Corps enlisted 305 female Marine Reservists (F) to "free men to fight" by filling positions such as clerks and telephone operators on the home front. More than 400 U.S. military nurses died in the line of duty during World War I. The vast majority of these women died from a highly contagious form of influenza known as the "[[Spanish Flu]]", which swept through crowded military camps and hospitals and ports of embarkation. Women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/WomenChronology.asp|title=Women's History Chronology|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Highlights in the History of Military Women |url= http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |accessdate= 2011-03-11 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034939/http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|title=Women in the military — international|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |publisher=CBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014025906/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=October 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Women's Army Corps|Woman’s Army Auxiliary Corps]], the women's branch of the United States Army, was established in the United States on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554, and converted to full status as the WAC on 1 July 1943. The [[WAVES|Woman’s Naval Reserve]] was also created during [[World War II]]. In 1944 women from the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WACs) arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations, and commendations. Additionally, by the end of WW II, Women Ordnance Workers (WOWs) accounted for approximately 85,000 of all civilian employees, working for the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goordnance.army.mil/history/ORDhistory.html|title=History of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps|website=www.goordnance.army.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordnance soldiers ''and'' civilians worked across the globe, ranging from Iceland, Iran, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and Europe, to the Middle East.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the [[Office of Strategic Services]], received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. The WAC as a branch was disbanded in 1978. Women serving as WACs at that time converted in branch to whichever [[Military Occupational Specialty]] they worked in.

U.S. servicewomen who had joined the Reserves following World War II were involuntarily recalled to active duty during the [[Korean War]]. More than 500 Army nurses served in the combat zone and many more were assigned to large hospitals in Japan during the war. One Army nurse (Major Genevieve Smith) died in a plane crash en route to Korea on July 27, 1950, shortly after hostilities begin. Navy nurses served on hospital ships in the Korean theater of war as well as at Navy hospitals stateside. Eleven Navy nurses died en route to Korea when their plane crashed in the Marshall Islands. Air Force nurses served stateside, in Japan, and as flight nurses in the Korean theater during the conflict. Three Air Force nurses were killed in plane crashes while on duty. Many other servicewomen were assigned to duty in the theater of operations in Japan and Okinawa.&lt;ref name="womensmemorial.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|title=Highlights in the History of Military Women|website=Women In Military Service For America Memorial|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html|archivedate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=scZN59DXeOwC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=%22genevieve+smith%22+%22korean+war%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22genevieve%20smith%22%20%22korean%20war%22&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |author=Paul M.

Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', {{ussc|411|677|1973}}, was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[United States Supreme Court]] case&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the case was decided under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause]], not under the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], since the latter applies not to the federal government but to the states. However, because ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', through the doctrine of reverse [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], made the standards of the Equal Protection Clause applicable to the federal government, it was for practical purposes an addition not to due process, but rather to equal protection jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that benefits given by the United States military to the family of service members cannot be given out differently because of sex.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots. The [[United States Congress|Congressionally]] mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Woman Decries Limitations |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933 |work=[[Star-Banner|Ocala Star-Banner]] |date=August 23, 1984 |at=vol. 40, no. 537, p. 8C|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Woman Aviator Pioneer Retires |editor-first=E.

On December 20, 1989, Captain Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women [[military police]] officers to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].

The 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] proved to be the pivotal time for the role of women in the United States Armed Forces to come to the attention of the world media. Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. However, while many came under fire, they were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Despite this, there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html |title=Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm |last1=Wilson |first1=Barbara A |publisher=American Women in Uniform, Veterans Too! |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the [[Virginia Military Institute]] allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting Judge [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/518/515/case.html ''United States v.

The [[Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011]] directed the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) to review the laws, policies and regulations restricting the service of female service members.

===Brazil===

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, only in 1943, during World War II, women officially entered the Brazilian Army.
They were sent 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army, all volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces.
After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

===Colombia===

Joanna Herrera Cortez became the first female Colombian fighter pilot in 2004. She also became a lieutenant and put in charge of 99 men.
