[[File:AB Portrait.jpg|thumb|Arnold Berleant]]
Arnold Berleant was born in Buffalo, New York&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics.  His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics.  Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of ''Contemporary Aesthetics'', an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.

==Life and work==

As a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts.  These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Renee Conroy, “Berleant Review,” (Philadelphia, PA:  American Society for Aesthetics, Eastern Division, April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  His first book, ''The Aesthetic Field:  A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience'' (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated.  Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment.  The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cheng Xiangzhan, “Environmental Aesthetics and Ecological Aesthetics:  Arnold Berleant’s Impact on Ecological Aesthetics in China,” Sztuka i Filozofia-Special Issue (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In Art and Engagement'' (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Aesthetics, Summer 1991.  p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality.  Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;
The body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience.  Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Feder-Marcus, Choice (American Library Association,  December, 1991), p. 255)&lt;/ref&gt;

AMG was a pioneering company with respect to talent management. Previously, powerful talent agencies were known more as large companies while management was handled more personally by smaller outfits. Now there are several companies, such as Management 360, [[Mosaic Media Group]], [[Untitled Entertainment]] and [[Steve Golin#Anonymous Content|Anonymous Content]], which function like AMG did.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The '''Budapest school''', or '''documentarism''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] film movement that flourished from roughly 1972 to 1984.  The movement originated from Béla Balázs Studios, a small-budget filmmaking community that aimed to unite the young [[avant-garde]] and [[underground film|underground]] filmmakers of Hungary and give them an opportunity to make experimental works without state censorship.  The Balázs studio gave birth to two main movements in the early 1970s: an experimental, avant-garde group (led by individuals like [[Gábor Bódy]]), and the documentarist group, whose main goal was the portrayal of absolute social-reality on screen. This movement was called "Budapest school" by an Italian film critic on a European film festival. Soon they adopted this name.

The main founders and leaders of the group were [[István Dárday]], [[Györgyi Szalai]], [[Judit Ember]] and [[Pál Schiffer]]. Many young and sometimes amateur artists were invited to the group by fellow filmmakers, especially [[Béla Tarr]], who made his debut film at the age of 22 with financing from the Béla Balázs Studios.

Films of the movement were generally (but not always) shot with amateur equipment, mostly hand-held cameras, and usually by two or more cameras at the same time. Non-professional actors, who most of the time socially resembled their characters, were cast.  These films also avoided pre-written scripts, with only a basic scenario and certain plot elements pre-written, and the cast members' reactions improvised on the set. Most films were shot in a very short period of time with a very limited budget or no budget at all. Their central themes were mostly the lives of working class and poor people in urban Hungary and their struggle to have a decent existence. The main goal of the movement was to show absolute reality on screen instead of the false escapism shown by commercial and mainstream films. 

The Budapest school movement closely resembled [[cinema verité]]. The first full-length film made in this manner was ''[[Jutalomutazás]]'' ("''The Prize Trip''") (1975) by István Dárday and Györgyi Szalai. The best-known example of the movement is "''[[Családi tűzfészek]]''" ("''Family Nest''") (1979) by Béla Tarr.

The '''code of non-infringement''' (or '''"the Code"''') is the accepted business practice and [[convention (norm)|custom]] among certain [[performance art]]ists, particularly [[clown]]s, that an artist's unique performance attributes are [[Property|proprietary]] and cannot be used or claimed by another. Among clowns, these attributes may include [[stage name]]s, costume elements, facial designs, and clown's specific [[joke]]s or "gags" and "bits".

'''Color vision''' is the ability of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequency|frequencies]]) of the [[light]] they [[reflected light|reflect]], [[Light emission|emit]], or [[Transmittance|transmit]]. [[Color]]s can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the [[brain]] responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of [[cone cell]]s in the [[eye]]. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.

==Wavelength and hue detection==
[[Isaac Newton]] discovered that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]], after being split into its component colours when passed through a [[dispersive prism]], could be recombined to make white light by passing them through a different prism. 

The characteristic colours are, from long to short wavelengths (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause a difference in the perceived [[hue]]; the [[just-noticeable difference]] in wavelength varies from about 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] in the [[blue-green]] and [[yellow]] wavelengths, to 10&amp;nbsp;nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure [[spectral color]]s are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] can be quite high.{{Ambiguous|date=October 2013}}

In very low light levels, vision is [[scotopic]]: light is detected by [[rod cell]]s of the [[retina]]. Rods are maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and play little, if any, role in colour vision. In brighter light, such as daylight, vision is [[photopic]]: light is detected by [[cone cell]]s which are responsible for colour vision. Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, but are most sensitive to wavelengths near 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Between these regions, [[mesopic vision]] comes into play and both rods and cones provide signals to the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s. The shift in colour perception from dim light to daylight gives rise  to differences known as the [[Purkinje effect]]

The perception of "white" is formed by the entire spectrum of visible light, or by mixing colours of just a few wavelengths in animals with few types of colour receptors. In humans, white light can be perceived by combining wavelengths such as red, green, and blue, or just a pair of [[complementary colour]]s such as blue and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;"Eye, human." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology of color perception==

[[File:Modern Color Vision Model.svg|thumb|The modern model of human color perception as it occurs in the retina, pertaining to both the [[trichromatic]] and [[opponent process]] theories introduced in the 19th century.]]

[[File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg|thumb|Normalized response spectra of human cones, to monochromatic spectral stimuli, with wavelength given in nanometers.]]

[[File:Spectrum locus 12.png|thumb|The same figures as above represented here as a single curve in three (normalized cone response) dimensions]]

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|[[Photopic]] relative brightness sensitivity of the human visual system as a function of wavelength ([[luminosity function]])]]

Perception of color begins with specialized retinal cells containing pigments with different [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]], known as [[cone cell]]s. In humans, there are three types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]].

Each individual cone contains pigments composed of [[opsin]] apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular Genetics of Human Color Vision: The Genes Encoding Blue, Green, and Red Pigments |first1=Jeremy |last1=Nathans |first2=Darcy |last2=Thomas |first3=David S. |last3=Hogness |journal=Science|date= April 11, 1986 |jstor=169687 |bibcode=1986Sci...232..193N |volume=232 |pages=193–202 |doi=10.1126/science.2937147 |pmid=2937147 |issue=4747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cones are conventionally labeled according to the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]]: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as we know them. Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina and it will be finalized in the [[visual cortex]] and associative areas of the brain.

For example, while the L cones have been referred to simply as [[red]] receptors, [[microspectrophotometry]] has shown that their peak sensitivity is in the greenish-yellow region of the spectrum. Similarly, the S- and M-cones do not directly correspond to [[blue]] and [[green]], although they are often described as such. The [[RGB color model]], therefore, is a convenient means for representing color, but is not directly based on the types of cones in the human eye.

The peak response of human cone cells varies, even among individuals with so-called normal color vision;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Neitz J, Jacobs GH |title=Polymorphism of the long-wavelength cone in normal human color vision |journal=Nature |volume=323 |issue=6089 |pages=623–5 |year=1986 |pmid=3773989 |doi=10.1038/323623a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |bibcode=1986Natur.323..623N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305161805/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
in some non-human species this polymorphic variation is even greater, and it may well be adaptive.{{technical_statement |date=May 2018 | Cited source doesn't mention adaptive color responses or sensitivity in the publically–available summary.  I can guess what “adaptive” describes in this context, but I could be incorrect, and therefore cannot clarify:  it could be photoreceptors which shift their sensitivity, or it could be visual processing which sees some colors more or less strongly. }}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacobs GH |title=Primate photopigments and primate color vision |journal=Proc.

===Theories===
Two complementary theories of color vision are the [[trichromatic theory]] and the [[opponent process]] theory. The trichromatic theory, or [[Young–Helmholtz theory]], proposed in the 19th century by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. [[Ewald Hering]] proposed the opponent process theory in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Zur Lehre vom Lichtsinne |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch–Naturwissenschaftliche Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=III Abtheilung |volume=LXVI.

Hof- und Staatsdruckerei in Commission bei C. Gerold's Sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white.  Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the adjacent diagram.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985p168&gt;Ali, M.A. &amp; Klyne, M.A. (1985), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Green&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Magenta and Blue&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In the same way that there cannot exist a "slightly negative" positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green.

A range of wavelengths of light stimulates each of these receptor types to varying degrees. Yellowish-green light, for example, stimulates both L and M cones equally strongly, but only stimulates S-cones weakly.  Red light, on the other hand, stimulates L cones much more than M cones, and S cones hardly at all; blue-green light stimulates M cones more than L cones, and S cones a bit more strongly, and is also the peak stimulant for rod cells; and [[blue]] light stimulates S cones more strongly than red or green light, but L and M cones more weakly. The brain combines the information from each type of receptor to give rise to different perceptions of different wavelengths of light.

The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X [[chromosome]]; defective encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of [[color blindness]]. The [[OPN1LW]] gene, which codes for the opsin present in the L cones, is highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants in a sample of 236 men).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Verrelli BC, Tishkoff SA |title=Signatures of Selection and Gene Conversion Associated with Human Color Vision Variation |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=363–75 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15252758 |pmc=1182016 |doi=10.1086/423287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A very small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. [[X chromosome inactivation]] means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of [[tetrachromat]]ic color vision.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Mark (2006). [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm "Some women may see 100 million colors, thanks to their genes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108171635/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm |date=2006-11-08 }} ''Post-Gazette.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in [[OPN1MW]], which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on [[spectral sensitivity]].

=== Color in the human brain ===
[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|left|Visual pathways in the human brain.  The [[ventral stream]] (purple) is important in color recognition.  The [[dorsal stream]] (green) is also shown.  They originate from a common source in the [[visual cortex]].]]

Color processing begins at a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz's trichromatic theory, and Hering's opponent process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises at the level of the receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of [[retinal ganglion cells]] and beyond.  In Hering's theory opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light–dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency, but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.

Visual information is then sent to the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the [[optic nerve]] to the [[optic chiasma]]: a point where the two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses to the other side of the brain. After the optic chiasma the visual tracts are referred to as the [[optic tract]]s, which enter the [[thalamus]] to synapse at the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).

The lateral geniculate nucleus is divided into laminae (zones), of which there are three types: the M-laminae, consisting primarily of M-cells, the P-laminae, consisting primarily of P-cells, and the koniocellular laminae.  M- and P-cells receive relatively balanced input from both L- and M-cones throughout most of the retina, although this seems to not be the case at the fovea, with midget cells synapsing in the P-laminae.  The koniocellular laminae receive axons from the small bistratified ganglion cells.&lt;ref name = "The First Steps in Seeing"&gt;R.W. Rodieck, "The First Steps in Seeing".

After [[Synapse|synapsing]] at the LGN, the visual tract continues on back to the primary [[visual cortex]] (V1) located at the back of the brain within the [[occipital lobe]]. Within V1 there is a distinct band (striation). This is also referred to as "striate cortex", with other cortical visual regions referred to collectively as "extrastriate cortex". It is at this stage that color processing becomes much more complicated.

In V1 the simple three-color segregation begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to some parts of the spectrum better than others, but this "color tuning" is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized "color cells" often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such "double-opponent" cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.158.3803.942 | title = Goldfish Retina: Organization for Simultaneous Color Contrast | author = Nigel W.

From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the "thin stripes" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4.

Anatomical studies have shown that neurons in extended V4 provide input to the inferior [[temporal lobe]] . "IT" cortex is thought to integrate color information with shape and form, although it has been difficult to define the appropriate criteria for this claim. Despite this murkiness, it has been useful to characterize this pathway (V1 &gt; V2 &gt; V4 &gt; IT) as the [[ventral stream]] or the "what pathway", distinguished from the [[dorsal stream]] ("where pathway") that is thought to analyze motion, among many other features.

=== Subjectivity of color perception ===
{{see also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Nothing categorically distinguishes the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from invisible portions of the broader spectrum.  In this sense, color is not a property of electromagnetic radiation, but a feature of visual perception by an observer.  Furthermore, there is an arbitrary mapping between wavelengths of light in the visual spectrum and human experiences of color.  Although most people are assumed to have the same mapping, the philosopher [[John Locke]] recognized that alternatives are possible, and described one such hypothetical case with the "[[inverted spectrum]]" thought experiment.  For example, someone with an inverted spectrum might experience green while seeing 'red' (700&amp;nbsp;nm) light, and experience red while seeing 'green' (530&amp;nbsp;nm) light.  [[Synesthesia]] (or [[ideasthesia]]) provides some atypical but illuminating examples of subjective color experience triggered by input that is not even light, such as sounds or shapes.  The possibility of a clean dissociation between color experience from properties of the world reveals that color is a subjective psychological phenomenon.

The [[Himba people]] have been found to categorize colors differently from most Euro-Americans and are able to easily distinguish close shades of green, barely discernible for most people.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, Davidoff, Davies &amp; Shapiro. referred by Debi Roberson, University of Essex 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Himba have created a very different color scheme which divides the spectrum to dark shades (''zuzu'' in Himba), very light (''vapa''),  vivid blue and green (''buru'') and dry colors as an adaptation to their specific way of life.

Perception of color depends heavily on the context in which the perceived object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as [[color constancy]].

=== In other animal species ===

Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet "colors" and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

The basis for this variation is the number of cone types that differ between species. Mammals in general have color vision of a limited type, and usually have [[red-green color blindness]], with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.

In most [[Catarrhini]] (Old World monkeys and apes—primates closely related to humans) there are three types of [[color receptors]] (known as [[cone cell]]s), resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]]. These primates, like humans, are known as [[Trichromacy|trichromats]]. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are [[dichromat]]s, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may have little or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ali|first=Mohamed Ather|last2=Klyne|first2=M.A.|title=Vision in Vertebrates|place=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1985|pages=174–175|isbn=0-306-42065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

Many [[invertebrate]]s have color vision. [[Honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet.

In the evolution of mammals, segments of color vision were lost, then for a few species of primates, regained by [[gene duplication]]. [[Eutherian]] mammals other than primates (for example, dogs, mammalian farm animals) generally have less-effective two-receptor ([[dichromat]]ic) color perception systems, which distinguish blue, green, and yellow—but cannot distinguish oranges and reds. There is some evidence that a few mammals, such as cats, have redeveloped the ability to distinguish longer wavelength colors, in at least a limited way, via one-amino-acid mutations in opsin genes.&lt;ref&gt;Shozo Yokoyamaa and F. Bernhard Radlwimmera, "The Molecular Genetics of Red and Green Color Vision in Mammals", Genetics, Vol. 153, 919–932, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptation to see reds is particularly important for primate mammals, since it leads to identification of fruits, and also newly sprouting reddish leaves, which are particularly nutritious.

However, even among primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, including monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. [[New World monkeys]] may or may not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs G.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Evolution of color vision}}
Color perception mechanisms are highly dependent on evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent is thought to be satisfactory recognition of food sources. In [[herbivorous]] primates, color perception is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In [[hummingbird]]s, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, [[nocturnal]] mammals have less-developed color vision, since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that [[ultraviolet]] light plays a part in color perception in many branches of the [[animal|animal kingdom]], especially [[insect]]s.  In general, the optical spectrum encompasses the most common [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transitions]] in matter and is therefore the most useful for collecting information about the environment.

== Mathematics of color perception ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016 }}
A "physical color" is a combination of pure [[spectral color]]s (in the visible range).  Since there are, in principle, infinitely many distinct spectral colors, the set of all physical colors may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional [[vector space]], in fact a [[Hilbert space]].  We call this space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;. More technically, the space of physical colors may be considered to be the (mathematical) [[cone (topology)|cone]] over the [[simplex]] whose vertices are the spectral colors, with white at the [[centroid]] of the simplex, black at the apex of the cone, and the monochromatic color associated with any given vertex somewhere along the line from that vertex to the apex depending on its brightness.

An element ''C'' of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; is a function from the range of visible wavelengths—considered as an interval of real numbers [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;]—to the real numbers, assigning to each wavelength ''w'' in [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] its intensity ''C''(''w'').

A humanly perceived color may be modeled as three numbers: the extents to which each of the 3 types of cones is stimulated. Thus a humanly perceived color may be thought of as a point in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. We call this space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since each wavelength ''w'' stimulates each of the 3 types of cone cells to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions ''s''(''w''), ''m''(''w''), ''l''(''w'') corresponding to the response of the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' cone cells, respectively.

Finally, since a beam of light can be composed of many different wavelengths, to determine the extent to which a physical color ''C'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to ''w''), over the interval [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;], of ''C''(''w'')·''s''(''w''), of ''C''(''w'')·''m''(''w''), and of ''C''(''w'')·''l''(''w''). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color ''C'' (which is an element in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the "physical" space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; can all result in the same single perceived color in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.

Thus human color perception is determined by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Technically, the image of the (mathematical) cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, by this linear mapping, is also a (mathematical) cone in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.  Moving directly away from the vertex of this cone represents maintaining the same [[chromaticity]] while increasing its intensity. Taking a cross-section of this cone yields a 2D chromaticity space.  Both the 3D cone and its projection or cross-section are convex sets; that is, any mixture of spectral colors is also a color.

[[File:Cie Chart with sRGB gamut by spigget.png|thumb|The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram with a triangle showing the [[gamut]] of the [[sRGB]] color space. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in [[kelvin]]s. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers (blue). Note that the colors in this file are being specified using '''sRGB'''. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered because they are out of the gamut of sRGB, therefore they have been interpreted. Note that the colors depicted depend on the color space of the device you use to view the image (number of colors on your monitor, etc.), and may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position.]]

In practice, it would be quite difficult to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them ''S'', ''M'', and ''L''. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' would have to be added with some intensity to the ''physical test color'', and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.

By considering all the resulting combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a subset of 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' had to be added to the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of "chromaticities" (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross section, corresponding to constant ''X''+''Y''+''Z'' of the [[CIE 1931 color space]], gives the CIE chromaticity diagram.

This system implies that for any hue or non-spectral color not on the boundary of the chromaticity diagram, there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general there is no such thing as ''the'' combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the "line of purples" can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.

The CIE chromaticity diagram is horseshoe-shaped, with its curved edge corresponding to all spectral colors (the ''spectral [[locus (mathematics)|locus]]''), and the remaining straight edge corresponding to the most saturated [[purple]]s, mixtures of [[red]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]].

== Chromatic adaptation ==
{{Main|Chromatic adaptation}}

In color science, '''chromatic adaptation''' is the estimation of the representation of an object under a different light source from the one in which it was recorded. A common application is to find a ''chromatic adaptation transform'' (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral ([[color balance]]), while keeping other colors also looking realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Süsstrunk, Sabine. [http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818184220/http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between [[ICC profile]]s with different [[white point]]s. [[Adobe Photoshop]], for example, uses the Bradford CAT.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbloom, Bruce. [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223613/http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In color vision, chromatic adaptation refers to [[color constancy]]; the ability of the visual system to preserve the appearance of an object under a wide range of light sources.&lt;ref name=CAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|first=Mark D.|last=Fairchild|chapter=8.

'''''Cornflowers''''' is a painting by the Russian artist [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov]] (1915–1985), executed in 1976 and related to his most famous works in the genre of still life.

== History ==
[[Image:Osipov-Sergei-Ivanovich-9bw.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Sergei Osipov (artist)|Sergei Osipov]] &lt;br /&gt;(1915–1985)]] 

Still life ''Cornflowers'' is a laconic composition of the three items easily located on the surface of a table. This allowed the artist to effectively determine their shape, texture and color properties. In this work, Osipov certainly reaches a new quality of his painting. Polished surface of the table from which the artist took off the cloth, discovers interesting new features, giving the composition of the picture more depth. The traditional for the Osipov art theme of «spiritual sources» disclosed in painting with a special grace and taste. One of the first in the Russian Soviet Painting of 1960-1980 Sergei Osipov was able to raise a great theme in the genre of still life and make it close and understandable to every viewer. In this picture fully revealed high artistic culture that distinguishes his work, and that, in the words of Nikolai Punin can be called as the «Leningrad sensation of painting... with a kind of deeply honest, clean person deep relationship to the means of expression».

For the first time the painting was exhibited in 1980 year in Leningrad at the largest Regional Art Show in the Manezh City Exhibition Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''Regional Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1980. Exhibition catalogue''. - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1983. - P. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1983 still-life has been shown in Moscow at the Osipov one man exhibition and reproduced in the exhibition catalog.&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei Ivanovich Osipov. Painting. Drawing. Exhibition catalogue''. — Moscow: Soviet Artist, 1983. P. 25, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The article wrote the leningrad art critics Alexander Lyakhovitsky and Svetlana Makhlina. After Osipov death the painting was shown on his solo exhibition in [[1991 in Fine Arts of the Soviet Union|1991]] at the Exhibition Halls of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei Ivanovich Osipov (1915 - 1985). Painting. Drawing. Exhibition catalogue.'' — Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1990. P. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the painting was exhibited at ''Still-life painting of 1940-1990s – The Leningrad School'' art show in Saint Petersburg in the Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Still-life painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School. Exhibition catalogue.'' - Saint Petersburg: Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial museum, 1997. P. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reproduced and described in the Art Show official catalog and poster. In 2007 the «Cornflowers» was reproduced and described among 350 art works by Leningrad artists in the book «Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School»,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – P. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; published in Russian and English. In 2011 the painting «Cornflowers» was described in article devoted to the 20th Anniversary of Sergei Osipov one man exhibition of 1991, printed in St. Petersburg art history notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;''Двадцать лет спустя. Размышления о выставке Сергея Осипова.//Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Вып. 21''. СПб, 2011. С. 25-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arch of Traianus, Ancona - Tasso in Prison; - the Bridge of Sighs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|''[[Torquato Tasso#La Gerusalemme Liberata|Jerusalem Delivered]], an Heroic Poem'', translated from the Italian of [[Torquato Tasso]], by John Hoole. London 1797; with fore-edge painting: ''[[Arch of Trajan (Ancona)|Trajan's Arch]]'', ([[Ancona]]), ''Tasso in Prison'', and the ''[[Bridge of Sighs]]'']]
A '''fore-edge painting''' is a scene [[Painting|painted]] on the edges of the pages of a [[book]]. There are two basic forms, including paintings on edges that have been fanned and edges that are closed; thus with the first instance a book edge must be fanned to see the painting and in the second the painting is on the closed edge itself and thus should not be fanned. A fanned painting is one that is not visible when the book is closed.

In order to view the painting, the [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|leaves]] of the book must be fanned, exposing the edges of the pages and thereby the painting. Another basic difference is that a painting on the closed edge is painted directly on the surface of the book edge (the fore-edge being the opposite of the spine side). For the fanned painting the watercolor is applied to the top or bottom margin (recto or verso) of the page/leaf and not to the actual "fore"-edge itself.

==Variations==
A '''single fore-edge painting''' includes a painting on only one side of the book page edges. Generally, [[Gilding|gilt]] or [[Paper marbling|marbling]] is applied by the [[Bookbinding|bookbinder]] after the painting has dried, so as to make the painting completely invisible when the book is closed.

A '''double fore-edge painting''' has paintings on both sides of the page margin so that one painting is visible when the leaves are fanned one way, and the other is visible when the leaves are fanned the other way.

A '''triple fore-edge painting''' has, in addition to paintings on the edges, a third painting applied directly to the edges (in lieu of gilt or marbling). Edge paintings that are continuous scenes wrapped around more than one edge are called '''panoramic fore-edge painting'''. These are sometimes called a 'triple edge painting'.&lt;ref name=Bromer&gt;{{cite web|last=Bromer|first=Anne C.|title=Fore Edge Painting - An Introduction|url=http://foreedge.bpl.org/node/923|work=On the Edge: The Hidden Art of Fore-Edge Book Painting|publisher=Boston Public Library|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost|first=Martin|title=What Is A Fore-Edge Painting?|url=http://foreedge.bpl.org/node/2|work=On the Edge: The Hidden Art of Fore-Edge Book Painting|publisher=Boston Public Library|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''split''' '''double painting''' has two different illustrations, one on either side of the center of the book. When the book is laid open in the center, one illustration is seen on the edges of the first half of the book, and another illustration is on the edge of the second half of the book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/lovely-hidden-paintings-adorned-the-edges-of-historic-books|title=Lovely Hidden Paintings Adorned the Edges of Historic Books|date=2016-09-29|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are even examples of rare variations that require the pages of the book to be pinched or tented in a certain way to see the image.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The earliest fore-edge paintings date possibly as far back as the 10th century; these earliest paintings were symbolic designs. Early [[England|English]] fore-edge paintings, believed to date to the 14th century, presented [[Heraldry|heraldic]] designs in gold and other colors. The first known example of a ''disappearing'' fore-edge painting (where the painting is not visible when the book is closed) dates from 1649. The earliest signed and dated fore-edge painting dates to 1653: a family coat of arms painted on a 1651 [[Bible]].

There is an interesting legend of how hidden fore-edge painting on books supposedly first began: Charles II of England had a lady friend, a duchess, who often borrowed his books, sometimes forgetting to return them. As the story goes, the king commissioned the court painter, Sir [[Peter Lely]], and the court bookbinder, [[Samuel Mearne]], to devise a secret method in which his books could be identified. Between the two they worked out a unique plan. Some weeks later, when the king was visiting the duchess he spotted a familiar looking book on a shelf. Taking it down he said, “I’ll just take my book along with me.” “But sire,” the lady protested, “that book is mine.” “Oh?" The king raised his brows. Then, with a sly smile, he fanned out the book and revealed what had been painted on the inner edges--the royal coat of arms. The gilding on the outer edges had completely hidden the identification. Acknowledging that Charles had outwitted her, the duchess sank in a deep curtsy before her king.&lt;ref&gt;Dutter, Vera, E. [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/51833306/ancient-art-fore-edge-painting "The Ancient Art of Fore-Edge Painting"], ''[[American Artist]]'', January 1969. Retrieved on 3 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2018}}

Around 1750, the subject matter of fore-edge paintings changed from simply decorative or heraldic designs to [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[portraits]] and religious scenes, usually painted in full color. Modern fore-edge painted scenes have a lot more variation as they can depict numerous subjects not found on earlier specimens. These include scenes that are erotic, or they might involve scenes from novels (like Jules Verne, Sherlock Holmes or Dickens, etc.). In many cases, the chosen scene will depict a subject related to the book, but in other cases it did not. In one instance, the same [[New Brunswick]] landscape was applied to both a Bible and to a collection of poetry and plays. The choice of scenes is made by either the artist, bookseller or owner, thus the variety is wide.

The technique was popularized in the 18th century by John Brindley (1732 - 1756),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The majority of extant examples of fore-edge painting date to the late 19th and early 20th centuries on reproductions of books originally published in the early 19th century.

Artists currently expert in the fore-edge artform include UK-based artists, Martin Frost and Clare Brooksbank. The reference book of L. Jeff Weber lists many artists' and binders' names associated with this art form, including those working presently (until 2010).

'''''Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything''''' is the debut non-fiction book by [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Steven Levitt]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[Stephen J. Dubner]]. It was published on April 12, 2005, by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]]. The book has been described as melding&lt;!--sic - please do not change the spelling unless you have read the cited source and have a sufficient command of the English language--&gt; [[popular culture|pop culture]] with [[economics]].{{r|deahl}} By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.{{r|fox}}

==Overview==
The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by "traditional" economists. In ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of [[incentive]]s. The book's chapters cover:
* Chapter 1: Discovering [[cheating]] as applied to [[teacher]]s and [[sumo]] wrestlers, as well as a typical [[Washington DC]] area [[bagel]] business and its customers
* Chapter 2: Information control as applied to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[real-estate]] agents
* Chapter 3: The economics of [[drug dealing]], including the surprisingly [[minimum wage|low earnings]] and abject working conditions of [[crack cocaine]] dealers
* Chapter 4: [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime]], contrasted with the policies and downfall of [[Romania]]n dictator [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled "[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]," written with [[John J. Donohue III|John Donohue]].)
* Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good [[parenting]] on [[education]]
* Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children ([[nominative determinism]])

One example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8-6 wrestler. Statistically, the 7-7 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8-6 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7-7 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins [[collusion|collude]] with those who are 7-7 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in [[Tokyo]] was cancelled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match fixing.{{r|bbc_sumo}}

The authors attempt to demonstrate the power of [[data mining]], as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice [[high-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]]. Such cheating in the [[Chicago]] school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple choice questions. Levitt asks, "What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?", and hypothesises that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.

===Reappraisals===
In Chapter 2 of ''Freakonomics'', the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist [[Stetson Kennedy]]'s Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research ("Hoodwinked", pp.&amp;nbsp;26–28) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.

In the "Revised and Expanded Edition" this embellishment was noted and corrected: 
"Several months after ''Freakonomics'' was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated&amp;nbsp;... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record."{{r|freakonomics_xiv}}

==Criticism==
''Freakonomics'' has been criticized for being a work of [[sociology]] or [[criminology]], rather than economics. Israeli economist [[Ariel Rubinstein]] criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that "economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields", saying that the "connection to economics ... [is] none" and that the book is an example of "[[Economic imperialism (economics)|academic imperialism]]".{{r|rubinstein}} [[Arnold Kling]] has suggested the book is an example of "amateur sociology".{{r|kling}}

===The impact of legalized abortion on crime===
{{further|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s.  This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said
:"The numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing—they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4583937 |title='Freakonomics': Musings of a 'Rogue Economist' : NPR |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results ("Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp.&amp;nbsp;1 –37.). In 2004, the authors published a response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III &amp; Stephen D. Levitt |publisher=The Journal of Human Resources |year=2004 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittReply2004.pdf |title=Further Evidence that Legalized Abortion Lowered Crime: A Reply to Joyce |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to [[omitted-variable bias]].

In November 2005, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]] economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher L. Foote &amp; Christopher F. Goetz |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |date=2008-01-31 |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0515.pdf |title=The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime: Comment |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were [[middle class]] [[White Americans|whites]] rather than [[Poverty|low income]] minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle class women had the financial means for an abortion. ''[[The Economist]]'' remarked on the news of the errors that "for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=5246700 |title=Abortion, Crime, and Econometrics |date=2005-12-01 |work= |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John J. Donohue III &amp; Stephen D. Levitt |publisher= |date=January 2006 |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/ResponseToFooteGoetz2006.pdf |title=Measurement Error, Legalized Abortion, the Decline in Crime: A Response to Foote and Goetz |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.

''Freakonomics'' commented on the effects of an [[Abortion in Romania|abortion ban in Romania]] ([[Decree 770]]), stating that "Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)". John DiNardo, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], retorts that the paper cited by ''Freakonomics'' states "virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed":
{{quote|source=Freakonomics: Scholarship in the Service of Storytelling{{r|jdinardo0}}|On average, children born in 1967 just after abortions became illegal display better educational and labor market achievements than children born  prior to the change. This outcome can be explained by a change in the composition of women having children: urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, so a higher proportion of children were born into urban, educated households. (Pop-Eleches, 2002, p.34).|John DiNardo}}

Levitt responded on the ''Freakonomics'' Blog that ''Freakonomics'' and Pop-Eleches "are saying the same thing":
{{quote|Here is the abstract of the version of the Pop-Eleches paper that we cited:

{{quote|…Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. This is because urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, controlling for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults. Additionally, I provide evidence of crowding in the school system and some suggestive evidence that cohorts born after the introduction of the abortion ban had higher infant mortality and increased criminal behavior later in life.}}

The introduction of the Pop-Eleches paper says:

{{quote|This finding is consistent with the view that children who were unwanted during pregnancy had worse socio-economic outcomes once they became adults.}}}}

===Effects of extra police on crime===
''Freakonomics'' claimed that it was possible to "tease out" the effect of extra police on crime by analysing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated "While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime."{{r|jdinardo0}}

===Defamation case===
On April 10, 2006, [[John Lott]] filed suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overlawyered.com/lott_complaint.pdf/Lott%20v%20Levitt.pdf|title=PDF of Lott's complaint v. Levitt|author=|date=|website=overlawyered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[defamation]] against Steven Levitt and [[HarperCollins Publishers]] over the book and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist [[John B. McCall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parker Argues in Defamation Lawsuit - George Mason Law|url = http://www.law.gmu.edu/news/2008/parker_arguments|website = www.law.gmu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-10|first = George Mason|last = Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Freakonomics'', Levitt and coauthor [[Stephen J. Dubner]] claimed that the results of Lott's research in ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of ''[[The Journal of Law and Economics]]'' had not been peer reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Higgins |title=Best-seller leads scholar to file lawsuit; Defamation allegation targets U. of C. author |publisher=Chicago Tribune |page=3 |date=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in ''Freakonomics'' was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/judge-castillo-issues-decision-on-lott.html Judge Castillo issues decision on Lott v. Levitt]" on John Lott's website&lt;/ref&gt;

Levitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of ''The Journal of Law and Economics'', that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that "scholars with varying opinions" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenn |first=David |date=2007-08-10 |journal=Chronicle of Higher Education |title=Dueling Economists Reach Settlement in Defamation Lawsuit |volume=53|page=10| url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dueling-Economists-Reach/6720 |issue=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHD200707"/&gt; The ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' characterized Levitt's letter as offering "a [[doozy]] of a concession".&lt;ref name="CHD200707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Unusual-Agreement-Means/39297|title=Unusual Agreement Means Settlement May Be Near in 'Lott v. Levitt'|date=27 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by [[The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] on February 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=rss_sho&amp;shofile=07-3095_022.pdf 7th Circuit Affirmation of District Court Dismissal of Defamation Lawsuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216142918/http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=rss_sho&amp;shofile=07-3095_022.pdf |date=2009-02-16 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
''Freakonomics'' peaked at number two among [[nonfiction]] on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and was named the 2006 [[Book Sense]] Book of the Year in the Adult Nonfiction category. The book received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Metacritic]] reported the book had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 reviews.{{r|metacritic}}''Freakonomics'' has a social review score 69/100 on Panjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.panjury.com/trials/freakonomics|title=Freakonomics - Panjury, A Social Review Site|work=panjury.com|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Freakonomics Blog Screen Capture.jpg|thumb|right|Screen shot of Freakonomics Blog]]

The success of the book has been partly attributed to the [[blogosphere]]. In the campaign prior to the release of the book in April 2005, publisher ([[William Morrow and Company]]) chose to target bloggers in an unusually strategical way, sending galley copies to over a hundred of them, as well as contracting two specialized [[buzz marketing]] agencies.{{r|deahl}}

In 2006, the ''Revised and Expanded Edition'' of the book was published, with the most significant corrections in the second chapter.{{r|dubner}}

==Restrictions on distribution==
The book has been banned from Texas prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/02/texas-prisons-ban-books-mein-kampf-color-purple|title=Texas prisons ban The Color Purple and Monty Python – but Mein Kampf is fine|first=Edward|last=Helmore|date=2 December 2017|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freakonomics blog==
The authors started their own Freakonomics blog in 2005.

In May 2007, writer and blogger [[Melissa Lafsky]] was hired as the full-time editor of the site.{{r|blog_first_editor}} In August 2007, the blog was incorporated into ''[[The New York Times]]{{'}}'' web site – the authors had been writing joint columns for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' since 2004 – and the domain Freakonomics.com became a [[URL redirection|redirect]] there.{{r|blog_moving}} In March 2008, Annika Mengisen replaced Lafsky as the blog editor.{{r|blog_annika}}  The Freakonomics blog ended its association with the ''New York Times'' on March 1, 2011.{{r|blog_leaving}}

Among the recurrent guest bloggers on the Freakonomics blog are [[Ian Ayres]],{{r|blog_author_ayres}} [[Daniel S. Hamermesh|Daniel Hamermesh]],{{r|blog_author_hamermesh}} [[Eric A. Morris]],{{r|blog_author_morris}} [[Sudhir Venkatesh]],{{r|blog_author_venkatesh}} [[Justin Wolfers]]{{r|blog_author_wolfers}} and others.

In 2008, Stephen Dubner asked for questions from the site's readers and then featured them in an extended Q&amp;A on "Best Places to Live" with demographics expert [[Bert Sperling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubner|first=Stephen|title=Bert Sperling Answers Your "Best Places  to Live" Questions|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2008/10/14/bert-sperling-answers-your-best-places-to-live-questions/|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''SuperFreakonomics''==
{{main|SuperFreakonomics}}

{{main|Freakonomics radio}}
In September 2010, [[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace radio]] announced the creation of a Freakonomics podcast hosted by Dubner and Levitt. It is available on [[iTunes]] and is aired bi-weekly on [[NPR]].

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Freakonomics (film)}}
In 2010, [[Chad Troutwine]], Chris Romano, and Dan O'Meara produced a [[documentary film]] [[Freakonomics (film)|adaptation]] with a budget of nearly [[United States dollar|US]]$3 million in an [[Anthology|omnibus]] format by directors [[Seth Gordon]], [[Morgan Spurlock]], [[Alex Gibney]], [[Eugene Jarecki]], [[Rachel Grady]], and [[Heidi Ewing]].{{r|imdb}} It was the Closing Night Gala premiere film at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 30, 2010.{{r|kohn}} It was also the Opening Night film at the AFI/Discovery [[SilverDocs]] film festival on June 21, 2010. [[Magnolia Pictures]] acquired distribution rights for a Fall 2010 release.{{r|newsinfilm_2010}}

''Freakonomics: The Movie'' was released in major cities with a [[pay what you want]] pricing offer for selected preview showings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pay-what-you-want-to-see-freakonomics-the-movie,45265/|title=Pay what you want to see Freakonomics: The Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No report of the results has yet been published.

==Freakonomics Consulting Group==

'''Henry Barraud''' (16 May 1811 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1874) was an English portrait, [[Subject painting|subject]] and animal painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Barraud, Henry|volume=3|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/Henry_Barraud_Bio.html Biography] (Rehs Galleries inc.).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life==
Barraud was born in London, one of 17 children of William Francis Barraud (1783–1833), a clerk in the [[Custom House, London|Custom House]], and Sophia (née) Hull. His paternal grandfather was Paul Philip Barraud&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Gorman, William James. ''[https://archive.org/details/a583403600gorduoft Converts to Rome : a biographical list of the more notable converts to the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom during the last sixty years]'' (London: Sands, 1910) p33.&lt;/ref&gt; an eminent [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] maker in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]], and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Hull, a miniature painter. The family was of French [[Huguenot]] origin that had come over to England at the time of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. His elder brother [[William Barraud]] became a notable animal painter. Another brother, Edward, also had a talent for art, but did not pursue it professionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnbennettfinepaintings.co.uk/johnbennett_fine_paintings/dogs_birds_other_animals/292.asp William Barraud] (John Bennett Fine Paintings).&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his brother, Henry excelled in painting animals, but his works were chiefly portraits, with horses and dogs, and subject pictures, such as 'The Pope blessing the Animals' (painted in 1842), many of which were executed in conjunction with his brother. He exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1833 to 1859, and at the [[British Institution]] and [[Society of British Artists]] between the years 1831 and 1868. The two brothers shared a studio from 1835 until William's death in 1850, and in their joint pictures William painted the animals and Henry the figures. They also produced a book entitled "Sketches of Figures and Animals", (H. Graves and Co., c.1850).
==Works==
Barraud's most popular works were: "We praise Thee, O God"; "The London Season, a scene in Hyde Park"; "Lord's Cricket Ground"; and "The Lobby of the House of Commons" (painted in 1872), all of which were [[Engraving|engraved]] or [[autotype]]d. He was also commissioned to paint several royal portraits.
==Death==
Barraud died at his home in Gloucester Place, London on 17 June 1874, in his sixty-fourth year.
==Personal life==
His son [[Francis Barraud]] (1856–1924) was also an artist&amp;mdash;best remembered for his painting of "Nipper" the dog on the "[[His Master's Voice]]" record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |grid=10852037 |name=F J Barraud }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another son [[Herbert Rose Barraud]] (1845 &amp;ndash; c1896) was a noted portrait photographer.

'''High-level design''' (HLD) explains the architecture that would be used for developing a software product. The architecture diagram provides an overview of an entire system, identifying the main components that would be developed for the product and their interfaces.
The HLD uses possibly nontechnical to mildly technical terms that should be understandable to the administrators of the system. In contrast, [[low-level design]] further exposes the logical detailed design of each of these elements for programmers.

== Purpose ==
* Preliminary design—In the preliminary stages of a software development, the need is to size the project and to identify those parts of the project that might be risky or time consuming.
* Design overview—As the project proceeds, the need is to provide an overview of how the various sub-systems and components of the system fit together.

In both cases the high-level design should be a complete view of the entire system, breaking it down into smaller parts that are more easily understood. To minimize the maintenance overhead as construction proceeds and the lower-level design is done, it is best that the high-level design is elaborated only to the degree needed to satisfy these needs.

== High-level design document ==
A high-level design document or HLDD adds the necessary details to the current project description to represent a suitable model for coding. This document includes a high-level architecture diagram depicting the structure of the system, such as the database
architecture, application architecture (layers), application flow (navigation), security architecture and technology architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/research/Students/CJ_05_Design.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design overview ==
A high-level design provides an overview of a system, product, service or process.

Such an overview helps supporting components be compatible to others.

The highest-level design should briefly describe all platforms, systems, products, services and processes that it depends on and include any important changes that need to be made to them.

In addition, there should be brief consideration of all significant commercial, legal, environmental, security, safety and technical risks, issues and assumptions.

The idea is to mention every work area briefly, clearly delegating the ownership of more detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration between the various project teams.

Today, most high-level designs require contributions from a number of experts, representing many distinct professional disciplines.

Finally, every type of end-user should be identified in the high-level design and each contributing design should give due consideration to customer experience.

The '''Afghanistan Compact''' was the outcome of the London Conference on Afghanistan in 2006. It was the result of consultations of the government of [[Afghanistan]] with the [[United Nations]] and the [[international community]] and established the framework for international cooperation with Afghanistan for the following five years.  The Afghanistan Compact is a political commitment of the participants and not an actionable treaty.

== Introduction ==
On January 31 and February 1, 2006, 66 states and 15 international organizations participated in the London Conference on Afghanistan, which was chaired by British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Afghanistan's President [[Hamid Karzai]] and UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]. The government of Afghanistan provided an overview of developments in the country and of its strategies, priorities and plans for economic and political development in the following five years. At the end of the conference, the delegates adopted the Afghanistan Compact, a political agreement between the international community and the government of Afghanistan. 

The agreement confirms the commitment of both the government of Afghanistan and the international community to cooperate in creating conditions allowing the people of Afghanistan to live in peace and security under the rule of law, with a strong government which protects human rights and supports economic and social development in the country.

The compact followed the formal conclusion of the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn process]], which had launched the reconstruction process in 2001 and reached its goal in the parliamentary and provincial elections in 2005. It serves as a basis for the next stage of reconstruction, which is to rely more strongly on the country's own institutions. The donor countries and institutions promised to support this process with a total of 10.5 billion [[US dollar]]s.

== Individual measures (selection) ==
=== Goal: Increased security ===
*A professional and ethnically balanced [[Afghan National Army]] with up to 70.000 soldiers is to be established and fully functional by 2010.
*The police being formed is to provide reliable security in the country and at the borders.
*Reduction of existing [[mine field]]s by 70%.
*Disarmament of all illegal [[militia]]s by 2007 at the latest.

=== Goal: Drug reduction ===
The government of Afghanistan increases its measures to curb drugs, with the goal of completely ending the cultivation of [[opium poppy]] in Afghanistan and cutting off the supply of raw opium from Afghanistan to hinder the production of and trade in [[heroin]]. 

=== Goal: Efficient executive ===
*Government personnel is to be reduced to provide an efficient public administration. 
*The National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan is to increase women's chances of working in government and public service.

=== Goal: Economic and social development ===
*The government's revenues are to be nearly doubled to approximately 8% of the [[gross domestic product]] by 2010. 
*66% of households in major urban areas and 25% in rural areas are to be provided with [[electricity]].
*50% of households in the capital [[Kabul]] and 30% of households in other major urban areas are to have access to piped water.
*At least 60% of girls and at least 75% of boys are to be enrolled in primary schools.
*At least 90% of the population are to have access to basic health services.
*The proportion of people living on less than 1 US dollar a day is to decrease by 3% each year. 
*The proportion of people who suffer from [[hunger]] is to be reduced by 5% each year.

=== Monitoring ===
A Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, co-chaired by a senior Afghan official and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan, ensures implementation and monitoring of the steps of this five-year plan.

'''Jacques Rancière''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɑ̃sjɛʁ|lang}}; born 1940) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], Professor of Philosophy at [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]]  and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis]] who came to prominence when he co-authored ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1968), with the [[Structural Marxism|structuralist Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ Jacques Rancière Faculty Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417061517/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ |date=2010-04-17 }} at [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Rancière contributed to the influential volume ''[[Reading Capital]]'' before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 [[French May|student uprising in Paris]]; Rancière felt Althusser's theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"&gt;Ben Davis. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/books/davis/davis8-17-06.asp Rancière, For Dummies.] The Politics of Aesthetics. Book Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up our understanding of political discourse, such as [[ideology]] and [[proletariat]]. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with [[knowledge]], particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled ''Le philosophe et ses pauvres'' (''The Philosopher and His Poor'', 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify [[human rights]] interventions and even war.

Rancière's book, ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]'' (original title ''Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle'', published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be.  Through the story of [[Joseph Jacotot]], Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination.  In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach ''themselves'' whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in ''The Ignorant Schoolmaster'', saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]|author=Jacques Ranciere |pages=13, 18|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epistemologies of Ignorance in Education |author=Molly Quinn |chapter=Committing (to) Ignorance |pages=31–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In 2006, it was reported that Rancière's [[aesthetic]] theory had become a point of reference in the [[visual arts]], and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"/&gt; Former French presidential candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] described Rancière as her favourite philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation: Jacques Rancière, the philosopher who inspires Ségolène Royal|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/5508-translation-sl-royals-favorite-philosopher.html|work=United for Peace of Pierce County, WA|publisher=[[Paris Match]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|author=Patrice Bollon|author2=Mark K. Jensen|page=34|date=December 2006|quote=Scoop: we've found out where the Socialist candidate got her ideas! From this intellectual sensitive to political alienation. Jacques Rancière.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, [[Gabriel Rockhill]] has developed a new paradigm for thinking the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière's writings.

'''''Just Seen It'''''  was a [[film]] and [[television]] review show created by David Freedman in 2010. It started on [[YouTube]] as a tribute to [[Siskel and Ebert]]'s ''[[At the Movies (1982–1990 TV series)|At the Movies]]''. The first episode appeared on the web in January 2010, and the last episode in January 2015. More than {{formatnum:1000}} reviews were produced, covering newly released features, network and cable television shows, new releases on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]], and interviews with industry leaders such as director [[Michael Apted]] and actor [[Richard Portnow]].

''Just Seen It'' aired on PBS SOCAL/PBS OC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.pbssocal.org/program/just-seen-it/ PBS Socal website]&lt;/ref&gt; from September 2012 to January 2013, with 20 episodes, and was offered through NETA (National Educational Telecommunications Association) to 370 PBS stations nationwide starting January 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zorianna-kit/pbs-gets-back-in-the-movi_b_3371828.html |title=PBS back in the movie review business with "Just Seen It" |author=Zorianna Kit |date=June 1, 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2014-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
[[libertarianism|Libertarians]] have differing opinions on the validity of [[intellectual property]].

==Political parties==
The [[Libertarian Party of Canada]] takes "a moderate approach to patents and copyrights", calling for "a careful review of existing and proposed legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131447/https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anarcho-capitalist views ==

Since [[anarcho-capitalist]]s oppose the existence of even a minimal state, this ideological framework requires that any functions served by intellectual property law promulgation and enforcement be provided through private sector institutions.

[[Murray Rothbard]] argues for allowing contractually arising infinite copyright terms and against the need for any government role in protecting intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp |title=Chapter 3 – Triangular Intervention |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that government's involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration, scope, etc. of intellectual property in order to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" is inherently problematic, since "By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are 'too much,' 'too little,' or just about enough?" He argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10e.asp#7._Patents_Copyrights |title=Chapter 10 – Monopoly and Competition (continued) |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris and Linda Tannehill]] propose that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned "data bank"; the inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention, and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=58–59|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|chapter=Property – The Great Problem Solver|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to intellectual property rights include [[Wendy McElroy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |year=2011 |title=Contra Copyright, Again |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2011/lp-3-12.pdf |journal=Libertarian Papers |volume=3 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom G. Palmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Tom G. |year=1990 |title=Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified? The Philosophy of Property Rights and Ideal Objects |url=http://tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/palmer-morallyjustified-harvard-v13n3.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy |volume=13 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Lepage (economist)|Henri Lepage]], [[Boudewijn Bouckaert]], [[Jeffrey Tucker]], and [[N. Stephan Kinsella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bouillon |first=Hardy|editor-link1=Jörg Guido Hülsmann |editor1-first=Jörg Guido |editor1-last=Hülsmann |editor2-first=Stephan |editor2-last=Kinsella |title=Property, Freedom, and Society: Essays in Honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |year=2009 |page=157 |chapter=A Note on Intellectual Property and Externalities |isbn=978-1-933550-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella points out in ''Against Intellectual Property'' that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He notices that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kinsella |first=N. Stephan |year=2008 |title=Against Intellectual Property |url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Stephan%20Kinsella/Against%20Intellectual%20Property.pdf |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-1-933550-32-9 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David D. Friedman]] takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, claiming "there are good arguments on both sides of that question".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/3771/Anthony-Wile-David-D-Friedman-on/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left-libertarian views ==

[[Roderick T. Long]] argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and that since information exists in people's minds and other people's property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Claiming that authors and publishers will continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |title=The Libertarian Case Against Intellectual Property Rights |publisher=Libertariannation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233356/http%3A//libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |archivedate=2002-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Tucker]], opposing intellectual property, writes, "...the patent monopoly...consists in protecting inventors...against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,{{spaced ndash}}in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, ''Instead of a Book, By a Man Too Busy to Write One: A Fragmentary Exposition of Philosophical Anarchism'' (New York: Tucker, 1893), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand's views ==

[[Ayn Rand]], founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], supported copyrights and patents, noting in ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |year=1966 |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights: a man's right to the product of his mind. Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form the origination of an ''idea''. The subject of patents and copyrights is ''intellectual'' property. ... Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence.}}
She held that patent should be granted for limited terms only: 
{{cquote|If it were held in perpetuity, it would lead to the opposite of the very principle on which it is based: it would lead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned support of parasitism.  It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborn generations, which would ultimately paralyze them. Consider what would happen if, in producing an automobile, we had to pay royalties to the descendants of all the inventors involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up.  Apart from the impossibility of keeping such records, consider the accidental status of such descendants and the unreality of their unearned claims.}}

== Other libertarian and anarcho-libertarian views ==

Anarchists such as [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[J. Neil Schulman]] have also argued for forms of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;See: Kinsella, [http://c4sif.org/2015/10/classical-liberals-and-anarchists-on-intellectual-property/ Classical Liberals and Anarchists on Intellectual Property], which also lists other classical liberals and anarchists and their positions on intellectual property. Kinsella's post [http://c4sif.org/2015/04/pro-ip-anarchists-and-anti-ip-patent-attorneys/ Pro-IP “Anarchists” and anti-IP Patent Attorneys] lists some more recent anarchist libertarians in favor of intellectual property. For further discussion of the views of various libertarians on this matter, see his [http://c4sif.org/resources/ Anti-IP Resources], [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-four-historical-phases-of-ip-abolitionism/ The Four Historical Phases of IP Abolitionism], and [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-origins-of-libertarian-ip-abolitionism/ The Origins of Libertarian IP Abolitionism].&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a descriptive '''list of art from the [[Stone Age]]''', the period of [[prehistory]] characterised by the widespread use of [[stone tool]]s. This page contains, by sheer volume of the artwork discovered, a very incomplete list of the works of the painters, sculptors, and other artists who created what we now call prehistoric art. For fuller lists see [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], [[Art of the Middle Paleolithic]], and [[:Category:Prehistoric art]] and its many sub-categories.

The '''Los Angeles Women's Music Festival''' was a 2007 [[Los Angeles]] based summer [[music festival]] that featured exclusively female solo artists and female-led bands.

==Overview==
In 2007, Los Angeles based female musicians [[Gayle Day]], [[Miria (singer)]], [[Gilli Moon]] and Toni Koch, in partnership with [[Warrior Girl Music]], [[SheJay]], and [[Adventure Art Entertainment]], produced the first women's music festival in Los Angeles. Inspired by [[Lilith Fair]] and held at Woodley Park (CA), home of WorldFest (LA), Los Angeles' largest Earth Day festival, the Los Angeles Women's Music Festival was an eco-music-fest featuring over 65 bands on 5 solar-powered stages, offering vegan, vegetarian and organic refreshments, and featuring pet adoptions, and was attended by over 2500 people. The Los Angeles Women's Music Festival also donated a percentage of proceeds to Los Angeles animal rescue groups. The festival was started in 2007 as an annual festival but was on hiatus during 2008 and was scheduled to return in 2009, although the latter event never materialized. As of 2015, it is on indefinite hiatus due to financial challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawmf.com/about.html Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival official website: About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517125648/http://www.lawmf.com/about.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/lawmf07 MySpace: Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival Newsletter - Vol. 1 Issue 1 - March 8, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/218388/ Yahoo!

==Education==

Pakenham-Walsh trained as an artist at [[Lancaster and Morecambe College|Lancaster and Morecambe College of Arts and Crafts]] (1954–58) and [[Wimbledon College of Art]] (1958-59).&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary" /&gt; The writer and artist [[Mervyn Peake]] was an early mentor.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;

==Career==

From the beginning of her career, Pakenham-Walsh created drawings, paintings, and sculptures made almost exclusively from mundane and salvaged materials;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary"/&gt; this unique strategy was borne of necessity as Pakenham-Walsh encountered "social barriers associated with being a female artist in the mid twentieth century, which made it difficult for her [...] to acquire raw materials for her art."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh's first published artwork was in the early 1960s when her [[Ballpoint pen|biro]] drawings appeared in the literary journal ''[[Transatlantic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 41512113| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 11, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41514022| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 12, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, she was employed as a designer at [[Pinewood Studios]], where she created set-pieces for major motion-pictures, including [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|''Cleopatra'']]; she also worked as a sculptor at [[Shepperton Studios]].&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News Biographical article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?coll_id=848&amp;inst_id=1&amp;term=Artists%20%7C%20Wales%20%7C%20Archives |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh Papers |publisher=The National Library of Wales |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Clive |title=Woodcarving in Coalshed Brings Fame |date=1 January 1982 |access-date=13 August 2016 |url=https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/utilities/action/act_download.cfm?mediaid=28070&amp;langtoken=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1982, she exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition|Summer Exhibitions]] of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1905—1970 Vol. 5 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=EP Publishing Limited |year=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1971—1989 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=Hilmarton Manor Press |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, select London artists rejected abstraction and conceptualism to pursue "the depiction of the human figure and everyday landscape";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/london/inner.html |title=London Calling |last1=Brooks |first1=Julian |last2=Potts |first2=Timothy |website=getty.edu |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2016 |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakenham-Walsh also sought to depict ordinary daily life, creating art that was both "playful and profound [to] invoke the [[Flow (psychology)|deep time]] of human nature."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh "exhibited widely in her lifetime in many art galleries and museums" worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt; Her work has been shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and is held in numerous public and private collections, including: the [[National Library of Wales]], the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Aberystwyth University]], and the [[UK Craft Council]]; the actor and art historian [[Vincent Price]] and the photographer [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]] also admired and collected her work.&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good Reads article"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/5690320-ten-to-one-author-interview---yasmin-ali |title=Ten To One author interview - Yasmin Ali |publisher=Good Reads |access-date= 11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.aber.ac.uk/person/782 |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh |publisher=Aberystwyth University |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.craftscouncil.org.uk/results?mi_search_type=adv&amp;mi_adv_search=yes&amp;sort=1&amp;maker_id=AUTH982 |title=Crafts Council Collections |publisher=Crafts Council |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">The '''Michle Madonna''' is the work of an unknown sculptor called the "Master of the Michle Madonna" who probably worked in [[Brno]] or [[Prague]] during the second third of the 14th century. The name of the sculpture, brought from Brno in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Hrabovská, 2008, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; relates to its non-original location in the parish church in Michle from where it was purchased by the [[National Gallery in Prague]].
[[File:Michelská madona, Národní galerie v Praze.jpg|thumb|''Michle Madonna'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]

== Description and context == 
The sculpture of the Michle Madonna is 120&amp;nbsp;cm tall and is carved from pear wood. It bears traces of polychromy. It is the most important example of the linear-rhythmic style of carving, dating from the second quarter of the 14th century in the Czech lands. This style is characterised by drapery that clings to a cylindrical torso in low, sagging pleats that have a decorative and finely drawn character, as does the linen cloth and locks of hair. The legs of the figure of the Madonna in [[contrapposto|contrapose]] are clearly distinguished between the standing and loose one. The child is resting on the Madonna’s jutting right side, towards which both the vertical and horizontal folds of the clothes converge, thus emphasising the bond between the mother and child. The lower position of the child enables the mother’s head to bow more, thereby making the sculptural composition more enclosed. The [[Christ Child|Infant Jesus]]’s hands have not survived but it is clear that he is making a [[blessing]], and is thus not turned towards his mother but towards the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;Hrabovská, 2008, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Michle Madonna’s formal conception has much in common with the linear style of [[Gothic art#Sculpture|French stone sculpture]] of the first third of the 14th century (such as the sculpture of five apostles from the Church of St Jacques-aux-Pèlerins and the tomb sculptures of French kings at [[Basilica of St Denis|St Denis]])&lt;ref&gt;Homolka, 2005, pp. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt; that could have been mediated to the Czech context through the [[Rhineland]]. Sculptures of this style are typified by stylisation of shapes and a dense schematic linear pleating of the drapery in both standing and reclining figures. The objective details and wealth of decoration, precisely observed and reproduced, are striking. The group of wooden sculptures related to the Michle Madonna were also originally covered with polychromy, gilding and embossing.

The distinct abstracting style of the workshop of the "Master of the Michle Madonna" gradually absorbed the impulses of contemporary panel painting that was oriented more towards Italian models – the head of the Michle Madonna bears a striking resemblance to the "Madonna of Veveří". It was characterised by a greater emphasis on the physical volume of the figures and the realistic depiction of details. The workshop also produced other Moravian Madonnas (such as the "Madonna of Velké Meziříčí", the small "Apostle of Veverská Bitýška", the "Znojmo Madonna" and the "Prostějov Madonna"). Late works ascribed to the workshop of the "Master of the Michle Madonna" prefigured the abandoning of linear formalism that was accompanied by the effort to achieve specific form and greater naturalism.

'''''Magnolia''''' is a 1999 American epic [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, co-produced and directed by [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]. The film stars [[Jeremy Blackman]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Philip Baker Hall]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Ricky Jay]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jason Robards]] and [[Melora Walters]], and is a mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the [[San Fernando Valley]].

''Magnolia'' received positive reviews, with critics praising its acting, direction, storytelling, ambition, and [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], largely consisting of [[Aimee Mann]] songs; however, some deemed it overlong and melodramatic. Of the [[ensemble cast]], Tom Cruise was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]], and won the award in that category at the [[Golden Globes]] of 2000. The film also won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It was Robards' final feature film.

==Plot==
The narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than chance play important roles in life.

Police officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman's apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder but Jim is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia's neighbors called the police after she had an argument with her estranged father, children's game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting [[cocaine]]. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night; she says yes.

Jimmy hosts a long-running quiz show called ''What Do Kids Know?'' and is dying of cancer; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on air, Stanley refuses to return for the final round.

Donnie Smith, a former ''What Do Kids Know?'' champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent the money he won as a child, a lightning strike has damaged his mental capacity, and he has just been fired from his job at Solomon &amp; Solomon, an electronics store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting oral surgery, thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.

The show's former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of [[cancer]]. Earl's trophy wife, Linda, collects his prescriptions for [[morphine]] while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a [[motivational speaker]] peddling a [[pickup artist]] course to men. Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family. An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him.

Linda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him to change Earl's will. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.

Before his date with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.

Jimmy Gator goes home to his wife Rose and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember whether he abused Claudia. Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone, and she walks out on him. Jimmy decides to kill himself.

Donnie takes money from the Solomon &amp; Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money, but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, [[Raining animals|frogs begin falling from the sky]], with multiple consequences: as Jimmy is about to kill himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the TV which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl dies as Frank watches the frogs; Linda's ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole and smashes his teeth, then is dragged to safety by Jim.

Jim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money; his gun falls from the sky. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover from her attempted suicide. Stanley, on his way to bed, tells his father that he needs to be nicer to him, but his father ignores him and tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them; she smiles in reply.

==Production==
===Development===
Anderson started to get ideas for ''Magnolia'' during the long editing period of ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  As he got closer to finishing the film, he started writing down material for his new project.&lt;ref name="konow"&gt;{{cite news | last = Konow | first = David | title = PTA Meeting: An Interview with Paul Thomas Anderson | publisher = Creative Screenwriting | date = January–February 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the critical and financial success of ''Boogie Nights'', [[New Line Cinema]], who backed that film, told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, "I was in a position I will never ever be in again".&lt;ref name="hirschberg"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hirschberg | first = Lynn | title = His Way | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = December 19, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael De Luca]], then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for ''Magnolia'', granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldstein"&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldstein | first = Patrick | title = Heading in a New Direction | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = December 24, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was "intimate and small-scale",&lt;ref name="patterson"&gt;{{cite news| last = Patterson | first = John | title = ''Magnolia'' Maniac | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = March 10, 2000 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features| accessdate = April 12, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that he could shoot in 30 days.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = ''Magnolia'' Production Notes | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | year = 1999 | url = http://www.cigarettesandredvines.com/film.php?id=MMB | accessdate = February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the title of "Magnolia" in his head before he wrote the script.&lt;ref name="strauss2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = ''Magnolia'' Springs from Valley Roots | publisher = ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'' | date = December 19, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he started writing, the script "kept blossoming" and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; He wanted to "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt; Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue",&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress [[Melora Walters]].&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; The next image that came to him was of [[Philip Baker Hall]] as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her.&lt;ref name="portman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = How ''Magnolia'' Grew and Grew | publisher = ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' | date = December 30, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt;

Before Anderson became a filmmaker, one of the jobs he had was as an assistant for a television game show, ''Quiz Kid Challenge'', an experience he incorporated into the script for ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="goldstein"/&gt; He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like "[[A Day in the Life]]" by [[The Beatles]], and "it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt; The production designers looked at films with close, tight color palettes, films that were warm and analyzed why they did that and then applied it to ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; They also wanted to evoke the colors of the magnolia flower: greens, browns and off-whites. For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked [[Pathé]] camera that would have been used at the time.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; Some of the actors were nervous about singing the lyrics to Mann's "Wise Up" in the film's climactic scene and so Anderson had Moore do it first and she set the pace and everyone else followed.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

Anderson and New Line reportedly had intense arguments about how to market ''Magnolia''.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on ''Boogie Nights'' and did not like the studio's poster or trailer for ''Magnolia''. Anderson ended up designing his own poster, cut together a trailer himself,&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; wrote the liner notes for the soundtrack album, and pushed to avoid hyping Cruise's presence in the film in favor of the ensemble cast.&lt;ref name="puig"/&gt; Even though Anderson ultimately got his way, he realized that he had to "learn to fight without being a jerk. I was a bit of a baby. At the first moment of conflict, I behaved in a slightly adolescent knee-jerk way. I just screamed."&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article, published around the time of ''Magnolia'''s release, Anderson said that he walked out of ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'' after the first half hour and criticized its director, [[David Fincher]], for making jokes about cancer, saying that he should get it as punishment. Afterwards, Anderson wrote Fincher a note apologizing and explained that he had lost his sense of humor about cancer.&lt;ref name="lacey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lacey | first = Liam | title = The Lion and the Young Cub | publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | date = January 22, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is known for his use of [[long take]]s in his films, moving along considerable distances with complex pivoting movements and transitions in actors and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/video-steadicam-progress-career-paul-thomas-anderson-five |title=Video: Steadicam progress – the career of Paul Thomas Anderson in five shots |author=Kevin B. Lee |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the long takes in ''Magnolia'', the most notable may be the 2 minutes 15 seconds where character Stanley Spector arrives at the studio for a taping of ''What Do Kids Know?'', the camera seamlessly moving through multiple rooms and hallways, transitioning to follow different characters throughout the take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/05/25-the-place-beyond-the.html |title=25 Great Extended Shots in Film History |author= Mark Rozeman |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay===
By the time he started writing the script, Anderson was listening to [[Aimee Mann]]'s music.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; Anderson used her two solo albums and some demo tracks from a new album that Mann was working on as a basis and inspiration for the film.&lt;ref name="bessman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bessman | first = Jim | title = Music Blossomed into Film | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = December 16, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Mann's song "Deathly", on her album ''[[Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo]]'', inspired the character of Claudia.&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; At one point in the movie, Claudia uses part of the lyric as dialogue in the film ("Now that I've met you/Would you object to/Never seeing each other again").&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

The character of Jim Kurring originated in the summer of 1998 when actor [[John C. Reilly]] grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of [[Cops (TV series)|''COPS'']] with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was "always cast as these heavies or these semi-[[mental retardation|retarded]] child men. Can't you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?"&lt;ref name="braun"&gt;{{cite news | last = Braun | first = Liz | title = He Finally Gets the Girl| publisher = ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' | date = January 11, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

For [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], Anderson wanted him to play a "really simple, uncomplicated, caring character".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; The actor described his character as someone who "really takes pride in the fact that every day he's dealing with life and death circumstances".&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; With [[Julianne Moore]] in mind, the director wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to the actress, "Linda doesn't know who she is or what she's feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible".&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = Everything's Coming Up ''Magnolia''s for Actress | publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | date = December 23, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For William H. Macy, Anderson felt that the actor was scared of big, emotional parts and wrote for him, "a big tearful, emotional part".&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt;

While convincing [[Philip Baker Hall]] to do the film by explaining the significance of the rain of frogs, the actor told him a story about when he was in the mountains of [[Italy]] and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed.&lt;ref name="pevere"&gt;{{cite news | last = Pevere | first = Geoff | title = Director Can Do Both Riveting and Ribbiting | publisher = ''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date = January 23, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as [[Bob Barker]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]].&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Dawson | first = Tom | title = I Went from Being Anonymous to: 'Who Is This Guy We've Got To Have Him' | publisher = ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' | date = March 5, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of [[Charles Fort]] and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in [[The Bible]] when he first wrote the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Reinhartz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lu-hXPqGJsMC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=paul+thomas+anderson+unaware+of+bible+reference+magnolia#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20thomas%20anderson%20unaware%20of%20bible%20reference%20magnolia ''Scripture on the Silver Screen''], Westminster John Knox Press, 2003 p25-26&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was "going through a weird, personal time", and he started to understand "why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes sense to me somehow".&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt;

===Casting===
[[Tom Cruise]] was a fan of Anderson's previous film, ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', and contacted the filmmaker while he was working on [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="weinraub"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | title = ''Boogie'' Writer Back in the Valley | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = October 8, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson met with Cruise on the set of Kubrick's film and the actor told him to keep him in mind for his next film. After Anderson finished the script, he sent Cruise a copy and the next day, the actor called him. Cruise was interested but nervous about the role. They met with Cruise along with De Luca who helped convince the actor to do the film.&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; Frank T.J. Mackey, the character that Cruise would play in the film, was based in part on an audio-recording done in an engineering class taught by a friend that was given to Anderson.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; It consisted of two men, "talking all this trash" about women and quoting a man named [[Ross Jeffries]], who was teaching a new version of the [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]] course, "How to Pick Up Women," but utilizing [[hypnotism]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] language techniques.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; Anderson transcribed the tape and did a reading with Reilly and [[Chris Penn]].&lt;ref name="hirschberg"/&gt; The director then incorporated this dialogue and his research on Jeffries and other self-help gurus into Mackey and his sex seminar.&lt;ref name="konow"/&gt; Anderson felt that Cruise was drawn to the role because he had just finished making ''Eyes Wide Shut'', playing a repressed character, and was able to then play a character that was "outlandish and bigger-than-life".&lt;ref name="strauss2"/&gt;

Anderson wrote the role of Earl Partridge for [[Jason Robards]], but Robards was initially unable to do it because of a serious [[staph infection]]. Anderson approached [[George C. Scott]], who turned him down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title=Interview: USA Today|date=7 January 2000|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|url=http://cigsandredvines.blogspot.com/2000/01/interview-usa-today.html|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Robards was able to do the film.&lt;ref name="puig"&gt;{{cite news | last = Puig | first = Claudia | title = Dangerous Ground Is Paul Thomas Anderson's Turf | publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' | date = January 7, 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robards said of his character, "It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for me to do this and bring what I know to it".&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt; According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.&lt;ref name="dawson"/&gt;

Anderson wanted [[Burt Reynolds]] to star in the film, but Reynolds declined it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|title=Burt Reynolds: 'I regret turning down Greta Garbo'|date=3 December 2015|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/burt-reynolds-guardian-live-interview-hate-paul-thomas-anderson|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and soundtracks==
{{Main|Magnolia (soundtrack)|Magnolia (score)}}
Anderson met [[Aimee Mann]] in 1996 when he asked her husband, [[Michael Penn]], to write the score and songs for his film, ''[[Hard Eight (film)|Hard Eight]]''. Mann had songs on soundtracks before but never "utilized in such an integral way" she said in an interview.&lt;ref name="weinraub"/&gt; She gave Anderson rough mixes of songs and found that they both wrote about the same kinds of characters.&lt;ref name="weinraub"/&gt; He encouraged her to write songs for the film by sending her a copy of the script.&lt;ref name="prodnotes"/&gt;

Two songs were written expressly for the film: "You Do", which was based on a character later cut from the film, and "Save Me", which closes the film;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; the latter was nominated in the 2000 [[Academy Award]]s and [[Golden Globes]] and in the 2001 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]. Most of the remaining seven Mann songs were demos and works in progress; "Wise Up", which is at the center of a sequence in which all of the characters sing the song,&lt;ref name="patterson"/&gt; was originally written for the 1996 film ''[[Jerry Maguire]]''. At the time Mann's record label had refused to release her songs on an album.&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; The song that plays at the opening of the film is Mann's cover of [[One (Harry Nilsson song)|"One"]] by [[Harry Nilsson]]. Mann's track "Momentum" is used as the loud playing music in Claudia's apartment scene when Officer Jim arrives and was also featured in the trailer for the film.

The [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], released in December 1999 on [[Reprise Records]], features the Mann songs, as well as a section of [[Jon Brion]]'s score and tracks by [[Supertramp]] and [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] that were used in the film. Reprise released a [[Magnolia (score)|full score album]] in March 2000.

''Magnolia'' initially opened in a [[limited release]] on December 17, 1999, in seven theaters grossing [[United States dollar|USD$]]193,604. The film was given a [[wide release]] on January 7, 2000, in 1,034 theaters grossing $5.7 million on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $22,455,976 in North America and $25,995,827 in the rest of the world with a worldwide tally of $48,451,803, above its budget of $37 million.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news| title = ''Magnolia'' | publisher = ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' | date = | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=magnolia.htm | accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Magnolia'' struggled at the box office, it was well-received critically. {{As of|2018}} it has an 83% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 119 "fresh" reviews out of 144.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes| id=magnolia| title=Magnolia}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "the most imperfect of the year's best movies".&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | title = ''Magnolia'' Unfolds with Epic Boldness | work = [[USA Today]] | date = December 17, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film, saying: "''Magnolia'' is the kind of film I instinctively respond to.

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "But when that group sing-along arrives, ''Magnolia'' begins to self-destruct spectacularly. It's astonishing to see a film begin this brilliantly only to torpedo itself in its final hour," but went on to say that the film "was saved from its worst, most reductive ideas by the intimacy of the performances and the deeply felt distress signals given off by the cast".&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{cite news | last = [[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]| title = Entangled Lives on the Cusp of the Millennium | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 17, 1999 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940CE3DD1430F934A25751C1A96F958260 | accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip French, in his review for ''[[The Observer]]'', wrote, "But is the joyless universe he (Anderson) presents any more convincing than the Pollyanna optimism of traditional [[sitcom]]s?

===Raining frogs and Exodus (Bible) references===
{{further|Raining animals}}
At the end of the film, [[frog]]s rain from the sky. Throughout the film, there are references to the [[Book of Exodus]] 8:2 "And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will [[Plagues of Egypt#Frogs2ndPlague|smite all thy borders with frogs]]."

The film has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and 1930s works of [[Charles Fort]]. Fortean author [[Loren Coleman]]'s 2001 book "Mysterious America: The Revised Edition" includes a chapter entitled "The Teleporting Animals and ''Magnolia''", addressing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lorencoleman.com/books-by-loren-coleman/ |title=Books by Loren Coleman |publisher=The Cryptozoologist : Loren Coleman   |date=2012 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter discusses how one of Fort's books is visible on the table in the library and the film's end credit thanking Charles Fort.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Loren | title=Mysterious America: The Ultimate Guide to the Nation's Weirdest Wonders, Strangest Spots, and Creepiest Creatures | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only character who seems to be unsurprised by the falling frogs is Stanley. He calmly observes the event, saying, "This happens. This is something that happens." This has led to the speculation that Stanley is a [[prophet]], [[Allegory|allegorically]] akin to [[Moses]], and that the "[[slavery]]" the film alludes to is the exploitation of children by adults.&lt;ref name="hipps"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hipps | first=Shane | title=''Magnolia'': The Exodus for Kids | publisher=Metaphilm | date=May 9, 2003 | url=http://metaphilm.com/philm.php?id=96_0_2_0 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "father issues" persist throughout the film, as seen in the abuse and neglect of Claudia, Frank, Donnie, Stanley, and Dixon.&lt;ref name="pta"&gt;{{cite book | last=Anderson | first=Paul Thomas | title=The Paul Thomas Anderson Shooting Script Set: ''Magnolia'' and ''Punch-Drunk Love'' | publisher=[[Newmarket Press]] | date=January 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The [[DVD]] release includes a lengthy behind-the-scenes [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''That Moment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Germain|title=Watch: 'That Moment,' A 72 Minute Documentary on P.T.

The behind-the-scenes documentary is an in-depth look into Anderson's motivation and directing style. Pre-production included a screening of the film ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' (1976), as well as ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (1980). Several scenes showed Anderson at odds with the child actors and [[Child labour|labor laws]] that restrict their work time. The character of Dixon has further scenes filmed but, from Anderson's reactions, appear not to be working. These scenes were cut completely and have never been shown on DVD.

'''''Maurin Quina''''' is a [[France|French]] [[apéritif]] advertisement painted by [[Leonetto Cappiello]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  It is perhaps Cappiello's most famous poster.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;National Gallery of Australia. [http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=144322 "Maurin Quina."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The image features a devilish figure sneakily de-corking the bottle; Cappiello used "infernal imagery" in several of his posters for alcohol.&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  The green devil in particular evokes ''la fée verte'' (the green fairy), the nickname for [[absinthe]], a drink popular during the [[Belle Époque]].&lt;ref name="au"/&gt;  The product was banned by the French government shortly after it was released. This poster, however, is an advertisement for an alcoholic beverage that went out of production in 1906. Maurin is the brand name and Quina is the type of alcohol. The product has since been reintroduced to both the French and American marketplace, featuring Cappiello's poster as the label. It is cherry in flavor with a background of quinine. It is similar to a liqueur, but does not contain enough sugar content to legally be classified as one.

[[Image:Udstillingen 1888 by Vilhelm Tillge.jpg|thumb|250px|The great hall of the Nordic Exhibition of 1888, photographed by [[Vilhelm Tillge]] ]]

The '''Nordic exhibition of Industry, Agriculture, and Art of 1888''' was an [[World's fair|exhibition]] that aimed to feature the best of art, industry, and agriculture from the five [[Nordic countries]]. It was a joint-venture between 29 organisations and institutions, with the weight on the private side, represented foremost by the Association of Copenhagen Industrialists. The exhibition was located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and was visited by 1.3 million people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Influence of national responsibility ==

Organizers contributed with his or her picture of "what the fuss was all about." Pictures which were added to the event as a whole. In the spring of 1883, however, all these views on the exhibition were part of the future. At that point the completeness of the exhibition was narrowed down to be an idea fostered by Mr. [[Philip Schou]]. The latter was a successful [[shareholder]] and daily manager of the [[ceramic]] factory [[Royal Copenhagen]].

Like the foregoing generations of influential men - say, in the years from democracy was being introduced to the state of Denmark - Philip Schou took a great length of time to involve himself in national issues. In short, the idea to the exhibition was fostered in a period when the nation was being built. Built by men who recognized they were in that process, even though they surely could only guess on the collective outcome of their actions.

The emphasis of this specific cultural thread was, of cause, especially influential to the capital milieus of Copenhagen. And as such, fertilized both the forthcoming (as well as the realization) of the exhibition concept. Thus it was pointed out time and again by Philip Schou; the expo took place to create a platform foremost for the Danish citizens. So they would recognize the completeness of the national splendours; the products, lifestyles, and arts from all of Denmark. 
Likewise it was exactly the national aspects that knitted the different interests together in the organising assembly of the exhibition. Surely conflicts could not be avoided. Nevertheless, the corporation was fueled with the knowledge that the buzzing combatants in the end belonged to the same hive.

==Industrial art==

=== Industrial art and responsibility ===

An everlasting cause to conflicts in the exhibition committee was the question of how [[industrial art]] should be part of the scenario. To Philip Schou and those who had supported his idea from the beginning it was exactly the innermost mission of the exhibition to advocate that concept.

Simply put industrial art consisted of reminiscences of romantic thoughts, combined with a critic attitude towards the modern times. The concept included a belief in a certain ‘spirit’ of the ethnic, which in short meant that individual groups upheld certain characteristics. And that these characteristic was somehow manifest in the products created by the people.

It is no wonder that followers of this idea comprehended the introduction of machinery in the latter half of 1800 highly negatively. The machineries tended to exclude the human touch to the products. Which therefore did not become impregnated with the ‘folkgeist’ but became utterly ‘soulless.’ In that respect, the primary challenge of the modern age consisted in finding a method to keep the human touch attached to the products.

The solution was Industrial art. Defined as middle sized [[factory|factories]] that kept on using manpower in as many areas as possible, only reserving the hardest work to the machine. Surely this line of reasoning was not attractive to all branches, but primary to those that already included an aspect of ‘artful expression’ to the final product. Needless to mention, almost all the eight originators belonged to such branches.

=== Prevention of national disaster ===

The concept of industrial art had ability to reach further, than to those already in the branch. This was due to developments in economic thinking. From that direction it was stated that to be successful in the world marked that emerged in the second half of the 1800, every country would have to specialise in a range of products.

The outcome of this consideration combined with the idea of industrial art was clear cut. For a small state like Denmark the way to survive on the world marked, was to specialise in areas where the folkgeist could shine through. In fact this was not as a situation of choice, but as a necessity!

In the age of the exhibition the high-pitched voices than announced the last sentence, belonged to a minority. However, due to special circumstances that emerged in Denmark after 1864, there was a widespread fear that the nation was on its way to ruin. This fear was pregnant even in places like the [[Administration (government)|administration]]. And it made many ears and minds perceptible to voices (no matter how high-pinched) which brought forward solutions to prevent the end.

Nevertheless, there was a continuous fight in the exhibition committee on the subject of industrial art. The majority of the committee members outright disagreed that this line of thoughts should be placed at the front of the exhibition, and thereby state that the organizing body as a whole supported the idea. This battle of expositional ideology was won by the originators. The Copenhagen Exhibition was first and foremost a tribute to the concept of industrial art.

== Nordic brotherhood ==

The life source in [[Scandinavia]] has been drawn from the same well since the dawn of days, one of the more originators wrote dreamingly some years before the exhibition. The kinfolks of Denmark, [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] are thus distinguishable from the others, and yet inevitable entangled. The poetic claim was not utterly out of reason, at least not seen from the second half of the 1800. The centuries that could be looked back upon then, were in many ways defined by regional Nordic unity or at least highly intermingled developing patterns.

One of the step stones towards the realization of the expo was therefore to call upon the neighbours and invite them to party. This would make it possible to get a survey of the standpoint of the Nordic countries in the areas of industry, agriculture, and art. And it would also be a reminder to the crowds of modern age of their common heritage.

From a strategic position the talk of brotherhood was a further [[avocation]] of the subject of industrial art. A Nordic home marked -secured by trade walls- would ensure a nice stable growth of the many small and middle sized factory units in the region.

However, at this point in the chain of reasoning the originator was oddly silent. The reason to this was most probably that talk of Nordic unity could cause implications to the Danish foreign policies. The policy towards Europe’s strongest power was in short to ensure that absolutely no steps were taken that could be comprehended ‘negative.’ Talk of a protected Scandinavian marked that would exclude Germany, but include Finland (satellite of Russia) did not fit into that line of policy.

The motives to arrange an exhibition where a good many – Surely not all of them where outspoken right away.

== Exhibition support ==

The way towards the expo was first and foremost a stony road of hard work. As mentioned the idea was fostered by Philip Schou in 1883, the very same year he became chairman of the Association of Copenhagen Industrialist. Since its foundation in the 1840s the association was meant to act as a dynamic forefront of modern age. This by introducing newly developed wonders (machineries, mostly) that with success could be implemented by society. But in the span of years that proceeded Philip Schou’s entry as chairman this work had had bad conditions. Primary because the membership profile of the association had changed. Reports suggest that a majority of members in the late 1870s comprehended the membership as a club membership, with the weight on relaxation facilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

When Philip Schou introduced a range of measures to promote industrial art, he faced negative response from a majority of the members. However, a minority was able to commit the association in the aforementioned direction, likely a result of the status they held. This minority was influential due to their significant representation in different boards of the association. And also several were sons of the association’s founding fathers. In short, the group of originators looked like a coherent minority.

The reality of the proposal was that the exposition did not require much funding in terms of money. The heavy workload that would be involve would be purely voluntary. So even though the idea may not have been what the majority distinctly wanted, it could not really be seen harmful to other interests in the association. In a far from unanimous state of mind, the Association of Copenhagen Industrialist therefore in 1884, undertook the enormous responsibility to organize the exhibition of 1888.

== Exposition committee==

Institutions as such did not always correspond to the originators view on which connections was needed to fulfill the project. This was reflected in a schedule made in the beginning of 1885 consisting of those who were to participate. Some of the men on the list did not belong to any organisation. Rather they represented what must be recognized as political, royal, and economic spheres of society.

It is hardly a surprise that a broad basis of interest was desirable to secure the project. Which indicate that membership of the committee was not limited to institutions. In general this point towards a scrutiny of the role individuals was to have in the committee of organisations. For example, most of the institutions that were permitted to join the committee did so by invitation. These typical contained not only the number of seats available for the specific institution, but furthermore the names of those individuals who were designated to the seats.

Actually the originators sometimes comprehended the institutions as trade able cards. This was apparent as the Royal Agrarian Society joined the committee. As the society’s members arrived they stated that they also represented 3 other organisations, which thereby joined the committee. Due the fact that admission to the committee for these new organisations had corresponded closely to the individuals’ admittance by the committee’s invitation, it was shown that individuals was recognised on a level just as important as the institutions.

Sometimes the importance of institutions was even overruled by persons, as seen in the case of the Royal academy of Art. The head of the academy did not particularly wanted the academy to participate, whereas the committee was interested in its participation, but wanted to avoid the director. This situation was at a deadlock for more than a year, until members at the academy finally decided to take matter into hands and inform committee, as well as director, that they would represent the academy.

== Epilogue ==

By the 1880s the romantic thoughts of Industrial art was anachronistic. The idea consisted both of a belief in qualities of the ethnic bloodline which was reflected in the handiwork. As well as it required extraordinary political will, to impose the implications hereof into the realms of real life. To turn ordinary and educated men on that kind of scheme was uphill all the way.

Nevertheless, this was what the group of originators aimed at by arranging the Expo. It must be concluded they failed. Rather it seems like a majority of the involved went along for the roller coaster ride. This is not to say that the expo did not cause any or long lasting results. On the contrary it did; in almost infinite numbers. But the flourishing of Industrial art was not one of them. Rather the concept was placed in a museum, where it is still to be enjoyed today.

A '''novelogue''' is a story told almost exclusively through dialogue. Character descriptions, and settings are minimally provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novelogue : Dialogic Storytelling|url=http://www.novelogue.com/|work=webpage|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

A "[[novel]]" or "prose novel" is defined as: "A novel is a book of long narrative in literary prose. The genre has historical roots both in the fields of the medieval and early modern romance and in the tradition of the novella. The latter supplied the present generic term in the late 18th century...

A novelogue is a combination between the words "novel" and "dialogue", and it is written more like a screenplay than a novel.  Prose are only used in brief segments of the story where character and setting descriptions are necessary.  Otherwise, the story is told through conversation.  Characters enter and exit as if moving around a world stage, like they would in a [[screenplay]] or [[Play (theatre)|stage play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novelogue|url=http://www.adamsbook.com/supplementalMaterial.aspx|publisher=Adams Book Company|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novelogue is also considered a form of "dialogic storytelling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Allyssa|title=Developing narrative structure|year=1991|isbn=978-0-8058-0475-1|pages=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0scdDeKnj0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=dialogic+storytelling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bFq_18gOea&amp;sig=GaRO80bQAmcBXs87_s1uHvyYTeE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SwLbTtTOEofV0QHRyPTBDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialogic%20storytelling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1800 Wilkinson Map of the 4 Eastern Churches rectified.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Orient of the [[Roman Empire]] and its ecclesiastical order after the [[Council of Chalcedon]], 451]]
The '''Orient''' is a historical term for the ''East'', traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the [[Eastern world]], in relation to [[Europe]]. In [[English language|English]], it is largely a [[metonym]] for, and coterminous with, the [[continent]] of [[Asia]], loosely classified into the [[Near East]], [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]]: the directional regions now known today as western Asia, southern Asia, eastern Asia, and southeast Asia (Note that traditionally directional regions of a continent do not use an upper-case letter). Originally, the term ''Orient'' was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East.  
 
The term '''Oriental''' is often used to describe objects from the Orient. However, given its [[Eurocentric]] connotations and shifting, inaccurate definition through the ages, it is generally considered offensive as a label for people from Asia.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oriental|title=Definition of ORIENTAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oriental|title=oriental - Definition of oriental in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/oriental|title=Oriental definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weareresonate.com/2016/07/oriental-racist-term/|title=FEATURE: Why is 'Oriental' a racist term? - Resonate|date=13 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mike-francesa-oriental_us_59495b61e4b07d3e35d8b58f|title=New York Sports Talk Show Host Doesn't Get Why 'Oriental' Is Offensive|date=20 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tronc.com/gdpr/latimes.com/|title=Los Angeles Times - We are currently unavailable in your region|website=www.tronc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/avoid-these-five-racial-terms-2834959|title=Why You Should Avoid These Racial Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/outdated-term-oriental-has-no-place-at-city-hall-prof-1.711485|title=Outdated term 'Oriental' has no place at city hall: prof - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/bill-remove-oriental-federal-law-passes-senate-heads-obama-n571506|title=Bill to Remove 'Oriental' from Federal Law Passes Senate, Heads to Obama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
[[File:Roman Empire with dioceses in 300 AD.png|thumb|330px|right|Administrative Dioceses of the Roman Empire, c. 300, including the original [[Diocese of the Orient]]]]
The term "Orient" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''oriens'' meaning "east" (lit. "rising" &lt; ''orior'' " rise"). The use of the word for "rising" to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages: compare the terms "[[Levant]]" (&lt; French ''levant'' "rising"), "Vostok" {{lang-ru|Восток}} (&lt; Russian ''voskhod'' {{lang-ru|восход}} "sunrise"), "[[Anatolia]]" (&lt; Greek ''anatole''), "[[mizrahi]]" in [[Hebrew]] ("zriha" meaning sunrise), "sharq" {{lang-ar|شرق}} (&lt; Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yashriq}}'' {{lang|ar|يشرق}} "rise", ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shurūq}}'' {{lang-ar|شروق}} "rising"), "shygys" {{lang-kz|шығыс}} (&lt; Kazakh ''shygu'' {{lang-kz|шығу}} "come out"), {{lang-tr|doğu}} (&lt; Turkish ''doğmak'' to be born; to rise), {{zh|東}} ({{zh|hp=dōng}}, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Harbaugh | first1 = Rick | title = Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary | chapter = 東 | publisher = Han Lu Book &amp; Pub. Co. | year = 1998 | page = 227 | url = http://zhongwen.com/d/170/x70.htm | accessdate = 26 October 2010 | isbn = 0-9660750-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "[[The Land of the Rising Sun]]" to refer to [[Japan]].  Also, many ancient temples, including pagan temples and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East.  This tradition was  [[Orientation of churches|carried on in Christian churches]]. To situate them in such a manner was to "orient" them in the proper direction.  When something was facing the correct direction, it was said to be in the proper ''orientation''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another explanation of the term stems from [[Rome]] during the [[Roman Empire]], specifically the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], or the "Roman Orient", during the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the original East-West (or Orient-Occident) line was the [[Italian Peninsula]]'s East Coast, around 600 AD this would shift to the [[City of Rome]]. Any area below the City of Rome was considered the Orient, as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land, such as [[Dalmatian Italian]]s, (modern [[Naples|Neapolitans]] along with [[Sicily|Sicilians]], [[Libyan people|Libyans]], [[Moroccan people|Moroccans]], [[Greeks]], etc.), as well as everything East of Southern Italy, hence the Italian name "Italia nord-orientale" (in English [[Northeast Italy]]) for Le [[Tre Venezie]] (the 3 Venices) located above the Roman latitude line separating it from modern [[Abruzzo]]; the beginning of the Orient in the East, while [[Lazio]] is its beginning in the West of the [[Italian Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The opposite term "[[Western world|Occident]]" derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''occidens'', meaning ''west'' (lit. ''setting'' &lt; ''occido'' ''fall/set''). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favor of "[[Western world]]".

== History of the term ==
{{Further|Orientalism}}
[[File:Dioecesis Orientis 400 AD.png|thumb|270px|right|Late Roman [[Diocese of the Orient]], c. 400]]
Territorialization of the Roman term ''Orient'' occurred during the reign of emperor [[Diocletian]] (284-305), when the [[Diocese of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Dioecesis Orientis'') was formed. Later in the 4th century, the [[Praetorian prefecture of the Orient]] ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Praefectura Praetorio Orientis'') was also formed, including most of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], from the [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]] eastwards; its easternmost part was the original ''Diocese of the Orient'', corresponding roughly to the [[region of Syria]]. 

Over time, the common understanding of "the Orient" has continually shifted eastwards, as European people traveled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call "the [[Far East]]". These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where "the Orient" and "Oriental" have kept their older meanings (e.g., "Oriental spices" typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travelers may again take the [[Orient Express]] train from [[Paris]] to its terminus in the European part of [[Istanbul]], a route established in the early 20th century.

In European [[historiography]], the meaning of "the Orient" changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], and adjoining areas.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Martin W.|last2=Wigen|first2=Kären|title=The myth of continents: a critique of metageography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2as0sWxFBAC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=8 November 2011|year=1997|publisher=University ù Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; as far west as [[Morocco]]. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered "the Orient" as just [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and eastern [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; As recently as the early 20th century, the term "Orient" often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], and peninsular Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt; Throughout the history of the changing sense of the term, "the Orient" was never equivalent to Asia as a whole. "The Orient" being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia—[[Siberia]] most notably—were excluded from the scholarly notion of "the Orient".&lt;ref name="LewisWigen1997"/&gt;

Equally valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as [[Oriental studies]] (now Asian Studies in some countries).

The adjectival term Oriental has been used by [[Western world|the West]] to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. "Oriental" means generally "[[east]]ern". It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the [[Eastern world|Orient]] or "East" (for [[Asia]]), and especially of its [[Eastern culture]]. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated "Ori".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooke|Hooke, Robert]]. 1666. [[:File:Saturn Robert Hooke 1666.jpg|Drawing of Saturn]] in Philosophical Transactions (Royal Society publication) Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and look at old world maps and celestial for sources., and so on --&gt; In contemporary American English, ''Oriental'' usually refers to things from the parts of [[East Asia]] traditionally occupied by [[East Asian]]s and most [[Central Asians]] and [[Southeast Asians]] racially categorized as "[[Mongoloid]]". This excludes [[Jewish diaspora|Jews]], [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]], and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] prohibits the word "Oriental" in legislation and government documents, preferring the word "Asian" instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf Senate bill (pdf file)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305151322/http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2001-02/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5954.PL.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more local uses, "oriental" is also used for eastern parts of countries, for example [[Oriental (Morocco)|Morocco's Oriental Region]]. Oriental is also used as an adjective akin to "eastern", especially in the Spanish-speaking world. For example, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] islands of [[Mindoro Island|Mindoro]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]] are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words "oriental" and "occidental" respectively. The official name of [[Uruguay]] is the República Oriental del Uruguay or Oriental Republic of Uruguay because it is east of the [[Uruguay River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html#Govt|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, "orientalist" has been the traditional term for a scholar of [[Oriental studies]]; however, the use in [[English language|English]] of "Orientalism" to describe academic "Oriental studies" is rare: the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites only one such usage, by [[Lord Byron]] in 1812. [[Orientalism]] is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in "Oriental" subjects, often drawing on their travels to [[North Africa]] and [[Western Asia]]. Artists as well as scholars were already described as "Orientalists" in the 19th century. In 1978, Palestinian-American scholar [[Edward Said]] published his influential and controversial book, ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]''; he used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]]s, shaped by the attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Nosal, K R.

=== British and Irish English ===
In [[British English]], the term ''Oriental'' is sometimes used to refer to people from East and Southeast Asia (such as those from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Viet Nam|Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Laos]]). "Asian" in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] generally refers to people that come from [[South Asia]] (in particular [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Maldives]]) since [[British Asians]] make up approximately 6.9% of the population within the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-the-united-kingdom---part-1/rft-ks201uk.xls|title=2011 Census: Ethnic group, local authorities in the United Kingdom|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Orientals" refers exclusively to people of East and Southeast Asian origin, who comprise 0.7% of the UK population as a whole, and 5.3% of the non-European population.

Distinct within American culture, some [[American English]] speakers consider the term "Oriental" to be a pejorative and disparaging term when used to describe a person&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at [[New York University]], said the basic critique of the term developed in the U.S. in the 1970s. Tchen has said: "With the U.S.A. anti-war movement in the '60s and early '70s, many Asian Americans identified the term 'Oriental' with a Western process of racializing Asians as forever opposite 'others'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/livewire/archived/oriental_rugs_or_people/|title=Oriental: Rugs or People?|work=nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 American press release related to legislation aimed at removing the term "oriental" from official documents of the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], Governor [[David Paterson]] said: "The word 'oriental' does not describe ethnic origin, background or even race; in fact, it has deep and demeaning historical roots".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackradionetwork.com/ny_law_ends_use_of_oriental_in_documents official 2009 press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212084814/http://www.blackradionetwork.com/ny_law_ends_use_of_oriental_in_documents |date=12 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian English ===
In [[Australian English]], the term "Asian" generally refers to people of [[East Asia]]n or [[Southeast Asia]]n descent, such as those of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Filipino descent. Persons of  Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and most other [[South Asian]] descent are referred to by their respective [[demonym]], but without explicit knowledge, those people are indeterminately inferred as "Indian".

=== German ===
In [[German language|German]], ''Orient'' is usually used synonymously with the area between the [[Near East]] and [[India]], including [[Israel]], the [[Arab world]], and [[Greater Persia]].

The term ''Asiaten'' (English: Asians) means the people of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Another word for Orient in German is ''Morgenland'' (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as "morning land". The antonym "Abendland" (rarely: "Okzident") is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.

[[File:New Living Pictures (8617836771).jpg|thumb|[[Dublin tramways]] running through Parnell Square and [[O'Connell Street]] in the [[Edwardian era]].]]

'''Parnell Square''' ({{Irish place name|Cearnóg Parnell|no_translate=yes}}) is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[town square|square]] sited at the northern end of [[O'Connell Street]], and west of [[Mountjoy Square]], in the city of [[Dublin]] (now Dublin 1), Ireland.

Formerly named ''Rutland Square'', it was renamed after [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846–1891), as was [[Parnell Street]], which forms the southern side of the square. Surrounded on three sides by terraces of original intact [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian houses]], much of the southern part of the square and its centre is taken up by extensions of the [[Rotunda Hospital]]. The [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] is located along the northern side of this area. Its main entrance is on the eastern side of the square, with a smaller entrance on the northern side of the square.

In the south easterly corner of the square, where it meets with O'Connell Street, is sited the [[Gate Theatre]], and the Ambassador and Pillar Room venues. Entertainments were originally developed here as part of the Rotunda Hospital scheme by [[Bartholomew Mosse]] as a revenue engine to pay for the running of what was Europe's first lying-in maternity hospital. Extensive pleasure gardens, subsequently forming the body of the square, were located to the rear of the hospital in the original development.

The [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery]] is on the north side of the square. It was erected in cut stone by [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] to a design by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] during the Georgian period. On this side also is the [[Dublin Writers Museum]] and the Irish Writers' Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writerscentre.ie Irish Writer's Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; The striking [[Gothic Revival]] Findlater's Church ([[Abbey Presbyterian Church, Dublin|Abbey Presbyterian Church]]) just up from the gallery on the same side was erected in the 1860s by Alexander Findlater, at his own expense, and which he presented to the [[Presbyterian]] congregation. One of Dublin's most acclaimed{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} restaurants, Michelin Star since 2007, ''Chapter One'', is located on the northern side of Parnell Square between the [[Hugh Lane Gallery]] and the Writers Museum. On the south side of the square is Conway's bar (now closed), outside of which [[Pearse]] surrendered to the [[British Army]] after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. The political party [[Sinn Féin]] has its Dublin head office and shop on the western side of the square.  The western side also is known for offices of a number of [[Irish Congress of Trades Unions|trades unions]] and other organisations.  Also on the western side is the St. Martin's Apostolate office, which includes a small basement chapel.  The St. Martin's Apostolate office is well known in Dublin for its moving [[Nativity scene|crib]] that is open to the public each Christmas.

A friend of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and the writers [[WB Yeats]] and [[James Joyce]], Gogarty was unwillingly immortalised as [[Buck Mulligan]] in the ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. From the early 1920s until the early 1930s No 5 served as headquarters of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], the governing party.

No 9 Cavendish Row – Dr [[Bartholomew Mosse]] (1713–1759); Philanthropist and surgeon. Mosse lived here, having originally hailed from Portlaoise. He founded the Rotunda Hospital, located in the square and which was built to designs of [[Richard Cassels]] between 1751 and 1757. The emergence of Parnell Square as a square is largely attributable to the pleasure gardens him as he laid out pleasure gardens to pay for the hospital.

No. 14 Parnell Square was the headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge in the 1940s and 1950s and perhaps into the 1960s. The Ard-chraobh of the Gaelic League was in this building.

No 25 Parnell Square, Gaelic League building. This building is of great significance during the period surrounding the War of Independence as it was here on 9 September 1914 that a meeting held by Supreme Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) with selected others agreed to rise up against the British before the Great War, subsequently known as the [[First World War]], would be finished: In attendance were [[Eamonn Ceannt]], [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[James Connolly]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[John MacBride]], [[Sean MacDermott]], Sean McGarry, William "Bill" O'Brien, [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], [[Padraig Pearse]], [[Joseph Plunkett]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

No 29 – 30 Parnell Square – Formerly Vaughan's Hotel; a favourite hiding and meeting place for Michael Collins.

[[File:Let's Dance Memorial Parnell Square 1.jpg|thumb|right|Let's Dance memorial to the [[Miami Showband killings]] on Parnell Square North]] 
No 41 Parnell Square – this building was formerly the Irish National Forester's Hall. Prior to 1916 it was used for drilling both by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) and the Volunteers; on the eve of the outbreak of the [[Easter Rising]] [[Éamon de Valera]] assembled the 3rd Battalion here. In 1922, subsequent to the Treaty and prior to the Civil War, the IRB again met here in a failed attempt at achieving consensus on the Treaty; among the attendees were Michael Collins, [[Harry Boland]], [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] – all of whom, with the exception of O'Duffy, were dead by the end of the [[Irish Civil War]].

No 44 Parnell Square – The [[Kevin Barry]] memorial hall is the current headquarters of [[Sinn Féin]].

No 46 Parnell Square – Formerly the Headquarters of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], the Irish language league, this was the venue where [[Thomas MacDonagh]] assembled the 2nd Battalion the Sunday night on the eve of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. In August 1917, the meetings that led to the National Executive of the [[Irish Republican Army]] being established were also here, with persons present including Éamon de Valera, [[Thomas Ashe]], [[Cathal Brugha]], and Michael Collins. Subsequently on 19 September 1919, in the company of [[Richard Mulcahy]], Michael Collins set up his famous "Squad", composed of top-level operatives – men who would ultimately be involved with highest priority missions, such as the elimination of the British "G Men" agents in 1920.

No 58 Parnell Square – The Sinn Féin Bookshop and the offices of the ''[[An Phoblacht]]'' newspaper.

==Future development==
[[File:Parnell Square North.jpg|thumb|left|The northern side of Parnell Square, with the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] at left, [[Hugh Lane Gallery]] recessed at right, and former Coláiste Mhuire buildings at far end]]

In June 2015, plans were revealed for the development of the northern side of Parnell Square into a cultural district. The street will be turned into a pedestrian space, the city's main library will move to the former Coláiste Mhuire buildings, a new auditorium will be built, and the gardens attached to the Rotunda Hospital will be opened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/parnell-square-cultural-quarter-green-light-for-60m-project-1.2237898|title=Parnell Square cultural quarter?

'''''Paws and Whiskers''''' is a 2014 fundraising anthology for the [[Battersea Dogs and Cats Home]], featuring some of the best children's stories about cats and dogs of all time, selected by multi-award-winning and best-selling children's author [[Jacqueline Wilson]], with illustrations by [[Nick Sharratt]]. Published 13 February 2014 by Doubleday Children's, the book includes a new story by Wilson, ''Leonie's Pet Cat'', as well as extracts from such classics as [[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]], by Dodie Smith, and [[Through the Looking Glass]] by Lewis Carroll.&lt;ref name=AmazonToc&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0857533525/ref=sib_dp_bod_toc?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S009#reader-link Paws and Whiskers preview: Table of Contents]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Richards''' is both an artist and [[curator]] living and working in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], since 1994. Born in Cardiff in 1970, Richards studied a BA in Fine Art at Howard Gardens, Cardiff, part of the [[University of Wales]]. He moved to Northern Ireland to further his studies, completing an MPhil. entitled "Representations of Representations" in 1998 at the [[University of Ulster]]. He has been director of the [[Golden Thread Gallery]] in Belfast since 2002.

==Artist==
Early in his career Richards was producing predominantly [[video art]] works. These works generally took the form of single-channel installations, featuring the artist perform to camera, such as his "Untitled: table &amp; chair".&lt;ref&gt;Art Action 1958–1998, editions Intervention, p424-426. {{ISBN|2-920500-19-8}} [http://isbndb.com/d/book/art_action_1958_1998.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-1990s he began creating [[performance art]] works and photographic documentation of the performance art as a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;McAvera, Brian, Standing in the Way of Control, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|978-0-903009-91-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer, Joshua, Conflict of Interest: Performance as a Spectator, Performance Research Journal, Volume 5.1, Spring {{ISBN|0-415-24102-2}} [http://isbndb.com/d/book/performance_research_v5_issu_1.html], [[Routledge]] – 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of "performance lucida" series took place as part of House Style, a group event at The Bedroom Gallery (The Bedroom Gallery later went on to become BoBo's in London) in the east of Belfast. His first solo exhibition took place at the Context Gallery, Derry, as part of Beyond Borders Plus and was entitled ''Corrective Perspective''. The work was in three parts, the first an installation featuring a pulley system and the gallery being divided into two, one brightly lit and the other in complete darkness. The second part featured a performance that saw the artist hung upside down from the pulley system and swing toward the dividing wall. The audience had been assembled in the darkened space to witness a live project, caused due to a pinhole in the wall, onto three large sheets of previously unexposed photographic paper.

The nature of the projection inverted the image of the artist, who appeared on the screen to be performing a series of gravity defying acts. When the performance was complete, the artist was lowered from the pulley system. He then came through to the darkened space and proceeded to process the now exposed photographic paper. He put forward that the audience had witnessed the documentation of the action/event rather the action/event itself. The third part of the work saw the photographic paper installed in the gallery with the residue from the event.
Richards developed a significant body of works exploring the representations of documentation of performance art as featured in publications. He also created a series of "collective histories" of performance art works.&lt;ref&gt;Hanrahan, Suin, "Peter Richards: Photographing Performance", ''[[Source (photography magazine)|Source]]'', No.20, pp. 30–31, Autumn.&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that these works acted as a model for simple contradicts between knowledge and experience that are formative of our understanding.&lt;ref&gt;New Contemporaries 99, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9515556-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently Richards has explored other aspects of our interpretation of representations, focusing in particular on the subject of 'memorials'&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Richards, Dogs Have No Religion, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|80-7056-138-6}} [http://www.britishcouncil.org/czechrepublic-arts-viusal-arts-dogs-have-no-religion.htm]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, Jennifer.L., "On The Walls in Belfast", ''Afterimage'', Vol. 26, No. 5, March/April.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portraits from a 50's Archive, [[Belfast Exposed]], catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9524217-6-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally most notably participating in first presentation at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mulholland, Suzanna Chan, Michele Robecchi, ''The Nature of Things'', British Council &amp; Arts Council of Northern Ireland, catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9540086-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator==
When Richards began his professional career in Belfast in the mid-1990s he was working both as an artist and as a curator. He was based at [[Catalyst Arts]], Northern Ireland's pioneering contemporary visual arts, artist-run organisation (est 1994) between 1996 and 1998. Since his time at Catalyst Arts Richards has worked as a guest curator at the Context Gallery in Derry and at the Old Museum Arts Centre in Belfast. His curatorial contribution to contemporary art in Northern Ireland is best known for his work at the [[Golden Thread Gallery]], where he has worked since 2001, to profile established contemporary Northern Irish artists, such as: [[Lisa Byrne]], Ian Charlesworth, Colin Darke, [[Willie Doherty]], Susan MacWilliam, [[Mary McIntyre]], Locky Morris, Philip Napier, Aisling O'Beirn, [[Paul Seawright]], Dan Shipsides, [[Victor Sloan]]. He has also worked with their peers internationally, such as [[William Kentridge]], Destiny Deacon, Marjectica Potrc, Azorro Group, [[Zbigniew Libera]], Shane Cullen, Delcy Morelos, Gerald Byrne. Richards has worked closely with a number of younger artists creating a platform for them to develop their practice.

'''Phallus paintings''' in [[Bhutan]] are esoteric symbols, which have their origins in the [[Chimi Lhakhang]] monastery near [[Punakha]], the former capital of Bhutan. The village monastery was built in honour of Lama [[Drukpa Kunley]] who lived in the 15-16th century and who was popularly known as the "Mad Saint" ([[nyönpa]]) or “Divine Madman” for his unorthodox ways of teaching, which amounted to being bizarre and shocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phallus: Crazy Wisdom from Bhutan|year=2014|publisher=ButterLamp Publishers|location=Bhutan|isbn=978-9993691174|url=https://www.amazon.com/Phallus-Wisdom-Bhutan-Karma-Choden/dp/9993691178/|author=Karma Choden|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These explicit paintings, though embarrassing to many urbanites now (this folk culture is now informally discouraged in urban centres&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutansociety.org/newsletter/41.pdf|title=The Decline of the Phallus|publisher=Bhutan Society|accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), can be seen painted on the walls of houses and buildings throughout Bhutan, particularly in villages, and are credited as Kunley's creations.&lt;ref name=British&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm|title=Bhutan's phalluses warn off evil|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | date=2005-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Lindsey |author2=Bradley Mayhew |author3=Stan Armington |author4=Richard Whitecross|title=Bhutan|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=1-74059-529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally symbols of an erect penis in Bhutan have been intended to drive away the evil eye and malicious gossip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan: aspects of culture and development|publisher=Issue 5 of Kiscadale Asia research series, Kiscadale|author=Aris, Michael, Hutt, Michael|year=1994|isbn=1-870838-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the history of use of phallus symbols is traced to Drukpa Kunley, the studies carried out at the Center of Bhutan Studies (CBS) have inferred that the phallus was an integral part of the early [[ethnic religion]] that existed in Bhutan before [[Buddhism]] became the state religion and is associated with [[Bon]]. In Bon, phallus was integral to all rituals.&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_art_phallus.php|title=Arts and Crafts of Bhutan|work=The Phallus : an arcane symbol|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Keys to Bhutan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127022531/http://www.keystobhutan.com/bhutan/bhutan_art_phallus.php|archivedate=2013-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dasho Lam Sanga, a former principal of the Institute of Language and Culture Studies (ILCS), while stating that there are no written documents on it, elaborates: "But the worship of the phallus was believed to be in practice even before the arrival of [[Padmasambhava|Guru Rinpoche]] and Shabdrung [[Ngawang Namgyal]]&amp;nbsp;... What we know about it is what we heard from our forefathers."&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

The phallic symbols are, however, generally not depicted in community temples and [[dzong architecture|dzongs]], which are places of worship where [[lama]]s or [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]] who have adopted celibate lifestyles and pursue divine ideals live. However, rural and ordinary houses continue to display them.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name=Observe&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/2009/readers-voices/09/the-decline-of-the-phallus.html|title=The decline of the phallus|accessdate=2010-08-09|publisher=Bhutan Observer|date=2009-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808015906/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/2009/readers-voices/09/the-decline-of-the-phallus.html|archive-date=2010-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The often mentioned origin of the symbolic phallus is as a legacy of the popular Bhutanese saint [[Drukpa Kunley]] (1455–1529).&lt;ref name="Brown, p.79"&gt;Brown, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Kunley migrated from Tibet, was trained in [[Ralung Monastery]] in [[Tibet]], and belonged to the period of [[Pema Lingpa]] and was his disciple. He was a crazy saint who extensively travelled in Bhutan, who was fond of women and wine, and adopted blasphemous and unorthodox ways of teaching Buddhism. His sexual exploits included his hosts and promoters. He was utterly devoid of all social conventions and called himself the "Madman from Kyishodruk."

Drukpa Kunley's intention was to shock the clergy, who were uppity and prudish in their behaviour and teachings of Buddhism. However, his ways appealed to lay practitioners. It was he who propagated the legend of painting phalluses on walls and flying hanging phalluses from roof tops of houses to drive away evil spirits and subdue demonesses.&lt;ref name="Brown, p.136"&gt;Brown, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; He is, therefore, also called the "fertility saint", as the [[monastery]] he built, [[Chimi Lhakhang]], is visited by not only [[Bhutan]]ese women but also people from the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].

Kunley's organ, as painted, is called the "Thunderbolt of Flaming Wisdom" as it unnerved demons and demonesses and subdued them. It is also said that he is "perhaps the only saint in the religions of the world who is almost exclusively identified with phallus and its creative power". It is for this reason that his phallus, as a symbol, is depicted in paintings on the walls of the houses, and he is shown in [[thangka]] paintings holding a "wooden stick with penis head".&lt;ref name=Winer&gt;{{Cite book|last=Winer|first= Jerome A.|author2=James William Anderson|title= Psychoanalysis and history|pages=200–201|accessdate=2010-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3mR8TSnnIwC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=Phallic+paintings+in+Bhutan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7l9eTLq4NseqcbvtldsO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-88163-399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chimi Lhakhang Divine Madman Monestary 1500.jpg|thumb|[[Chimi Lhakhang]], established by [[Drukpa Kunley]] and is known for its wooden phalluses.]]
The ''nyönpa'' lived in a place known as Lobesa close to Chimi Lhakhang to drive away demonesses and protect the local people. According to the legend, he used to hit the evil forces with his penis (or cohabited with them) and turn them into protective deities.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt; Chimi Lhakhang was built in the mad saint's honour by his cousin on a hillock (this hillock was called by Kunley a "woman's breast") in a valley for the good deeds done to his people by subduing the evil forces and demonesses with his "magic thunderbolt of wisdom". It was built in 1499 with a square plan and a golden spire. It is approached from the Yowakha village, and all the houses on the way are painted with phallic symbols.

The monastery now houses several wooden phalluses including a silver-handled phallus (the "Lama's Thunderbolt"), which the mad saint is supposed to have brought from Tibet. This is now frequently used by the current [[lama]] of the monastery to hit women on the head as a blessing to beget children. The monastery is also enshrined with a statue of Lama Kunley with his pet dog Sachi. Images of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Avalokiteśvara]] are also deified in the monastery. Women come to the monastery seeking blessings of children by getting hit on the head by the presiding lama with wooden and [[bone]] phalluses. The name of the yet-to-be-born child is also chosen by picking bamboo slips placed in the altar inscribed with names of boys and girls. It is also said that the small [[stupa]] at the altar was made by Kunley himself.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.145"&gt;Brown, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued  by social science researchers that the phallus is a representation of "Worldly illusion of desires", and it is said that as a symbol of power and fertility of the [[Animism|animists]] of the [[Bon|Bön religion]], the phallus's representation got enmeshed with Buddhism in Bhutan. Similar phallic depictions can be found in [[Thailand]], [[Bali]], and in other cultures.&lt;ref name=Linda&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marriedtobhutan.com/2010/02/dragon-and-phallus.html|title=Married to Bhutan|work=Dragon and Phallus|author=Linda York Leaming|date=2010-02-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608073126/http://www.marriedtobhutan.com/2010/02/dragon-and-phallus.html|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anecdotes and practices===
Several anecdotes are told of the zany ways of Drukpa Kunley. It is said that on a particular occasion he was gifted a sacred thread to put around his neck. However, he shocked the people by saying that he would tie the thread around his penis with the fond hope that it would bring him "luck with the ladies".&lt;ref name="Brown, p.136"&gt;Brown, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some communities in eastern Bhutan, every year during a particular period, phalluses are worshipped with flowers, ''[[ara (drink)|ara]]'' (red colored hooch) and milk, in an effort to seek protection from the evil spirits. In central Bhutan, a wooden phallus is immersed in the cups before the drinks are offered to the guests.&lt;ref name=key/&gt; Some phalluses, especially in rural Bhutan, are endowed with comic eyes.&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt;

The phallus painting is also termed as an institutionalised [[graffiti]]. It is seen painted in different designs, and an unusual design seen is one with a [[dragon]] riding the phallus. One common feature noticed is that the phallus is always seen [[Ejaculation|ejaculating]].&lt;ref name=Linda/&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:Bhutan kitchen restaurant with phallic painting on the wall.jpg|thumb|300px|Phallic painting on the walls of the [[Bhutan Kitchen]] restaurant in [[Thimphu]].]]
The belief that such a symbol brings good luck and drives away evil spirits is so much ingrained in the psyche of the common populace in Bhutan that the symbols are routinely painted outside walls of the new houses and even painted on number plates of trucks. The carved wooden phalluses are hung (sometimes crossed by a design of sword or dagger) outside, on the eves of the new homes, at the four corners.&lt;ref name="Brown, p.144"&gt;Brown, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; 

The wooden phalluses are also driven in the agricultural fields as a kind of scarecrow, when the crops start sprouting. The ''Atsaras'' (masked clowns) also decorate their headgear with phallus painted cloth, during the popular [[Tsechu|Tsechu festival]] held every year in different monasteries throughout Bhutan. These clowns also dance with their holy whips and wooden phalluses.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.13"&gt;Brown, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; On a road drive from [[Paro airport]] to [[Thimpu]] these explicit paintings of phalluses are a common sight on “white-washed walls of homes, shops and eateries.”&lt;ref name=British/&gt;

In the Chimi Lhakhang monastery, the shrine dedicated to Drukpa Kunley, several wooden penises are seen being used to bless people who visit the monastery on pilgrimage seeking blessings to bear a child or for welfare of their children. The glaringly displayed phallus in the monastery is a brown wooden piece with a silver handle, a religious relic considered to possess divine powers and hence used for blessing the spiritually oriented people. It is also said to prevent quarrels among family members in the houses which are painted with these symbols.&lt;ref name=British/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p.79"&gt;Brown, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

==House warming ritual==
[[File:Bhutan phallus worship.jpg|alt=Bhutan phallus worship|thumb|299x299px|Village next to Fertility Temple Chimi Lhakhang where phalluses are painted on walls [http://www.onceinalifetimejourney.com/once-in-a-lifetime-journeys/asia/the-country-that-worships-the-phallus/]]]
An interesting ritual is performed in Bhutan, as part of house warming ceremony of new houses, which entails erecting the phallus symbols at the four corners of the eaves of the house and one inside the house. It involves raising of a basket filled with the phalluses carved out of wood to the roof of the house to fix them at the four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] corners. Groups of both men and women get hired by the owner of the house in raising the basket to the roof.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

While the men pull the basket up with a rope tied securely from the roof, women try to pull it down; during this process, ribald phallic songs are sung and with every pull the people watching the fun shout "laso". A mock exercise is enacted by the men as if they have failed to lift the basket and the basket is dropped to the ground. The intention is to get free hooch (spirit) from the owner of the house so that they get energised to raise the basket. Following the free drinking binge, the men finally rise the basket to the roof and fix the phalluses at the four corners of the roof at the eve ends.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

The phalluses are also tied with a [[dagger]] (''redi'') and painted in five different colours; the colours are said to be significators of five divine expressions: "White dagger representing peace, purity, and harmony, a red coloured dagger representing wealth and power is placed on the west, the yellow dagger representing prosperity is placed on the south, and on the north is placed the green dagger representing protection. The fifth dagger placed inside the house is usually blue in colour and symbolises wisdom."&lt;ref name=key/&gt; The popular belief in fixing these symbols is that it wards off evil spirits, and not as a fertility symbol.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

==History==
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term ''pixel art'' was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, "ACM president's letter: Pixel Art", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"/&gt; [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bezier curve]], was introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]] followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"&gt;Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-23817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash]], a popular set of [[multimedia]] software used to add [[animation]] and [[interactivity]] to web pages, was introduced in 1996.

In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Art, One Click at a Time"&gt;{{cite web

In [[digital imaging]], a pixel (''pict''ure ''el''ement) is the smallest piece of information in an image.&lt;ref name="Modern Dictionary of Electronics"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Rudolf F.

==Techniques==
[[File:Plaque rue du Cirque à Paris.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Pixel art outside the virtual domain using mosaic tiles by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]]]
[[File:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

The total number of pixels (''[[image resolution]]''), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called ''[[color depth]]'') determine the quality of an image.  For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits.  Likewise, an image [[sample (graphics)|sample]]d at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses [[data compression]] techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to [[image compression|compression techniques]] that lose information as [[lossy compression]].

Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.  Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ([[CMYK]]) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the [[line art]], which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over [[image scanner|scanned]] drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or a [[graphics tablet]] and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling [[painting]], also exist, such as knowledge of the [[color theory]]. The limited palette often implemented into [[pixel art]] usually promotes the use of [[dithering]] in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.&lt;ref name="Flash Enabled: Fl"/&gt;

'''"Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung"''' was a 1971 essay by [[Lester Bangs]], later collected in a [[Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock 'n' Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock 'n' Roll|book of the same name]] ({{ISBN|0-679-72045-6}}). The essay, which talks about what is today called [[garage rock]], contains the phrase, "...punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the [[Yardbirds]]' sound." This is believed to be one of the first uses of the word "[[punk rock|punk]]" to refer to a type of [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester Bangs|Bangs, Lester]] (ed. [[Greil Marcus]]) (1987, 2003).

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''retrospective''' (from [[Latin]] ''retrospectare'', "look back"), generally, is a look back at events that took place, or works that were produced, in the past. As a noun, ''retrospective'' has specific meanings in medicine, software development, popular culture and the arts. It is applied as an adjective, synonymous with the term ''[[wikt:retroactive|retroactive]]'', to laws, standards, and awards.

==Medicine==
A [[Medicine|medical]] retrospective is an examination of a patient's [[medical history]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].

==Arts and popular culture==
A retrospective exhibition presents works from an extended period of an artist's activity. Similarly, a retrospective [[compilation album]] is assembled from a recording artist's past material, usually their [[greatest hits]]. A television or newsstand special about an actor, politician, or other celebrity will present a retrospective of the subject's career highlights. A leading (usually elderly) academic may be honored with a [[Festschrift]], an honorary book of articles or a lecture series relating topically to a retrospective of the honoree's career. Celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] good-naturedly mock the career of the guest of honor, often in a retrospective format.

==Awards==
A retrospective or retroactive award is one which is created and then awarded to persons who would have received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to persons who would have won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.

==Law==
The term is used in situations where the law (statutory, civil, or regulatory) is changed or reinterpreted, affecting acts committed before the alteration. When such changes make a previously committed lawful act now unlawful in a retroactive manner, this is known as an [[Ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' law]] or [[retroactive law]]. Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.

Conversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an [[amnesty law]] may decriminalize certain acts. A [[pardon]] has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An ''[[in mitius]]'' change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is [[repeal]]ed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]''.

==Software development==
{{refsection|date=April 2017}}
The term is also used in [[software engineering]], where a retrospective is a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project or process (often after an [[Iterative and incremental development|iteration]]) to discuss what was successful about the project or time period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the successes and improvements in future iterations or projects. Retrospective can be done in many different ways.

In [[Agile software development|agile development]], retrospectives play a very important role in iterative and incremental development. At the end of every iteration a retrospective is held to look for ways to improve the process for the next iteration. [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] call this the Sprint Retrospective.

==Standards==
In the context of scientific and technical standards, retrospectivity applies current norms to material that pre-dates new rules. An example of a retrospective or retroactive standard is the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN Code), a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] which governs the formal [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific naming]] of [[animal]]s, of which the 4th edition is effective since 2000. All previous editions of the ICZN Code, or previous other rules and conventions are disregarded today,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Art. 86.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and the scientific names published in former times are to be evaluated only under the present edition of the ICZN Code.

'''''Saint Martin de Porres''''' is an artwork by [[United States|American]] artist and [[Catholic priest]] [[Thomas McGlynn|Father Thomas McGlynn]]. This sculpture, one of McGlynn's most well known works and is found in the collection of [[Providence College]] in [[Rhode Island]], [[Old Lady of Perpetual Help Church (Washington, D.C.)|Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], among others. It is a statue of [[Saint Martin de Porres]].&lt;ref name="SOS1993"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=St. Martin Fountain, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!319554~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS1994"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1994 | title=Saint Martin de Porres, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323793~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The sculpture is a standing figure of Saint Martin de Porres wearing a [[cassock]] with a belt at the waist, he wears shoes. His head looks downwards, eyes somewhat closed, as if in deep thought or prayer. In his proper right hand he holds a [[Christian cross|cross]] to his chest and his proper left hand grips his leg with a broom under his arm.&lt;ref name="SOS1994"/&gt; Some of the works of this piece feature the Saint looking down at [[rat]]s that have gathered at his feet, often featuring 2-3 rats.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt;

==Father Thomas McGlynn==

McGlynn was born May 23, 1906 to [[Frank McGlynn, Sr.|Frank McGlynn]] and Rose O'Beirne. On September 8, 1925 he received the habit of the [[Dominican Order]], taking the name Brother Matthew. At Dominic's Church in Washington, D.C., he was [[ordained]] a priest on May 20, 1932 by [[Michael Joseph Curley|Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley]]. Receiving his degree in sculpture in [[Rome, Italy]] in 1934 and returned to the United States to study at [[Cranbrook Educational Community]] studying under [[Carl Milles]]. After apostolic ministry and serving as faculty member at Providence College (1937–1938 and 1946), he went to [[Pietrasanta, Italy]] in 1956 commissioned to create a sculpture of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] and he remained in the country until his death on September 3, 1977.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=Saint Martin de Porres, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!319555~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGlynn"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fr.

==Inspiration and Creation==

Growing up, McGlynn was unaware of racial issues during his youth, using discriminatory terms as part of everyday life to describe [[African Americans]]. Upon entering the priesthood McGlynn states that "My meeting with Martin de Porres changed all that."&lt;ref name="Homily"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fr. Pius Pietrzyk, O.P. | year=2010 | title=Fr.

==Locations==
Four versions of the sculpture exist, and the creation of this work is often credited with contributing to the [[canonization]] of the Saint in 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2009 | title=Selected Works of Thomas McGlynn | work=Thomas McGlynn | publisher=Providence College | url=http://www.domcentral.org/library/McGlynn/mcg09.htm | accessdate=12 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229191514/http://www.domcentral.org/library/McGlynn/mcg09.htm | archivedate=29 December 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominican House of Studies==

The original [[plaster]] version of the sculpture resided in the collection of the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C. as of 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt;

===Vatican===

The first, small version of the sculpture was created for use at the Vatican, completed in 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt;

===Providence College===

Providence College has two copies of the sculpture, one in front of Martin Hall and a second at the McGlynn Sculpture Court, named after the sculptor. The Martin Hall sculpture, the fourth in the series, has no rats at the Saints feet, is made of [[bronze]] (H. 7&amp;nbsp;ft.) and was copyrighted in 1958 and dedicated on November 3, 1979.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt; This version was originally designed for [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|Saint Raymond's Cemetery]] in the Bronx, New York City, and McGlynn decided to remove the rats believing that people would have an aversion to them being on a sculpture in a cemetery.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt; It was surveyed in 1993 by the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program and was described as needing treatment.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt;  

The second sculpture, at McGlynn Sculpture Court, features several small rats at the Saints feet. This is an earlier version of the above piece, made also of bronze (H. 48 in. × W. 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 3 in.), created in 1962, cast in 1963 and dedicated on October 2, 1993. The sculpture stands in a small fountain. as part of the Sculpture Court which was built after the [[Dominican Province of St. Joseph]] donated their McGlynn Archives &amp; Sculpture Collection to the College in 1980. This sculpture was described as well maintained by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey program.&lt;ref name="SOS1993"/&gt;

==Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church==

This version of the sculpture is made of [[wood]] (H. 12{{frac|1|2}} ft.) and does not feature the rats at his feet. It was dedicated on May 27, 1989 with the support of the St. Martin de Porres Guild and the founding pastor who wanted the church to be dedicated in the Saints honor. The funds for the work were provided by an endowment supplied by parishioner Mary A. Cooke, who hoped to have the statue erected inside the church school. The piece resides outside. The work was described as needing treatment in 1994 by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey program.&lt;ref name="SOS1994"/&gt;

===Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh===

On November 3, 2009, the parish of St. Joseph in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] was presented a four-foot-tall version of the sculpture by Fr. Ambrose McAlister, Professor Emeritus of Art and Art History at Providence College, to celebrate the Feast of St. Martin de Porres.&lt;ref name="Homily"/&gt; This black marble casting was made from the 1930 version and was created in a Rhode Island-based foundry. It sits upon a table of white [[carrara marble]], which was crafted by parish member Bill Stephany. Fundraising for the work and installation was spearheaded by parish member Daisy Foster. Father McGlynn worked in Raleigh at St. Monica's from 1947 to 1954.&lt;ref name="Raleigh"&gt;{{cite web | author=St. Martin de Porres | year= | title=St. Martin de Porres | work= | publisher=St. Joseph's Catholic Church | url=http://stjosephsraleigh.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=92 | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Martin de Porres Shrine &amp; Institute, Memphis, Tennessee===

The shrine chapel features a small version of the 1930 casting which shares the space with a [[relic]] of St. Martin as well as a stained-glass window and icons created by [[Pam Hassler]].&lt;ref name="Shrine"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Shrine Artwork | work=The Shrine Chapel | publisher=St. Martin de Porres Shrine &amp; Institute | url=http://www.stmartinshrine.org/shrinechapel.html | accessdate=12 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826074913/http://www.stmartinshrine.org/shrinechapel.html | archivedate=26 August 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saved by the Light''''' is a 1995 American biographical television film directed by [[Lewis Teague]] and written by John Mandel.  It stars [[Eric Roberts]] as [[Dannion Brinkley]], a former bully who turns his life around after having a [[near-death experience]].  It is based on Brinkley's [[Saved by the Light|book of the same name]].  It aired on Fox on December 12.

== Plot ==
The movie begins in Aiken, South Carolina in 1975. Dannion Brinkley is a Vietnam veteran who works as a deliveryman in his parents store. A young man with a dark side, he is unfaithful to his loving wife Casey and bullies everyone else around him, even the residents of a retirement home. His mother expresses disgust with him after he beats up a poor man who shoplifted some items from their store. She tells him she thought she raised him with a heart and that his rage is like a terrible sickness. The angry young man's life takes a dramatic turn when he is struck by lightning while talking on the phone . Pronounced dead at the hospital, he miraculously revives and takes an amazing trip to the other side between life and death. A being of light tells him that love makes a difference and shows Dannion the effects that his rage has had on those he hurt from those he bullied on the playground to those he fought in Vietnam. The voice tells him to look at a future without hope and Dannion is shown a collage of images involving natural disasters, famine, poverty and war (footage from the Gulf War is incorporated). The voice tells him this bleak future need not be. The near death experience has a transformative effect on Dannion and he tries to make amends with his parents, wife and the others he has made suffer. He treats the man he had previously beaten up for shoplifting to dinner. Brinkley strikes up a friendship with "near death" expert Doctor Raymond Moody who tries to help him understand his experience. While helping a woman escape her abusive husband, Dannion injures his hand resulting in a catastrophic infection that damages his heart. The doctors tell him it is a matter of life and death but he has no fear of returning. Doctor Moody convinces him he is still needed on earth and Dannion agrees to the operation. He has another near death experience on the table and sees how he has loved and helped others in his new life. He has a beautiful vision of seeing his dead mother reunited in Heaven with her little sister. In the end Brinkley is shown speaking his message to others and admitting that he is a most unlikely messenger.

The '''''Separation of Light from Darkness''''' is, from the perspective of the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] chronology, the first of nine central panels that run along the center of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and which depict scenes from the Book of Genesis. Michelangelo probably completed this panel in the summer of 1512, the last year of the Sistine ceiling project. It is one of five smaller scenes that alternate with four larger scenes that run along the center of the Sistine ceiling. The ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' is based on verses 3–5 from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
 
Although in terms of the Genesis chronology it is the first of nine central panels along the Sistine ceiling, the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' was the last of the nine panels painted by Michelangelo. Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling in two stages. Between May 1508 and the summer of 1511, he completed the "entrance half" of the Sistine chapel and ended this stage by painting the ''Creation of Eve'' and the scenes flanking this central panel. After an idle period of about 6 months, he painted the "altar half," starting with the ''Creation of Adam'', between the winter of 1511 and October 1512.

==Composition==

[[File:First Day of Creation.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Four ''ignudi'' and two shields or medallions surround the image of God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the image of God is framed by four ''ignudi'' and by two shields or medallions. The ''ignudi'' are young, nude males that Michelangelo painted as supporting figures at each corner of the five smaller narrative scenes along the center of the ceiling. There are a total of 20 ''ignudi''. These figures are all different and appear less constrained within their space than the Ancestors of Christ or the Bronze Nudes. In the earliest frescoes painted by Michelangelo toward the entrance of the Sistine chapel, the ''ignudi'' are paired, and their poses are similar but with minor variations. The variations in the poses increase with each set until the poses of the final set of four ''ignudi'' in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' bear no relation to each other.

Although the meaning of these figures has never been completely clear, the Sistine scholar Heinrich Pfeiffer has proposed that the four ''ignudi'' associated with the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' represent day and night, which echo the theme of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Heinrich W. The Sistine Chapel: A New Vision. New York/London, Abbeville Press Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he points out that the ''ignudo'' next to God's right hand (on the side of darkness) is stretching as if awakening from sleep in the morning, that the diagonally opposed ''ignudo'' below God's knee (on the side of light) is carrying a heavy bundle of oak garlands on his shoulders, representing a daytime activity, and that the ''ignudo'' next to God's left arm is falling asleep and signifies nighttime.
Pfeiffer and other scholars have also suggested that in Michelangelo's Sistine iconography the ''ignudi'' represent angels and that the Bronze Nudes below the ''ignudi'' are fallen angels.

[[Image:Michelangelos David.jpg|thumb|right|''Contrapposto'' pose in Michelangelo's ''David''. The shoulders of the figure are seen to angle in one direction, the pelvis in another.]]

Two shields or medallions accompany each set of four ''ignudi'' in the five smaller Genesis panels along the center of the Sistine ceiling. They are often described as painted to resemble bronze. Each is decorated with a picture from either the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha. The subjects of the shields are often violent. In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' the shield above God shows Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac (Genesis 22:9–12), and the one below God shows the prophet Elijah as he is carried up to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11).

At the center of the composition, God is shown in ''[[contrapposto]]'' rising into the sky, with arms outstretched separating the light from the darkness. Michelangelo employed in this fresco the challenging ceiling fresco technique of ''[[sotto in su]]'' ("from below, upward"), which makes a figure appear as if it is rising above the viewer by using foreshortening. The contrapposto pose was also used by Michelangelo in the ''David''. It is reported that Michelangelo painted this fresco in a single ''giornata'', that is, a single working day of approximately eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon, Andrew. Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel. London, England: The Orion Publishing Group Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During Michelangelo's lifetime, this fresco was considered evidence of the painter's technical prowess at its peak. For instance, Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), Michelangelo's student and biographer, wrote in 1550:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Furthermore, to demonstrate the perfection of his art and the greatness of God, Michelangelo depicted God dividing the light from darkness in these scenes, where He is seen in all His majesty as He sustains himself alone with open arms with the demonstration of love and creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. The Lives of the Artists. 1550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historians have noted several unusual features of this fresco. Andrew Graham-Dixon has pointed out that God has exaggerated pectoral muscles suggestive of female breasts, which he interprets as Michelangelo's attempt to illustrate "male strength but also the fecundity of the female principle."&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it has been noted that the anatomy of God's neck is too complex and does not resemble the normal contour of the neck. The lighting scheme of the image has been noted to be inconsistent; whereas the entire scene is illuminated from the bottom left, God's neck appears to have a different light source from the right.

==Anatomical interpretations==

[[Image:Michelangelo neuroanatomy.jpg|thumb|left| Suk and Tamargo proposed that there are three concealed neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the first panel in the Genesis series.]]
[[Image:Michelangelo Sistine Chapel - Ignudo above Libyan Sibyl - restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right| Ignudo facing God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''.]]

Several authors have proposed that Michelangelo concealed anatomical images in this fresco and that these anatomical images account for its unusual features. In an article published in the journal ''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]'' in May 2010, Ian Suk, a medical illustrator, and Rafael Tamargo, a neurosurgeon, both from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], suggested that Michelangelo concealed three neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Suk | first1=Ian |last2=Tamargo|first2=Rafael J.| date=May 2010 |title=Concealed Neuroanatomy in Michelangelo's Separation of Light From Darkness in the Sistine Chapel (abstract) | journal=[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]] |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=851–861 |publisher= |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000368101.34523.E1 |url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/2010/05000/Concealed_Neuroanatomy_in_Michelangelo_s.1.aspx |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/ | title=Michelangelo's secret message in the Sistine Chapel: A juxtaposition of God and the human brain | first=R. Douglas |last=Fields | date=27 May 2010 | work=[[Scientific American]] | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suk and Tamargo explained that Michelangelo started to dissect cadavers at the age of 17–19 years and continued his anatomical studies throughout his life. As a result of his dissections, Michelangelo probably developed a detailed understanding of gross anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. They showed that the anatomical details in God's neck are unlike those of either other necks painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel or of other necks painted by Michelangelo's contemporaries, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello Sanzio (Raphael). The unusual anatomy of God's neck is particularly evident when it is contrasted with the anatomy of the neck of the ignudo facing God in the upper left corner of the panel. The position of the neck of this ignudo is almost identical to that of God's neck, yet the ignudo's neck does not have any of the unusual lines found in God's neck. It is possible that Michelangelo placed these two analogous neck perspectives side by side to emphasize and contrast the hidden image in God's neck.

Suk and Tamargo suggested that Michelangelo concealed a sophisticated image of the undersurface of the brainstem in God's neck and that by following Michelangelo's lines in God's neck, one can outline an anatomically correct image of the brainstem, cerebellum, temporal lobes, and optic chiasm. In addition, they suggested that Michelangelo also included an anterior view of the spinal cord in God's chest and an image of the optic nerves and globes in God's abdomen. They showed how a "shadow analysis" of the unusual lines in God's neck correspond to specific spaces around the brainstem known as the "arachnoid cisterns," which were described in detail much later in 1875 but which Michelangelo inadvertently depicted in God's neck since he was able to render images with almost photographic accuracy. They concluded that "being a painter of genius, a master anatomist, and a deeply religious man, Michelangelo cleverly enhanced his depiction of God in the iconographically critical panels on the Sistine Chapel vault with concealed images of the brain and in this way celebrated not only the glory of God, but also that of His most magnificent creation."

[[File:Michelangelo, Creation of Adam 04.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Meshberger wrote that Michelangelo concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.]]

Of note is that in an article published in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in October 1990, Frank Meshberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Indiana, explained that Michelangelo similarly concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meshberger |first1=Frank Lynn |date=10 October 1990 |title=An Interpretation of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam Based on Neuroanatomy |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume=264 |issue=14 |pages=1837–41 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450140059034 |pmid=2205727 }} [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1229086804171881877 Pdf]. [http://www.mentalhealthandillness.com/creation_fr.html Excerpt] on Mental Health &amp; Illness.com. Retrieved 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Since Michelangelo painted the ''Creation of Adam'' and the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', along with two other Genesis panels, as a single thematic unit between the winter of 1511 and October 1512, it is possible that these four central panels have an underlying anatomical motif. Indeed, Garabed Eknoyan, a nephrologist from [[Baylor College of Medicine]], proposed in an article published in ''[[Kidney International]]'' in March 2000 that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.&lt;ref name="Kidney"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eknoyan | first1=Garabed |date=March 2000 |title=Michelangelo: Art, anatomy, and the kidney |url=http://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538%2815%2946851-6/fulltext |journal=[[Kidney International]] | volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=1190–1201 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00947.x |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo was particularly interested in kidney function because he suffered from kidney stones throughout his adult life and documented this interest in his letters and poems, according to Eknoyan.

[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eknoyan suggested&lt;ref name="Kidney"/&gt; that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.]]

Alternatively, the concealed anatomical image in God's neck in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' has been interpreted as a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland). In an article published in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' in December 2003, Lennart Bondeson and Anne-Greath Bondeson from Malmo University Hospital in Sweden, argued that the abnormality in God's neck is a goiter.&lt;ref&gt;Bondeson, L., and Bondeson, A. G.. Michelangelo's divine goitre. J. R. Soc. Med. 96: 609–611, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has been challenged on the basis that goiters typically occur lower in the neck and, as stated by Suk and Tamargo, that "it is unlikely that Michelangelo, a deeply religious individual, would have defiled the image of God in this important panel by giving God a goiter."

Along these lines, Gilson Barreto and Marcelo G. de Oliveira, in a book published in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Barreto, G., and de Oliveira, M. G.. A Arte Secreta de Michelangelo. Uma Licao de Anatomia na Capela Sistina. Editoria Arx, Sao Paulo, Brasil, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' and noted that God's upper chest and outstretched arms define a "U" shape, which they suggested is reminiscent of the hyoid bone, although they do not offer a thematic explanation for this structure in the fresco.

== History ==
Simple Grapher was released in 2013, it was very simple (that is why named Simple Grapher) and had very simple features (plotting functions and simple inequalities), it also had a very bad GUI. But in few next versions it grow very fast and the program could support lot of features, and in November 2015 the program changed its name to [[Simple Grapher Plus]], because it became very developed program and had a completely new interface.

In November 2015 the program was renamed Simple Grapher Plus, with changes to functionality and interface.

[[File:Roman - Trulla with Duck Head Finial - Walters 572103 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|A complete ''trulla'' in silver]]

The '''Staffordshire Moorlands Pan''', sometimes known as the '''Ilam Pan''', is a 2nd-century AD [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] bronze ''[[trulla]]'' with an [[inscription]] relating to the forts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].  It was found in June 2003 in [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]] parish, Staffordshire, by metal-detectorists, and, in 2005, was bought jointly by the [[Tullie House Museum]] in [[Carlisle]], the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Potteries Museum]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and London's [[British Museum]], with the help of a grant of £112,200 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It is a find of great national and international significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treasurehunting.tv/?p=74  The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan Article and Photos]&lt;/ref&gt;  The pan rotates between a number of locations, including the joint owning museums and another museum on Hadrian's Wall.

==Description==
The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, although lacking its handle and base, is an extremely well preserved enamelled and inscribed bronze (strictly speaking, "copper alloy") vessel for cooking and serving food, decorated in a [[Celtic art|Celtic]] style. (The Celtic peoples of the Roman period made more use of enamel on metal than other parts of the Empire.) It weighs 132.5&amp;nbsp;g, and is 47&amp;nbsp;mm high with a maximum diameter of 94&amp;nbsp;mm, and is 54&amp;nbsp;mm around the outside of the base.&lt;ref&gt;BM collection database"&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration consists of "eight roundels, with eight pairs of intervening hollow-sided triangles. Each roundel encloses a swirling six-armed whirligig centred on a three-petalled device inlaid with red, blue, turquoise and yellow-coloured enamel."&lt;ref&gt;BM collection database"&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that in addition to its functional role it may have been a 'souvenir' of Hadrian's Wall, made for a soldier who had served there. It may have been made as a decorative pan and was then customised by having an inscription added later (using an engraved, rather than relief-cast, inscription as in other enamelled objects of this type).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 2012, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription round the rim is engraved and then filled with enamel. It names forts on the wall: MAIS ([[Bowness-on-Solway]]), COGGABATA ([[Drumburgh]]), VXELODVNVM ([[Stanwix]]), CAMMOGLANNA ([[Camboglanna|Castlesteads]]).  The final part: RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS, is more elusive in meaning, but refers to the wall VALI, and probably a soldier DRACO. AELI may be part of his name, but was also [[Hadrian]]'s family name, so may go with VALI, indicating that the Romans called the wall the "Aelian Wall".

There are other comparable ''trulli'', and two with inscriptions relating to the wall; the inscription means this piece was almost certainly manufactured locally. Judging by these other finds, the handle would have been flat, with enamel decoration on the upper surface.  The [[Rudge Cup]] has a different shape, but also names forts on the wall (see that article for the "Amiens Skillet", another vessel with inscribed fort names).

'''''Stairs 1 Geneva''''' is a film by [[Peter Greenaway]]. It is also a large-scale [[art installation]], an exhibition, a catalogue and a [[Compact Disc|CD]] album.

==The film==

The film comprises one hundred sequences showing a location in the city of [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1994, over a period of one hundred days, one hundred white wooden staircases were installed around the city to be climbed by the public. At the top of each staircase was a simple hole framing a "living picture postcard", a perfect "cinema-image by [[Peter Greenaway]]" accompanied by a commentary of one sentence in French and English, printed below the viewfinder. Greenaway's idea was to create a reflection on location in cinema and to "take films out of the theatres".[http://www.filmfestivalen.se/1994/Stairsone.html]

==The event==

[[Searchlight|Spotlight]]s of different colors were installed throughout the city. The event was called "The Stairs: Geneva The Location", and was expanded into a wider project including other cities and other cinematic themes of relaxation. The events were also published in a catalogue form and a musical compact disc (Merrell, March 1995).

==The installation==

Approximately one hundred performers representing typical regional characters, with costumes and props, ([[John Calvin|Calvin]] and his fellows reformers, different spirits of the lake, [[Laura Ashley]] with her bicycle, living statues, etc.), were sited within the framed view of the staircases' viewfinders. They all were specially trained to perform a choreography (by Serge Campardon[http://www.compagnienomades.com]) every 15 minutes. Each performer was given a luxury Genevan watch to check the time throughout the five or more hours of their performance.

==Further details==

The film's scenes show day or night views in the exact frame defined by the staircase's viewfinder. Superimposed images make some of the characters of the installation appear and disappear in the frame under different lights, and are linked with different kind of local events, such as a cycle race or a children's choir on the cathedral steps. The voice-over patiently helps the visual description by numbering the scenes by the same number of each staircase, and reading the sentence printed on the viewfinder. Each scene is accompanied by a one-minute music pattern by Patrick Mimran,[http://www.mimran.com/]. The soundtrack CD which accompanies the project suggests each piece can be played randomly, just as a visitor could visit the staircases in any order.

An exhibition was also set in the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]][http://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/mahg/musee/mah/mah.html] where lights and slide projections supplemented a display of one hundred sculpted heads found and chosen in the museum depot, as well as one hundred historical helmets.

'''''Symphony: Mathis der Maler''''' (''Matthias the Painter'') is among the most famous orchestral works of German composer [[Paul Hindemith]].  Music from the symphony was incorporated into, or reworked for, Hindemith's opera ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'', which concerns the painter [[Matthias Grünewald]] (or Neithardt).

== History ==
Hindemith composed the symphony in 1934, while plans for the opera were in their preliminary stages. The conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] asked him at that time for a new work to perform on an upcoming [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] concert tour, and Hindemith decided to compose symphonic movements that could serve as instrumental interludes in the opera, or be drawn upon or elaborated into various scenes. Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic gave the first performance on 12 March 1934. The first performance outside Germany was given by the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra in October 1934, conducted by [[Otto Klemperer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=Hindemith Does His Part|journal=The Nation|year=1934|volume=139|pages=487–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performances include the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936, conducted by [[Daniel Sternberg]].

The symphony was well received at its first performances, but Furtwängler faced severe criticism from the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] government for performing the work, given that other Hindemith scores had been denounced by the party as "degenerate" and "Jewish connected." Moreover the opera's plot, which turned on an artist's duty to pursue his vision irrespective of political considerations, was anathema to Nazi ideology.  Hindemith completed the full opera by 1935 but, because of the political climate it could not be staged in Germany, and only in 1938 was it at last premiered, in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.

==Structure==
The symphony has three [[movement (music)|movements]]:

# Engelkonzert (Angelic Concert)
# Grablegung (Entombment)
# Versuchung des heiligen Antonius (The Temptation of Saint Anthony)

which correspond to the opera as follows:

*Overture
*Orchestral interlude from the last act
*Orchestral piece reworked and amplified into a visionary scene in Scene 6 of the Opera

Each movement relates to a tableau painted by Grünewald for the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]], an elaborate construction of panels behind panels, which presents different views as its various levels are unfolded. The Concert of Angels is seen when the outer wings of the altarpiece are opened; the Entombment remains always visible at the base of the altarpiece below the wings; and the [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]]-like Temptation of St. Anthony is uncovered when the inner wings are opened. Grünewald juxtaposed religious serenity with depictions of suffering grounded in the tensions that wracked 16th century Germany during the peasant uprising prompted by the [[Reformation]]. These contrasts are faithfully mirrored in Hindemith's score, which offers at once a portrait of a turbulent historical era and an urgent contemporary statement born amid political strife. 

Hindemith's principle of harmonic fluctuation is readily apparent in this work. For example, the second movement opens on a perfect fifth sonority and gradually introduces more dissonant pitches. The result is an implied tonal center, although in much of his harmony the [[functional tonality]] of tradition plays no governing role.

The '''Symphony No. 3''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 36, also known as the '''''Symphony of Sorrowful Songs''''' ({{lang-pl|Symfonia pieśni żałosnych}}), is a [[symphony]] in three [[movement (music)|movements]] composed by [[Henryk Górecki]] in [[Katowice]], Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] earlier manner and his more [[tonality|tonal]] later style. It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the [[Royan Festival|Royan International Festival]], with [[Stefania Woytowicz]] as soprano and [[Ernest Bour]] as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

A solo [[soprano]] sings Polish texts in each of the three movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/holocaust/goreckilyrics696.html |title=Words in Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 (in translation) |website=Web.ics.purdue.edu |date=1944-09-26 |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]], the second a message written on the wall of a [[Gestapo]] cell during World War II, and the third a [[Silesia]]n folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the [[Silesian uprisings]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis, David. "[http://www.mahlerarchives.net/archives/ellisevocations.pdf Evocations of Mahler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917102253/http://www.mahlerarchives.net/archives/ellisevocations.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}" (PDF). ''Naturlaut'' 4(1): 2–7, 2005. Retrieved 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war.

Until 1992, Górecki was known only to [[connoisseurs]], primarily as one of several composers from the [[Polish School (music)|Polish School]] responsible for the postwar [[Music of Poland#Classical music|Polish music renaissance]].{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} That year, [[Elektra Records#Beginnings|Elektra-Nonesuch]] released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the [[London Sinfonietta]], that topped the classical [[Record chart|charts]] in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=170}}

==Background==
Despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art (often denounced as "[[Formalism (music)|formalist]]" by the [[communism|communist]] authorities), post-war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival in 1956.{{sfn|Thomas|2005|pp=85–6}} Górecki had won recognition among avant-garde composers for the experimental, [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] and [[serialism|serialist]] works of his early career; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as ''Scontri'', which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn, and his First Symphony, which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth Bienniale.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=134}} Throughout the 1960s, he continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].

During the 1970s, Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces ''Euntes ibant et flebant'' (Op. 32, 1972) and ''Amen'' (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic [[minimalist music|minimalism]] and the simplified textures of his more recent work.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, [[tonality]], and [[melody]], and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as [[Arvo Pärt]] and [[John Tavener]], are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term "[[holy minimalism]]," although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.

==Composition==
In 1973, Górecki approached the Polish [[Folklore|folklorist]] Adolf Dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [[Silesia]] region in south-western Poland. Górecki was impressed by the melody "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" (''Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?''), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the [[Silesian Uprising]]s of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son."{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=81}}

[[File:'Palace”, Zakopane, A-406 M 03.jpg|thumb|''The Palace'' in [[Zakopane]]; the former Nazi Gestapo prison was where the composer took an inscription scrawled on a cell wall for the composition of his symphony.]]

Later that year, Górecki learned of an inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in a German [[Gestapo]] prison in the town of [[Zakopane]], which lies at the foot of the [[Tatra mountains]] in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old  [[:fy:Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna|Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna]], a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read ''O Mamo, nie płacz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie'' (Oh Mamma do not cry, no.  Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=82}} He later explained, "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me."{{sfn|Górecki|2003}}

Górecki now had two texts: one from a mother to her son, the other from a daughter to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century [[Folk music|folk song]] from the southern city of [[Opole]].&lt;ref name="McCusker" /&gt; Its text contains a passage in which the [[Virgin Mary]] speaks to her [[Jesus|Son]] dying on the cross: "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother&amp;nbsp;..." (''Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany&amp;nbsp;...''). Górecki said, "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons&amp;nbsp;... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from [[Psalm 94|Psalm 93/94]] in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans.{{' "}}{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=83}} However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent [[lament]]s.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=83}}

==Instrumentation and score==
The symphony is constructed around simple harmonies, set in a neo-[[mode (music)|modal]] style&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, Imre. "[http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=25383 Górecki's Symphony no.3, 'Symphony of Sorrowful Songs'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212621/http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=25383 |date=2007-09-27 }}". ''Le Chercheur de traces''. Retrieved on 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which makes use of the [[medieval music]]al modes, but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition. A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes. Ronald Blum describes the piece as "mournful, like [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], but without the bombast of percussion, horns and choir, just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano".&lt;ref name="Blum" /&gt; The work consists of three [[elegiac]] movements, each marked ''Lento'' to indicate their slow [[Tempo|tempi]].&lt;ref&gt;Han-Leon, Chia. "[http://inkpot.com/classical/goreckisym3.html Symphony No.3, op.36 (1976)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611145606/http://inkpot.com/classical/goreckisym3.html |date=2007-06-11 }}". ''The Flying Inkpot'', 9 December 1999. Retrieved on 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud—the dynamics reach ''[[fortissimo]]'' in only a few bars.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

The symphony is scored for solo [[soprano]], four [[flute]]s (two players doubling on [[piccolo]]s), four [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[contrabassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]] in F, four [[trombone]]s, [[harp]], [[piano]] and [[string section|strings]]. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first [[violin]]s, 16 second violins, 12 [[viola]]s, 12 [[cello]]s, and 8 [[double bass]]es. For most of the score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate [[Staff (music)|staff]]. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for a greater number of parts.

Unusually, the score omits [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]]s, [[bass clarinet]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play only in the first movement, and only for a few bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).

The [[musicologist]] Adrian Thomas notes that the symphony lacks [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] outside of [[musical mode|modal]] inflections (that is, occasional use of pitches that fall outside the mode), and that it does not require nonstandard techniques or [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] playing. Thomas further observes that "there is no second-hand stylistic referencing, although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found, distantly removed, in the music of composers as varied as [[J.S. Bach|Bach]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Piotr Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], and even [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]."{{sfn|Thomas|2005|p=265}}

''CD Times''. Retrieved on 19 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on a late 15th-century [[lament]] of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] from the ''Lysagora Songs'' collection of the Holy Cross Monastery (''Św. Krzyż Monastery'') in the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]]. Comprising three [[Theme (music)|thematic]] sections, the movement opens with a [[canon (music)|canon]] based on a 24-bar theme, which is repeated several times.  The canon begins in 2 parts; then, for each repetition of the theme, an extra part is added, until the canon is in eight parts (with the top two parts doubled at the octave, making for ten voices total), using a 24-bar melody in the [[Aeolian mode]] on E. It begins with the double basses, 2nd part, with each succeeding entry occurring one [[bar (music)|measure]] later (i.e., a new entry begins every 25 measures), each starting a diatonic [[interval (music)|fifth]] above the last.  That means that each appearance of the melody in a new part is in a different mode, in this order:

# [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] on E (double basses, 2nd part)
# [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] on B (double basses, 1st part)
# [[Locrian mode|Locrian]] on F{{music|#}} (cellos, 2nd part)
# [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] on C (cellos, 1st part)
# [[Ionian mode|Ionian]] on G (violas, 2nd part)
# [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] on D (violas, 1st part)
# [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] on A (2nd violins, 2nd part)
# [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] on E (1st violins, 2nd part)

After the 8-part canon is played, it is repeated, with the 1st parts of the 1st and 2nd violins (silent up to this point) doubling the other violin parts an octave higher.

After that, the canon continues, but the voices gradually drop out one by one, from the lowest upwards and the highest downwards; the instruments in question then double, or play the parts of, a higher or lower voice that is still playing, in this order ('→' means 'double/play the parts of'):

# Double basses: 2nd part (low E Aeolian) → 1st part (B Phrygian) [''canon reduced to 7 voices'']
# 1st violins: 1st part (highest E Aeolian) → 2nd part (high E Aeolian)
# Double basses (B Phrygian) → Cellos, 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian)
# Cellos: 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian) → 1st part (C Lydian) [''canon reduced to 6 voices'']
# 2nd violins: 1st part (high A Dorian) → 2nd part (A Dorian)
# Double basses (F{{music|#}} Locrian) → Cellos (C Lydian)
# Cellos (C Lydian) → Violas, 2nd part (G Ionian)
# 2nd violins (A Dorian) → Violas, 1st part (D Mixolydian)
# 1st violins (high E Aeolian) → 2nd violins (A Dorian) [''canon reduced to 4 voices'']
# Double basses fall silent
# 1st violins (A Dorian) → 2nd violins + violas, 1st part (D Mixolydian) [''canon reduced to 2 voices'']

The canon ends, with all the strings (except the double basses) ending on a single note, E4.

The soprano enters on the same note in the second section and builds to a climax on the final word, at which point the strings enter forcefully with the climax of the opening canon. The third section of the movement (''Lento—Cantabile semplice'') is a long ''[[dénouement]]'', another canon based on the same melody in the opening canon; but this time it starts with 8 parts (the top two doubled in octaves), and the voices drop out from high to low:

# 1st violins: 1st part (highest E Aeolian) → 2nd part (high E Aeolian)
# 2nd violins: 1st part (high A Dorian) → 2nd part (A Dorian)
# 1st violins sustain an E5 drone
# 2nd violins sustain an E4 drone as 1st violins fall silent
# Violas: 1st part (D Mixolydian) → 2nd part (G Ionian)
# Violas sustain an E3 drone as 2nd violins fall silent
# Cellos: 1st part (C Lydian) → 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian)
# Cellos sustain an E2 drone as violas fall silent
# Double Basses: 1st part (B Phrygian) → 2nd part (melody in low E Aeolian)

The movement thus ends with the lower strings, and the piano (briefly recalling the second section of the movement).

The nine-minute second movement is for soprano, clarinets, horns, harp, piano, and strings, and contains a [[libretto]] formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by Blazusiakówna on the cell wall in [[Zakopane]].&lt;ref name="McCusker" /&gt; According to the composer, "I wanted the second movement to be of a highland character, not in the sense of pure folklore, but the climate of [[Podhale]]&amp;nbsp;... I wanted the girl's monologue as if hummed&amp;nbsp;... on the one hand almost unreal, on the other towering over the orchestra."{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=91}}

The movement opens with a folk [[drone (music)|drone]], A–E, and a melodic fragment, E–G{{music|sharp}}–F{{music|sharp}}, which alternate with sudden plunges to a low B{{music|flat}}–D{{music|flat}} [[Dyad (music)|dyad]]. Thomas describes the effect as "almost cinematic&amp;nbsp;... suggest[ing] the bright open air of the mountains".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=91}} As the soprano begins to sing, her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A{{music|flat}}. The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]] for nearly one and a half minutes. The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish [[Ave Maria]], sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano.

The tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two, and subtle changes in dynamism and [[Musical mode|mode]] make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear. With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes, it comprises three verses in [[A minor]]&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; and, like the first movement, is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif. The melody is established in the opening verse, and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement. As in the second movement, the motifs are built up from inversions of plain [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[seventh chord]]s stretching across several octaves. As the soprano sings the final words, the key changes to a pure [[diatonic]] [[A major]] which accompanies, in writer David Ellis's words, the "ecstatic final stanza":&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;
{{blockquote|O sing for him / God's little song-birds / Since his mother cannot find him.&lt;br&gt;
And you, God's little flowers / May you blossom all around / that my son may sleep a happy sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Hodges, John. "[http://www.ransomfellowship.org/articledetail.asp?AID=144 A Polish Composer Makes Minimalism Meaningful]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". ''Critique'', 1993. Retrieved on 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The orchestra returns to A minor before a final postlude in A major.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; In Górecki's own words: "Finally there came that unvarying, persistent, obstinate 'walczyk' [on the chord of A], sounding well when played piano, so that all the notes were audible. For the soprano, I used a device characteristic of highland singing: suspending the melody on the third [C{{music|sharp}}] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves stepwise downward [in sixths]".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=82}}

==Interpretation==
[[Image:Fouquet Madonna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Fouquet]], ''Madonna and Child'', c. 1450.]]
The symphony was dedicated to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, "Who was I supposed to dedicate it to?"{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=133}} He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child.  Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=134}} While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to [[Auschwitz]], he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed.&lt;ref name="JPz"/&gt; Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history:

{{quotation|
The symphony alludes to each of the main historical and political developments in Poland's history from the 14th century to 1976, the year of its composition. What is more, each of the three movements appears to represent a different age .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and [they are] chronologically contiguous. The composer seems to have created three separate and discrete "chapters" in his summary of Poland's history.{{sfn|Howard|2007|pp=215–6}}
}}

Górecki said of the work, "Many of my family died in concentration camps. I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. You know how it is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a ''[[Dies Irae]]''; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs."{{sfn|Jacobson|1995|p=191}}

==Critical and cultural reception==
Górecki's Symphony No. 3 was written in 1976, when Górecki was, in the words of the music critic Jane Perlez, "a fiery figure, fashionable only among a small circle of modern-music aficionados".&lt;ref name="JPz"&gt;Perlez, Jane (27 February 1994). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E6DF153BF934A15751C0A962958260 "Henryk Górecki"]. ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''. Retrieved 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival, [[Ernest Bour]] conducting, was reviewed by six western critics, all of them harshly dismissive.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} Heinz Koch, writing for ''Musica'', said that the symphony "drags through three old folk melodies (and nothing else) for an endless 55 minutes".&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Heinz. "Mit wichtigen bundesdeutschen Beiträgen". Musica 31, no. 4. 1977. p 332. ''Da schleift einer drei alte Volksliedmelodien (und sonst nichts) 55 endlose Minuten lang.''&lt;/ref&gt; Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a "prominent French musician" (Górecki did not name names, though it was probably [[Pierre Boulez]]), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed "[[Feces|Merde]]!"{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=216}}

The symphony was first recorded in Poland in 1978 by the soprano [[Stefania Woytowicz]].{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} It was deemed a masterpiece by Polish critics,{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=217}} although, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, recordings and performances of the work were widely criticised by the press outside Poland.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} The symphony drew hostility from critics who felt that Górecki had moved too far away from the established avant-garde style and was, according to Dietmar Polaczek (writing for ''Österreichische Musikzeitschrift''), "simply adding to the decadent trash that encircled the true pinnacles of avant-gardism".&lt;ref&gt;Polaczek, Dietmar. "Neue Musik in Royan", ''Österreichische Musikzeitschrift'', July–August, 1977. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gallen Kallela Lemminkainens Mother.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''Lemminkäinen's Mother'' (1897) by [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] is an earlier evocation of the themes of motherhood and war explored in Górecki's Third Symphony. This work depicts a scene from the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A warrior named Lemminkäinen had been murdered, cut into pieces and thrown to the river at [[Tuonela]]. His mother went to the river of God Tuoni, found the corpse of her dead son and brought him back to life.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1985, the French filmmaker [[Maurice Pialat]] featured a section of the third movement in the ending credits of his movie ''[[Police (1985 film)|Police]]''. When the work was later repackaged as a "[[soundtrack album]]", it sold well. Although Gorecki's name was featured prominently on the front cover, the [[sleeve notes]] on the back provided precious little information about the work,{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=137}} and Górecki's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicki, James. "[http://pages.sbcglobal.net/jameswierzbicki/gorecki.htm Henryk Górecki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814012656/http://pages.sbcglobal.net/jameswierzbicki/gorecki.htm |date=2009-08-14 }}". ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', July 7, 1991. Retrieved 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, British [[industrial music]] group [[Test Dept]] used the symphony as a backdrop for video [[collage]]s during their concerts, recasting the symphony as a vehicle for the band's sympathy with the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement,{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=138}} which Górecki also supported (his 1981 piece ''[[Miserere (Górecki)|Miserere]]'' was composed in part as a response to government opposition of Solidarity trade unions).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Adrian. "Górecki, Henryk Mikolaj". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie. (London): Macmillan, 2001, v.10, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1980s, the symphony received increasing airplay on US and British classical radio stations, notably [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]. The fall of communism helped to spread the popularity of Polish music generally, and by 1990 the symphony was being performed in major cities such as New York, London and Sydney.&lt;ref name="JPz"/&gt; A 1991 recording with the [[London Sinfonietta]], [[Conducting|conducted]] by [[David Zinman]] and featuring the soloist [[Dawn Upshaw]], was released in 1992 by the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] imprint [[Nonesuch Records]]. Within two years, the recording had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide;&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;Blum, Ronald. "The Impact of Górecki's Symphony No. 3". ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 26 June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; the recording climbed to number 6 on the mainstream UK album charts,{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=144}} and while it did not appear on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it stayed at the top of the US classical charts for 38 weeks and stayed on for 138 weeks.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=145}} The Zinman/Upshaw recording has sold over a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Top 10 Discs of the Decade |magazine=[[BBC Music Magazine]] | date = 2002-11-01 | pages =27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably counts as the best selling contemporary classical record of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Performing Pain: Music and Trauma in Eastern Europe - Page 134 Maria Cizmic - 2011 soprano Dawn Upshaw, Górecki's Third Symphony encountered a rather incredible period in its reception history: it became the best-selling classical record of all time, even crossing over into the popular music charts in the United Kingdom. [this cannot be correct across all classical categories - see sources for Switched on Bach, Essential Pavarotti etc].&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] described the symphony's success as essentially a phenomenon of the [[compact disc]], and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in ''A guide to the symphony'', wondered whether the commercial success of the work was "a flash in the pan" or would turn out to have lasting significance.{{sfn|Layton|1995|p=401}} In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, "[are people] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?"{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' phenomenon of 1958: "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity."{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. &lt;!--Was that the end of a sentence? I used the required four dots, spaced only to the right; reformat with three dots if there was no period there in the original--&gt;Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed."{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}}

At least a dozen recordings were issued in the wake of the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]'' (1993), and in the soundtrack to [[Julian Schnabel]]'s ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996).{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=152}} An art gallery in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=152}}. On June 24, 2018, in an unprecedented gesture, the host of SiriusXM followed a playing of the Zinman/Upshaw recording by asking the listeners to consider parallels between the theme of the texts referencing the separation of mothers and children to the then current political situation.
