'''''An American Werewolf in London''''' is a 1981 British-American [[Comedy horror|horror comedy film]] written and directed by [[John Landis]] and starring [[David Naughton]], [[Jenny Agutter]], and [[Griffin Dunne]]. The film tells the story of two American students, David and Jack, who are attacked by a [[werewolf]] while on a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking holiday]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name=star&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2016/06/26/rewind-an-american-werewolf-in-london-still-howlingly-good.html "Rewind: An American Werewolf in London still howlingly good"]. ''Toronto Star'', Bruce DeMaraEntertainment Sun., June 26, 2016. Page E4&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on August 21, 1981, the same year as werewolf movies ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' and ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]''. It was a critical and commercial success, winning the 1981 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]. Since its release, it has become a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/american_london.html|title=''An American Werewolf in London'' review|work=Reelviews|year=2000|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loosely connected sequel, ''[[An American Werewolf in Paris]]'', was released by [[Hollywood Pictures]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=star /&gt;

==Plot==
Two American [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]], David Kessler and Jack Goodman, are trekking across the [[Moorland|moors]] in [[West Yorkshire|Yorkshire]]. As darkness falls, they stop for the night at a local pub called the Slaughtered Lamb. Jack notices a [[pentagram|five-pointed star]] on the wall, but when he asks about it, the pubgoers stop talking and become hostile. The pair decide to leave, although the pub landlady insists the others should stop them. Instead, the local pubgoers only warn them to keep to the road, stay clear of the moors and beware of the full moon. David and Jack end up wandering off the road onto the moors, where they hear sinister howls, which seem to be getting closer. Meanwhile, the crowd in the pub show conflict over letting the boys go, but refuse to go after them. They start back to the Slaughtered Lamb but realize that they're now lost. The boys are attacked by a large wolf-like animal, and Jack is killed. The attacker is shot by some of the pubgoers, who have finally come out to search for the boys, but instead of a dead animal, David sees the corpse of a naked man lying next to him. David survives the mauling and is taken to a hospital in [[London]].

When David wakes up three weeks later, he does not remember what happened. He is interviewed by police Inspector Villiers who tells him he and Jack were attacked by an escaped [[lunatic]]. David insists they were actually attacked by a large [[dog]] or [[wolf]]. Jack appears to David as a [[ghost]], and explains they were attacked by a [[werewolf]], and that David is now a werewolf. Jack urges David to kill himself before the next full moon, not only because Jack is cursed to be a ghost for as long as the bloodline of the werewolf that attacked them survives, but also to prevent David from inflicting the same fate on anyone else. Not surprisingly, David does not believe him, thinking that Jack is a [[hallucination]]. Meanwhile, Dr. Hirsch takes a road trip to the Slaughtered Lamb to see if what David has told him is true. When asked about the incident, the pubgoers deny any knowledge of David, Jack, or the attack. However, one distraught pubgoer speaks to Dr. Hirsch outside the pub and says David should not have been taken away, and that everyone else will be in danger when he changes. The man is then cut off by a fellow pubgoer.

Upon his release from intensive care, David moves in with Alex Price, a pretty young nurse who grew infatuated with him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London apartment, where they later have sex for the first time. Jack, in a more advanced stage of decay, appears to David to warn him that he will turn into a werewolf the next day. Jack again advises David to take his own life to avoid killing innocent people, but David still does not believe him and urges him to go away. When the full moon rises David suddenly feels extremely hot, strips off his clothes and painfully transforms into a werewolf. He then begins to prowl the streets and the [[London Underground]], slaughtering six citizens in the process. He wakes up in the morning, naked on the floor of the wolf enclosure at the [[London Zoo]], unharmed by the resident wolves and with no recollection of his activities.

David realizes that Jack's ghost was right about everything and that he himself is responsible for the murders the night before. After failing to get himself arrested in [[Trafalgar Square]], David runs away from Alex. He goes to [[Piccadilly Circus]], calling his family from a phone booth to say he loves them, then loses courage when he attempts to slit his wrists with a pocket knife but fails. David then sees Jack, in a yet more advanced stage of decay, outside an [[adult movie theater]]. Inside, Jack is accompanied by David's victims from the previous night, most of whom are furious with David (although one couple is quite unfazed about it). While his ghost victims suggest various and comical ways for David to kill himself with the least amount of pain, David transforms again and goes on another killing spree. After bursting out of the cinema and biting off Inspector Villiers' head in the process, David wreaks havoc in the streets, causing various vehicular accidents and deaths. He is ultimately cornered in an alley by the police. Alex runs down the alleyway in an attempt to calm David down by telling him she loves him. Although the wolf-David is apparently placated for a moment, he is shot and killed when he lunges forward, and then returns to human form in front of a grieving Alex.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:An American Werewolf in Londonhorror.jpg|thumb|A production still of one of the nightmare sequences in the film.]]
[[John Landis]] came up with the story while he worked in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as a production assistant on the film ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (1970). He and a Yugoslav member of the crew were driving in the back of a car on location when they came across a group of [[Romani people|gypsies]]. The gypsies appeared to be performing rituals on a man being buried so that he would not "rise from the grave." This made Landis realize he would never be able to confront the undead and gave him the idea for a film in which a man would go through the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;''An Interview with John Landis'' featurette on the ''American Werewolf in London'' [[DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landis wrote the first draft of ''An American Werewolf in London'' in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Two years later, Landis wrote, directed, and starred in his debut film, ''[[Schlock (film)|Schlock]]'', which developed a cult following. Landis developed box-office status in Hollywood through the successful [[comedy film]]s ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' before securing $10 million financing from [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram Pictures]] for his werewolf film. Financiers believed that Landis' script was too frightening to be a comedy and too funny to be a horror film.&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;{{cite book| title=Cult Movies 3| first=Danny| last=Peary| year=1988| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Inc.| location=New York| pages=15–19| isbn=0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the real star of this film is the Oscar-winning transformation effects by [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], which changed the face of horror makeup in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Entertainment"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Entertainment Weekly Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made| year=1996| publisher=Warner Books| location=New York| page=123| isbn=978-0446670289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming took place between February and March 1981 because director John Landis wanted the weather to be bad for atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Roger Cormier"&gt;{{cite article| url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/84739/15-facts-about-american-werewolf-london| title=15 Facts About 'An American Werewolf in London'| author=Roger Cormier| publisher=mentalfloss.com| date=2016-08-19| access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moors were filmed around the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]] in [[Wales]], and East Proctor is in reality the tiny village of [[Erwood|Crickadarn]], about six miles southeast of [[Builth Wells]] off the A470. The Angel of Death statue was a prop added for the film, but the red phone box is real, though the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] road signs were covered by a fake tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=An American Werewolf in London film locations| url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/amwerewolf.html| publisher=The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations| date=9 July 2014| accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pub shown in the film known as the Slaughtered Lamb was actually a cottage located in [[Crickadarn]], and the interior scenes were filmed in the Black Swan, Old Lane, [[Ockham, Surrey#Martyrs Green|Martyrs Green]] in Surrey.&lt;ref name="Pykett2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Pykett|title=British Horror Film Locations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atktMkuOvPwC&amp;pg=PA12|date=2 July 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5193-7|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An American Werewolf in London'' was the first film allowed to shoot in [[Piccadilly Circus]] in 15 years. Landis accomplished this by inviting 300 members of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] to a screening of his then-newly released film [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].&lt;ref name="Roger Cormier"/&gt; The police were so impressed by his work that they granted the production a two-night filming permit between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m. Traffic was stopped only three times for two-minute increments to film the automobile stunts involving the [[double-decker bus]].&lt;ref name="Roger Cormier"/&gt;

==Music==
The film's ironically upbeat soundtrack consists of songs which refer to the moon. [[Bobby Vinton]]'s slow, soothing version of "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]" plays during the opening credits, [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Moondance (Van Morrison song)|Moondance]]" plays as David and Alex make love for the first time, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]" plays as David nears the moment of changing to the werewolf, a soft, bittersweet ballad version of "Blue Moon" by [[Sam Cooke]] plays during the agonizing wolf transformation, and [[the Marcels]]' [[doo-wop]] version of "Blue Moon" plays over the end credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Steven |title=The Essential Monster Movie Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Billboard Book |isbn=978-0-8230-7936-0 |author2=Forrest J. Ackerman |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was composed and conducted by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and recorded at [[Olympic Studios]] in London, engineered by Keith Grant. Bernstein's score can be heard during David's nightmares, when Dr. Hirsch drives through the moors to East Proctor, and when Alex confronts David in the alley. Though Bernstein wrote and recorded music to accompany the transformation scene, the director chose not to use it. The three-minute passage was eventually released by Bernstein under the title "Metamorphosis".&lt;ref&gt;Hollywood and All That,"[https://hollywoodandallthat.com/2013/12/14/the-mystery-of-the-missing-music-cue-or-how-an-american-werewolf-in-london-lost-its-bite/ The mystery of the missing music cue or how an American werewolf in London lost its bite]", December 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
The budget of ''An American Werewolf in London'' was reportedly $10 million. The US box office totaled $30,565,292.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=americanwerewolfinlondon.htm |title=An American Werewolf in London (1981) |publisher= IMDB |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval score of 88% and an average rating of 7.8/10 based on reviews from 49 critics. The critical consensus states: "Terrifying and funny in almost equal measure, John Landis' horror-comedy crosses genres while introducing Rick Baker's astounding make-up effects."&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_werewolf_in_london/ |title=An American Werewolf in London |publisher=[[Flixster]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 60 out of 100 rating based on six reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/an-american-werewolf-in-london | title=An American Werewolf in London reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kim Newman of [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] praised the film, saying "carnivorous lunar activities rarely come any more entertaining than this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=119318 |title=Review of An American Werewolf in London |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tom Huddleston from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' also gave the film a positive review, saying the film was "not just gory but actually frightening, not just funny but clever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/an-american-werewolf-in-london-re-release |title=An American Werewolf in London (Re-release) |first=Tom |last=Huddleston |date=October 27, 2009 |journal=''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' |accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Leslie Halliwell|Halliwell's Film Guide]]'' described the film as a "curious but oddly endearing mixture of horror film and spoof, of comedy and shock, with everything grist to its mill including tourist Britain and the wedding of Prince Charles. The special effects are notable and signalled new developments in this field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Halliwell's Film and Video Guide| edition=13th| isbn=0-00-638868-X| last=Halliwell| first=Leslie| publisher=Harper Collins| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]]'s review was less favourable; he stated that "''An American Werewolf in London'' seems curiously unfinished, as if director John Landis spent all his energy on spectacular set pieces and then didn't want to bother with things like transitions, character development or an ending."&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite news |date=January 1, 1981 | author=Roger Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/40318071/1023 |title=An American Werewolf in London |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daily Telegraph|''Daily Telegraph'']] stated that it was "the first mainstream hit which managed to make its gross-out effects simultaneously shocking and hilarious" and called the signature werewolf transformation scene "stunningly ingenious, without a computer effect in sight, but also suffused with squirm-inducing agony."&lt;ref name="Tim Robey"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/21/an-american-werewolf-in-london-how-john-landis-and-rick-baker-tr/| title=An American Werewolf in London: How John Landis and Rick Baker transformed horror| author=Tim Robey| publisher=The Daily Telegraph| date=2016-08-21| access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Telegraph'' also cited the slew of 80's genre films which came after ''An American Werewolf in London'', such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Gremlins]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead 2]]'', which followed the film's example of blending visceral horror effects with comedy.&lt;ref name="Tim Robey"/&gt;  Director [[Edgar Wright]] (''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'') cited the movie as a major inspiration for his own film-making and a milestone in the genre.&lt;ref name="Tim Robey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmfTfFWAKxY| title=Edgar Wright on An American Werewolf in London Part 1| author=Horror Channel Frightfest| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2009-07-09| access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low budget independent movie ''The Snarling'' (2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Raybould|first=Pablo|title=The Snarling|date=2018|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263780/|others=Laurence Saunders, Chris Simmons, Ben Manning|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was heavily inspired by Landis's film and contains various motifs and references including a cameo by [[Albert Moses]] paying direct tribute to his role in the film.

[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] magazine, reviewing the film in 2000, thought that the blending of comedic and horror elements "don't always sit well side-by-side," but called the transformation scene "undoubtedly a classic" because of its' "good old-fashioned makeup and trickery making the incredible seem real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/empire-essay-american-werewolf-london/review/| title=EMPIRE ESSAY: An American Werewolf in London review| author=Pat Reid| publisher=Empire magazine| date=2000-01-01| access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] magazine's Joshua Rothkopf, writing on the 35th anniversary of the film's release, called ''An American Werewolf in London'' an "allegory of exoticized Jewishness".&lt;ref name="Joshua Rothkopf"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/how-american-werewolf-in-london-transformed-horror-comedy-w434829| title=How 'American Werewolf in London' Transformed Horror-Comedy| author=Joshua Rothkopf| date=2016-08-19| access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is embodied by the character of David and his growing awareness of his "otherness" as a werewolf alongside his own outsider status as a Jewish American in England. "Hiding a secret deep within one's body, strange urges, xenophobic glances, accusatory feelings of guilt: David's condition already has a name, and this won't be the first film in which Jewish otherness is made monstrous."&lt;ref name="Joshua Rothkopf"/&gt; The article also celebrated the film as an innovative mix of humor and horror: "a landmark in startling makeup effects" and "a riotous piece of fish-out-of-water college humor."&lt;ref name="Joshua Rothkopf"/&gt;

[[Michael Jackson]] was a huge fan of the movie and chose John Landis to direct and Rick Baker to direct makeup effects for his 1983 [[Thriller (song)|''Thriller'']] [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|music video]] based on the strength of their work in ''An American Werewolf in London''. It went on to become one of the most lauded music videos of all time.&lt;ref name="Joshua Rothkopf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Celizic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Celizic |first=Mike |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24282347/ |title='Thriller' still a classic after 25 years - TODAY Entertainment - TODAYshow.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=April 26, 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Director's Regrets===
Director John Landis has expressed regret over changing, and even cutting, certain sequences from the final cut of the film in order to earn an PG-13 rating in the United States. The sex scene between Alex and David was edited to be less explicit, and an extended scene showing the homeless men along the Thames being attacked by the werewolf was eliminated after a test audience reacted negatively to it.&lt;ref name="Roger Cormier"/&gt; Another showed the undead Jack eating a piece of toast which falls out of his torn throat. Landis also concluded that the werewolf transformation scene should have been shorter—he was so fascinated by the quality of Rick Baker's effects that he spent more time on the scene than he otherwise would have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-story-behind-an-american-werewolf-in-london/| title=The Story Behind An American Werewolf in London| author=James White| publisher=gamesradar.com| date=2009-09-23| access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
The film was followed by a [[sequel]] 16 years later, ''[[An American Werewolf in Paris]]'' (1997), which featured a completely different cast and crew, and was distributed by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[Hollywood Pictures]]. According to ''Paris'', David impregnated Alex during their sex scene and soon after the events of ''London'', Alex gave birth to Serafine, a main character in the sequel. This is directly stated in a deleted scene of ''Paris'' and also suggests that the werewolf who bit David was a survivor of the same society of which the antagonists are a part.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Radio adaptation===
A radio adaptation of the film was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]] in 1997, written and directed by [[Dirk Maggs]] and with Jenny Agutter, Brian Glover and John Woodvine reprising the roles of Alex Price, the chess player (now named George Hackett, and with a more significant role as East Proctor's special constable) and Dr. Hirsch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Werewolf-London-Radio-Collection/dp/0563381035 Amazon.co.uk. Retrieved 2016-09-12]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of David and Jack were played by Eric Meyers and [[William Dufris]]. Maggs's script added a back-story that some people in East Proctor are settlers from [[Eastern Europe]] and brought lycanthropy with them.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The werewolf who bites David is revealed to be related to Hackett, and has escaped from an asylum where he is held under the name "[[Larry Talbot]]", the name of the title character in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Halloween Horror Nights===
On August 15, 2013, the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] announced it would use the film as the basis for its seventh maze during that year's annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] event.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The maze was so popular, it became part of the 2014 Halloween Horror Nights event at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} On August 26, 2015, Universal Orlando announced the return of the maze for their 25th annual Halloween Horror Nights event after its popularity at both parks in previous years.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Remake===
In June 2009, it was announced that [[Dimension Films]] was working with producers Sean and Bryan Furst on a remake of the film. This has since been delayed due to other commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McNary |first=Dave |url= https://variety.com/2009/film/news/werewolf-remake-in-development-1118005523/ |title='Werewolf' remake in development |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 29, 2009 |accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, several reports suggested that [[Max Landis]] (son of director John Landis) was considering remaking the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slashfilm.com/an-american-werewolf-in-london-remake/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/american-werewolf-london-remake-max-landis/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the website ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Max Landis would write and direct a remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan |last=Evans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/08/an-american-werewolf-in-london-remake-max-landis |title=An American Werewolf in London to be remade by original director's son |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 November 2016 |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Max Landis confirmed via his Twitter that he had completed the first draft of the script.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Home media==
The film was first released in 1981 on VHS and Betamax under the MCA Videocassette Inc. label and on [[LaserDisc]] and [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] under the MCA Videodisc label. In 1984, MCA Home Video released it on LaserDisc. This would be the last time Universal would release the movie on home video for 17 years. The following year, [[Vestron Video]] acquired the video rights from [[MCA/Universal]] and released it on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in 1985. It was released again on LaserDisc in 1989 (under [[Image Entertainment]] through Vestron) and 1995 (under [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]]), and again on VHS in 1990 under the [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Video Treasures]] label and 1991 and 1994 from Vestron Video (through LIVE Home Video).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The film was first released on [[DVD]] in December 1997 by [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]] according to a LIVE DVD Advertisement. It was presented in a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer and contained the film's theatrical teaser trailer. [[Universal Studios|Universal]] would eventually get the video rights back and released a 20th-anniversary "Collector's Edition" DVD on September 18, 2001, making it the first time Universal released the film on home video since 1984. It included an audio commentary with actors David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, interviews with John Landis and Rick Baker, a 1981 promotional featurette, silent outtakes, storyboards and production photographs. A coinciding VHS was released on the same day. The high-definition version of the film was first released on [[HD DVD]] by Universal on November 28, 2006. A high-definition [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] and 2-disc standard-definition [[DVD region code|Region 1 DVD]] release of the film titled ''An American Werewolf in London – Full Moon Edition'' was released by Universal on September 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd-report.com/2009/07/13/an-american-werewolf-in-london-coming-to-blu-ray/#more-1727|title=An American Werewolf in London coming to Blu-ray|publisher=HD Report|date=July 13, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Region 2 DVDs and Blu-ray were released on September 28 and are known as ''An American Werewolf in London – Special Edition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002JIMY7S |title=An American Werewolf In London - Special Edition DVD 1981: Amazon.co.uk: David Naughton, Don McKillop, Frank Oz, Linzi Drew, Jenny Agutter, Griffin Dunne, John Woodvine, Brian Glover, Rik Mayall, David Schofield, Lila Kaye, Paul Kernber, John Landis: DVD |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; No DVD or Blu-ray version at present contains the film's original mono audio track.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Region 2 DVD release does not include a scene that is fully intact on the Region 1 release and all previous Region 1 and 2 releases. The scene takes place near the end of the film where the character of David calls his parents from a public telephone box. All but the end of this scene had been cut from the Region 2 release because the distributors felt that use of a public phone box, as opposed to a mobile phone, would date the film.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

As of October 2009, Universal said that they were scrapping all existing faulty stock and issuing replacement DVDs. All Blu-ray releases, however, are intact.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2016, Universal re-released the film on Blu-ray as ''An American Werewolf in London – Restored Edition'' to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/An-American-Werewolf-in-London-Blu-ray/160245/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''And the Sea Will Tell''''' is a [[true crime]] book by [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]]. The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on [[Palmyra Atoll]]; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane ("Buck") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and [[Leonard Weinglass]] defended. The book went to No. 1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook.

==The killings==
In 1974, a yachting couple from [[San Diego, California]],  Malcolm "Mac" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne "Muff" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot [[ketch]] to [[Palmyra Atoll]]&amp;nbsp;— 1,200 miles south of Honolulu&amp;nbsp;— hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed.

Also on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as "Jennifer Jenkins" in the book), who had sailed there together from [[Hawaii]] on Stearns' sailing vessel ''Iola'', a deteriorating, patched-together wooden [[sloop]] that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the ''Sea Wind'', was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a [[lathe]] and [[acetylene]] [[welding]] [[torch]].

Walker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on Palmyra to support himself.  The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely.  The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety ''Iola'', against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning ([[Tabuaeran]]), a nearby atoll in [[Kiribati]], to restock&amp;nbsp;— a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine.

According to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' [[Zodiac Nautic|Zodiac]] rigid inflatable [[dinghy]] upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the ''Iola'' and sailed for Hawaii on the ''Sea Wind''. Once in Hawaii, the couple had the ''Sea Wind'' repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive ''Sea Wind'' despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the ''Sea Wind'',&lt;ref name="San Diego Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Diane|title=1974 murder victim still awaits burial|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/people/sdut-murder-trial-bugliosi-graham-sailboat-palmyra-fbi-2014apr18-story.html|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the "400 row" of the [[Ala Wai Harbor]].  It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the [[The Ilikai|Ilikai Hotel]].

Early one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container.

==Trial and punishment==
Buck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Victorville]], in California.  Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the ''Sea Wind'' to Hawaii with the ''Iola'' in tow, but the ''Iola'' ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned.  During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large [[swordfish]] damaged the ''Sea Wind''{{'}}s hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming.

Stephanie Stearns was tried separately in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

==Aftermath==
The book was adapted into the 1991 [[television film]] ''And the Sea Will Tell'', directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]] which aired on [[CBS]] As a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.)

The trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0199342520|title=A Guide to Oral History and the Law|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a [[stroke]] on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="Willits News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Linda|title=Notorious atoll murderer dies after parole to Willits area|url=http://www.willitsnews.com/article/zz/20100609/NEWS/100607291|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=Willits News|date=9 June 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in [[Willits, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/Jun/02/ln/hawaii6020337.html | title = 'Buck' Walker infamous for high-profile Palmyra deaths | author = Mary Vorsino | publisher = HonoluluAdvertiser.com | date = June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker (writing as Wesley G. Walker), claimed in a book about that case that he had been seduced by Mrs. Graham and, in the midst of lovemaking, had been caught by Mr. Graham, who shot his wife and attempted to shoot Walker.

Malcolm Graham's body has never been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Rod|title=Isle murderer Buck Duane Walker up for parole|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/07/13/news/story04.html|work=Honolulu Star Bulletin|date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arts Educational Schools, London''', commonly known as '''ArtsEd''' is an independent [[performing arts]] school based in [[Chiswick]] in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]].

==Overview==
ArtsEd provides specialist vocational training at secondary, further and higher education level in [[musical theatre]] and [[acting]] for [[film]] and [[television]]. The school also offers part-time and holiday courses in the performing arts. The school is accredited by [[Drama UK]] and it offers Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recognised qualifications validated by the [[City University London]] or [[Trinity College, London]].

In 2013 ArtsEd was awarded a grant by the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation]] to fund a refurbishment project. The money was spent on the main theatre, costume storage, the School of Film and Television and the school's access facilities.

Arts Educational Schools London is accredited by Drama UK and is one of twenty-one specialist performing arts schools approved to offer government-funded [[Dance and Drama Awards]], a scheme established to subsidise the cost of professional dance and drama training for the most talented students at leading institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_066987|title=Grants and bursaries for adult learners|publisher=|access-date=6 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204003441/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_066987|archive-date=4 February 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_10023485 Gov.uk: Dance and Drama 10023485] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716054443/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DanceandDrama/DG_10023485 |date=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the School was rated "Outstanding" by Ofsted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/50527|title=Find an inspection report and registered childcare|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|date=14 December 2017|website=reports.ofsted.gov.uk|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625145130/http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/50527|archive-date=25 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

ArtsEd originated from two schools: one founded in 1919 by Grace Cone, the other in 1922 by Olive Ripman. Both offered curriculae combining a general academic education with training in dance, drama, music and art, in preparation for professional careers in or connected with the theatre. In 1939 the two schools amalgamated to form the Cone Ripman School, later named the Arts Educational Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://artsed.co.uk/site/information/About-Us |title=About Us |accessdate=24 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813054003/https://artsed.co.uk/site/information/About-Us |archive-date=13 August 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was first based at Stratford Place in London, but following the outbreak of [[World War II]], relocated to [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]], sharing premises with [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild Bank]] at [[Tring Park]].

In 1941, the school reopened at Stratford Place, while the second school continued to operate in Tring. In 1947, both schools were renamed the Arts Educational Schools. The London school was later based at Golden Lane House in the Barbican until 1986 when the school purchased the former buildings of Acton and Chiswick Polytechnic. This building is now known as Cone Ripman House.

In the 2000s the two schools became independent of each other, and the Tring school has been renamed [[Tring Park School for the Performing Arts]]. Today, Arts Educational Schools London is a co–educational Independent Day School and Sixth Form for pupils aged 11–18, and a professional [[conservatoire]] specialising in acting and musical theatre, as well as a range of part-time courses.

For many years, the president of the school was [[prima ballerina assoluta]] [[Dame Alicia Markova]] and [[Dame Beryl Grey]] became Director in the 1960s. Dame Alicia was succeeded in 2007 by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. Iain Reid was dean of the schools from 1999 until his retirement in December 2006. He was succeeded by John Baraldi, former chief executive of Riverside Studios,and former director of the East 15 Acting School; Baraldi left the school in early 2009, and was succeeded by Jane Harrison. The current dean is Chris Hocking.

'''''Bakwa''''' is an online magazine of literary and cultural criticism based in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]], that covers international cultural issues and has a penchant for fiction and creative non-fiction by Cameroonian writers. Notable contributors include: [[Imbolo Mbue]], [[Ntone Edjabe]], [[Anna Jäger]], [[Kangsen Feka Wakai]], [[Jeremy Klemin]], [[Serubiri Moses]], [[Minna Salami]], [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]], [[Emmanuel Iduma]], [[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]] and [[Johnnie MacViban]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bakwa official website|title=About|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://bakwamagazine.com/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]]|title=Made in Africa III: The rise of African literary digital platforms|work=[[This Is Africa]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://thisisafrica.me/lifestyle/made-in-africa-iii-the-rise-of-african-literary-digital-platforms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bakwa'' has been described as "an eclectic, intelligent take on the dynamic cultural scenes often missed by mainstream, western media".&lt;ref&gt;Dele Maiji Fatunla, [http://whatsonafrica.org/three-african-and-african-diasporan-literary-magazines-that-everyone-should-know/ "Three African and African Diasporan Literary Magazines the Everyone Should Know"], What's On Africa, Royal African Society, 30 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded during the last quarter of 2011 (but operational as from 2012) by [[Dzekashu MacViban]], ''Bakwa'' rose out of the need to fill the lacuna created by the absence of literary and cultural magazines in Cameroon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Guardian Africa Network]]|title=Introducing the Guardian Africa network's new partners|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=2 July 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/introducing-guardian-africa-network-new-partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the defunct ''Pala Pala'' magazine, and it highlights a new dynamic Africa, often ignored by Western traditional media.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Over the years, ''Bakwa'' has been able to establish alliances with important publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Guardian Africa Network),  ''[[Chimurenga magazine]]'', ''[[Kwani?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lindsay|title=Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi Wins the Kwani?

== Notable projects==
For its third issue, in 2012, ''Bakwa'' collaborated with The Ofi Press, an online literary magazine based in Mexico and edited by [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]]. The Ofi Press published a special West African edition, with content in English and Spanish, which focused on West Africa, while ''Bakwa'', in turn, published a special Mexican issue, focusing on Mexican art, culture and society, with most of the content in English and some Spanish translations. The project was lauded by several journals and outlets, especially the online website Heritage 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Heritage 1960]]|title=The Ofi Press: Inside "THE WEST AFRICA EDITION" (Issue #24)|date=2013|accessdate=5 July 2015|url=http://heritage1960.tumblr.com/post/38962666585/the-ofi-press-inside-the-west-africa-edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Bakwa'' was part of #100DaysofAfricanReads, a social media project curated by [[Angela Wachuka]], Executive Director of ''[[Kwani?]]'', which entailed "a series of portraits on books, writers and readers, over a 100 day period ... highlighting the work of an African author in print and online".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bookshy|title=African Reads: 100 Days of Appreciation|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=6 July 2015|url=http://bookshybooks.blogspot.com/2015/02/african-reads-100-days-of-appreciation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of an excerpt from [[Awes Osman]]’s novel, ''[[Skinless Goat in Somalia]]'', Bakwa’s contribution to the project was made up of excerpts and stories from female Cameroonian writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In the same year, in response to ''[[The Simpsons]]''’ episode "[[The Princess Guide]]", ''Bakwa'' did a two-part series on The Simpsons, wherein, bloggers, writers, cultural thinkers and academics were asked to comment on "The Princess Guide" episode. Most of the reactions highlighted poor research, one-dimensional characters, the challenge of portraying believable Nigerians, and the episode’s relatable character, [[Princess Kemi]]. This project on ''The Simpsons'' was later chosen by [[Dead Homer Society]], for the "weekend reading" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charlie Sweatpants|title=A Little Weekend Reading|work=Dead Homer Society|date=11 April 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://deadhomersociety.com/2015/04/11/a-little-weekend-reading/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, thanks to a partnership with [[Goethe-Institut Kamerun]] and [[Phoneme Media]], Bakwa launched a one-off short story competition open to Cameroonians under 39 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bakwa Magazine]]|title=Bakwa Magazine Short Story Competition |date=4 May 2016|accessdate=15 August 2016|url=https://bakwamagazine.com/2016/05/04/bakwa-magazine-short-story-competition}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a Literary Exchange Programme in 2017, between Cameroonain and Nigerian writers, in partnership with [[Saraba Magazine]] and the Goethe-Institut in Cameroon and Nigeria.

'''''Basket of Bread''''' (1945) or '''''Basket of Bread-Rather Death Than Shame''''' is a [[painting]] by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. The painting depicts a heel of a loaf bread in a basket, sitting near the edge of a table.  Dalí's use of bread in his paintings is much more than a staple of one's diet.  In this case, to understand Dalí's message, one must look at the [[political]] context at the time of the painting, his progression as an artist, his [[societal]] beliefs and how bread is used in the painting.

==Progression and comparison to ''The Basket of Bread'' (1926)==
Dalí has used bread in many of his paintings, he explains:
:"Bread has always been one of the oldest subjects of [[fetishism]] and obsession in my work, the first and the one to which I have remained the most faithful. I painted the same subject 19 years ago. By making a very careful comparison of the two pictures, everyone can study all the history of painting right there, from the linear charm of [[primitivism]] to [[stereoscopic]] hyper-[[aestheticism]]."&lt;ref name="Descharnes"&gt;{{cite book | title=Salvador Dalí | author=Descharnes, R | publisher=Abrams | page=94 | year=1985 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rg0AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Bread+has+always+been+one+of+the+oldest+subjects%22&amp;dq=%22Bread+has+always+been+one+of+the+oldest+subjects%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b-h3Tau-IIf6sAO--63MBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA | isbn=0-8109-0830-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leith"/&gt;

[[File:TheBasketofBread.jpg|thumb|left| ''[[The Basket of Bread]]'' (1926)]]
At 22, Dalí spent four months on the 1926 painting ''[[The Basket of Bread]]'', of which he explains: "by the power of its density, the fascination of its immobility, creates the [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysmic]] feeling of a situation beyond our ordinary notion of the real.  We are at the borderline of dematerialization of matter by the sole power of the mind."&lt;ref name="Havard"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spanish Eye: Painters and Poets of Spain | author=Havard, R | page=130 | year=2007 | location=Chippenham, Wiltshire, Great Britain | publisher=Antony Rowe | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n27qmpNO_hUC&amp;pg=PA130 | isbn=978-1-85566-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of this article, painted and completed in [[Monterey, California]] in 1945, he described to Luis Romero as "the most [[esoteric]] and the most [[Surrealist]] of anything I have painted to date,"&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Persistence of Memory: A Biography of Dali | author=Etherington-Smith, M | page=300| year=1995 | publisher=First De Capo Press | origyear=1993 (Random House) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soncxLrkYX0C&amp;pg=PA300 | isbn=0-306-80662-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the painting is even more dynamic by having the basket of bread placed on the edge of the table, giving a strong sense of forthcoming "borderline of dematerialization" than the painting of 1926.&lt;ref name="Havard"/&gt;

==Political context==
Dalí writes in the Bignou Gallery of New York catalogue that he painted ''Basket of Bread'' in two months, when "the most staggering and sensational episodes of contemporary history took place" and finished "one day before the end of the war".&lt;ref name="Pine"&gt;{{cite web | title=Breaking Dalinian Bread: On Consuming the Anthropomorphic, Performative, Ferocious, and Eucharistic Loaves of Salvador Dalí | author=Pine, J | issue=14 | work= Aesthetes and Eaters - Food and the Arts | publisher=University of Rochester, NY | accessdate=2014-05-02 | url=http://www.rochester.edu/in_visible_culture/Issue_14/pine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting's subtitle, ''Rather Death than Shame'', takes on special significance during this time period.  The basket is precariously situated on the edge of the uncovered table, against a starkly black backdrop, an omen to its own sacrificial destruction.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]], a well-recorded subject by Dalí, chose death rather than the inevitable shame of capture on April 30, 1945.  In Dalí's essay, "The Conquest of the Irrational" written in 1935, Dalí speaks of a "moral hunger" of the modern age that the [[Germans|German]] people sought relief through Hitler and [[National Socialism]].  Dalí writes that Hitler’s followers were "systematically cretinized by machinism" and "[[ideological]] disorder", to which they "seek in vain to bite into the senile and triumphant softness of the plump, [[atavistic]], tender, [[militaristic]], and territorial back of any Hitlerian nursemaid." Further, this "irrational hunger is placed before a [[cultural]] dining table on which are found only ... cold and insubstantial leftovers." Hitler portrayed as the heel of a loaf of bread, on the edge of a precipice, sums up Dalí's opinion of Hitler and his ultimate demise.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt;   

The painting was also said by Dalí to have been painted the week the [[atomic bombs]] fell on [[Japan]]. "My objective was to arrive at the immobility of the pre-explosive object", Dalí reveals.&lt;ref name="Leith"&gt;{{cite journal | title=How Dali Transformed Dough Into a Surreal Slice of Life | author=Leith, A | journal=The Independent | date=6 October 2002 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/how-dali-transformed-dough-into-a-surreal-slice-of-life-613445.html | accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken in the context of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], "Rather Death than Shame" could also mean that it's better to have died a victim than bear the shame of having dropped the bombs {{cn|date=February 2013}}.

==Marshall Plan==
''Basket of Bread'' was used as [[propaganda]] for the European Recovery Program, better known as the [[Marshall Plan]]&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; from 1947 to 1951.  The Marshall Plan, which earned [[George Marshall|General George C. Marshall]] the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], is credited with rebuilding [[Europe|European]] nations by restoring agricultural and industrial production and thereby restoring food supply and economic [[infrastructure]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Marshall Plan (Public Law 472) | publisher=United States National Archives and Records Administration | location=Washington, DC | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/marshall_plan/ | accessdate=2011-03-09 | postscript=Act of April 3, 1948 [[European Recovery Act]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More information==
In the 1940s, William Nichols, managing editor of ''[[This Week (magazine)|This Week]]'', saw an artist's work in an [[art gallery]]. Finding the piece, a painting of a loaf of bread, one of the most charming paintings he had ever seen he printed it in his magazine giving the artist in question his first [[mass audience]]. ''This Week Magazine'', a [[print syndication|syndicated]] Sunday magazine, at one time had a [[Magazine circulation|circulation]] of 15 million, the biggest in the world.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

The painting resides in [[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Figueres Teatre-Museu Dalí]], containing the broadest range of works of Salvador Dalí (1904–1989), managed by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Figueres Teatre-Musuí | url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_historia.html | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bellagio Declaration''' is a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] formed in 1993, with the aim of reforming [[intellectual property law]]s in order to foster the protection of [[Folklore|folkloric works]], works of [[cultural heritage]], and the biological and ecological [[know-how]] of traditional peoples.

It was from the 1993 Rockefeller Conference "Cultural Agency/Cultural Authority: Politics and Poetics of Intellectual Property in the Post-Colonial Era".

[[File:byzantine chain in silver and green aluminium arp.jpg|thumb|Part of a [[Mail (armour)|chain maille]] [[bracelet]], in Byzantine weave. It uses [[jump rings]] made from [[silver]] plated [[copper]] and from green anodised [[aluminium]].]]

A '''Byzantine chain''' is a [[metal]] [[link chain]] design used in [[jewellery]] that incorporates a rope-like texture and intriguing textural design. The chains are supple and flexible, draping gracefully about the neck. The origin of the name Byzantine is not known.

The chain is a 4 in 1 chain meaning that each link passes through four others. It is a variation on the Box chain whose links point in a constant direction, unlike Byzantine whose links alternate in direction. 

Aspect ratio is found by taking the inner diameter of the jump ring and dividing it by the diameter of the wire used to make the jump ring.  

The pattern has also been called 'Etruscan', 'Birdcage', 'Fool's Dilemma', 'Idiot's Trap', 'Idiot's Delight', and 'Bird's Nest' but Byzantine is the most common name.

[[Image:Cripta di Santa Maria della Sanità.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main crypt below the main altar of the church of Santa Maria della Sanità.]]
The '''Catacombs of Saint [[Gaudiosus of Naples|Gaudiosus]]''' are underground paleo-Christian burial sites (4th-5th century BC), located in the northern area of the city of [[Naples]] (now Stella district).

==History==
The [[catacombs]] were probably occupied on a pre-existing Greek-Roman necropolis in the district known nowadays as [[Rione Sanità]], that was uninhabited at that time. According to tradition, it was the burial site of St Gaudiosus, a bishop arrived in Naples from [[North Africa]], due to a shipwreck.

His burial took place between 451 and 453 and the place, although was already the tomb of another bishop, St Nostriano, became an object of veneration and since then known by St. Gaudosio name.

As said, the entire area of Rione Sanità was uninhabited and almost "forgot" throughout the [[Middle Ages]] also because of the numerous mudslides that, from above the hill of Capodimonte, flocked to the "virgin village" submerging each item they encountered in their path.

The urbanization of Rione Sanità began only around the sixteenth century and, with it, also the catacombs returned to their original burial function. During the seventeenth century, with the construction of the basilica of [[Santa Maria della Sanità, Naples|Santa Maria della Sanità]]  just above the ancient church or chapel of St Gaudioso, the underground cemetery was "modernized" with profound changes in its original structure until the destruction of some of its parts.

After the outbreak of plague in 1656, the vast limestone caves in the valley became a huge open-air graveyard, and in the early 19th-century at the time of [[Joachim Murat]], numerous bones from the "mummification rooms" were moved as well as later to make space for victims of other epidemics, such as cholera of 1836.

Nowadays, only a small portion remains of the original catacombs.

== Description ==
Access to the catacombs is in the [[crypt]], under the raised presbytery of the church of Santa Maria della Sanità. Her depiction is represented in a faint paleochristian fresco detached by a wall of the old church, due to a mud slide.

The icon of the Lady of Health (Santa Maria della Sanità) venerated since the 5th – 6th century, is the most ancient Marian icon in Naples, is now kept in the first right side chapel of the basilica. Many inhabitants of the neighborhood, however, believe that the church is dedicated to [[Vincent Ferrer|St. Vincent Ferrer]], because of the popular devotion to this holy Dominican and of the beautiful wooden statue of him, placed at the left of the altar.

The crypt, once a long corridor catacomb, clearly contains on the vault and on the walls, visible frescoes by [[Bernardino Fera]] representing stories of martyrs. The arcosolium, placed at the entrance, guards the Tomb of San Gaudioso, with a sixth-century mosaic decoration.

In the various cubicles that open along the arms of the catacombs, were located 5th – 6th century frescoes (St. Peter, among others, and San Sossio, deacon of [[Pozzuoli]]) and a mosaic dating before the late 5th century. The tufa sculpture of the dead Christ to the left of the entrance dates back at the end of the 7th century. The 7th century was for the catacombs a new period of use, especially by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friars]]. In this era it was, in fact, still widespread the use of the drainer: stone cavities in which corpse were leaned into a fetal position, to make him lose the fluids.

The Dominican friars thought that the head was the most important part of the body as the seat of thoughts; that’s way, after drying, the heads were preserved, while the rest of the body was amassed in the charnel house.

During this period was also exercised a macabre practice to take the heads of the now dried corpses and lock them in the walls and painting below a body that would give some indication of the profession of the deceased. This type of burial was reserved for the wealthy classes and was later abandoned due to hygienic reasons.

== Curiosities ==
The dead were buried in small openings in the walls, but now only the skulls survived, due to the fact that the surface had been deteriorated by the humidity. Most of that skullcaps are smaller than modern men ones, maybe because of the different nutrition and the healthier way of life.

The Neapolitan actor [[Totò|Antonio De Curtis]], known as Totò, was a native of the Rione Sanità and he was used to frequent its catacombs, where there is a fresco representing the victory of Death. This image has probably inspired Toto’s poem “A’ livella”.

By the late twentieth century, the Dominican cloister adjacent to the Basilica, had become an inn that sponsors visits to the catacombs of San Gaudioso and San Gennaro. To see even the part illuminated not by the lights, during the visit, it is advisable to bring a flashlight.

'''Deaf West Theatre''' Company is a [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood, California]] based cultural institution. It is the first professional resident Sign Language Theatre in the western half of the United States.

Founded in 1989 by [[Bob Hiltermann]] &lt;ref&gt;Bob HIltermann&lt;/ref&gt; and Irene Oppenhiem, it was originally called “Fountain Theatre of the Deaf,” because their main venue was the [[The Fountain Theatre|Fountain Theatre]] located in [[Hollywood]]. During the first year the theater primarily taught workshops for dozens of deaf writers, directors and actors. Among the first attendees were [[Ed Waterstreet]],&lt;ref&gt;Ed Waterstreet&lt;/ref&gt; [[CJ Jones]], [[Anthony Natale]], [[Terrylene Sacchetti]], Richard Kendall and Phyllis French.

In 1990, the theater began to present short plays. Later, due to financial issues, Mr. Hiltermann announced that he was stepping down as the full-time Managing Director. Ed Waterstreet was chosen to take his place due to his experience with the “[[National Theatre of the Deaf|National Theater for the Deaf]],” and he was named the theater’s first Artistic Director. They soon changed the name to “Deaf West Theater,” which was taken from the “Deaf Way Festival” in [[Washington D.C.]], where Bob Hiltermann had been the producer. Their first full-length play was “[[The Gin Game]],” and starred [[Phyllis Frelich]] and Pat Graybill, and Bob Hiltermann starred in their second production, “[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest]].”

In 1992, Hiltermann left the company completely and Ed Waterstreet assumed the managing and artistic duties full-time. The company now has its own art-deco complex in the [[NoHo Arts District, Los Angeles|NoHo Arts District]] of North Hollywood, which includes a 90-seat theatre.

DWT presents adaptations of classics, contemporary and original works. DWT productions are presented in [[American Sign Language]] with simultaneous translation in English.

Deaf West Theatre brought a revival of [[Big River (musical)|Big River]] to the [[American Airlines Theatre]] on Broadway in 2003, as well as [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]] in 2015.

'''Dyke Action Machine!''' or '''DAM!''' is a [[public art]] and [[Activism|activist]] duo made up of [[designer]] [[Carrie Moyer]] and [[photographer]] Sue Schaffner. DAM! gained notoriety in the 1990s for using commercial photography styling with lesbian imagery in public art.

== History ==
Sue Schaffner and Carrie Moyer formed Dyke Action Machine! (DAM!) in 1991 in [[New York City]]. The duo created [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] [[public art]], putting images of lesbians into commercialized styles and settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together with groups like [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]] and Toxic Titties, DAM! resisted [[sexism]] and [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raizada|first=Kristen|date=2007-01-01|title=An Interview with the Guerrilla Girls, Dyke Action Machine (DAM!), and the Toxic Titties|jstor=4317230|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=19|issue=1|pages=39–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAM! specifically targeted [[lesbophobia]], the marginalization of lesbians not only in favor of heterosexuality but also within LGBT circles, where Schaffner and Moyer saw the male homosexual as privileged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; DAM! has been described as intentionally pluralistic, embracing many identities and issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Tram|date=2013|title=From SlutWalks to SuicideGirls: Feminist Resistance in the Third Wave and Postfeminist Era|jstor=23611512|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3/4|pages=157–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Schaffner's experience as a commercial photographer and Moyer's work as a designer and painter, the duo captured and created images reminiscent of commercial advertising but delivered messages that raised the profile of lesbians. This material was then placed where ads were typically seen, such as [[bus stop]]s, [[telephone booth]]s, and construction site barricades.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|last=Summers|first=Claude J.|date=2004|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=9781573441919|pages=256|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAM!'s method of presenting lesbian activist art in typically commercial landscapes creates an effect described by some as "slick subvertising"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bitchmedia.org/issue/10|title=Profile: Dyke Action Machine—Slick subvertising on the streets of New York City|last=Jervis|first=Lisa|year=1999|website=Bitch Magazine Volume 10|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "agit-prop".&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Nayland and Lawrence Rinder.

'''Francesca Martinez''' (born 1978) is an English comedian, writer and actress, born in London to a Spanish father and half-Swedish, half-English mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dugan |first=Emily |title=Francesca Martinez: A wobbly girl's battle against the last taboo |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/francesca-martinez-a-wobbly-girls-battle-against-the-last-taboo-1816861.html |work=The Independent |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has [[cerebral palsy]] but prefers to describe herself as "wobbly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bunbury|first=Stephanie |title=Wobbly but on the money |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/24/1048354540942.html |work=The Age |date=25 March 2003 |accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has had many sell-out shows at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and internationally, including the [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]], the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]], the [[Perth Festival]], and the [[Just For Laughs]] Festival in Montreal. In 2014 she completed a 68-date UK/Ireland tour and has had multiple off-West End London runs at the [[Tricycle Theatre]], the [[Hackney Empire]], and the [[Soho Theatre]].

==Comedy==
In 2000, Martinez became the first female comic to win the prestigious Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award at the Edinburgh Festival.

In 2003 she was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

Martinez has performed sell-out shows in many countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, [[Malaysia]], Singapore, South Africa, the United States, performing at [[Caroline's on Broadway]], [[92YTribeca]] and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] (all in New York City), and the [[Laugh Factory]] and the [[Comedy Store]] (both in Los Angeles). She also performed at the 2008 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], alongside [[Emma Thompson]].

Her tour 'WHAT THE **** IS NORMAL?!' clocked up over 130 dates around the world – winning a Fringe Media Network Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as being nominated for Best Show at Dave's Leicester Comedy Festival and at the Perth Festival, Australia.

She has organised many charity shows featuring comedians such as [[Jo Brand]], [[Johnny Vegas]], [[Al Murray]], [[Richard Herring]], [[Stewart Lee]], [[Jeremy Hardy]], [[Lee Mack]], [[Mark Thomas]], [[Rhod Gilbert]], and [[Milton Jones]].

In 2014, her best-selling book 'WHAT THE **** IS NORMAL?! was published by [[Random House]] to critical acclaim. It has been nominated for the Chortle Comedy 'Best Book' Award and The Bread And Roses Radical Publishing Award.

==Television and radio==
Before becoming a comedian Martinez appeared in the [[BBC]] children's drama series ''[[Grange Hill]]'' from 1994–1998, and has acted in other drama series such as ''[[Holby City]]''.

In August 2005 she appeared in the BBC sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Extras episodes#Series 1 .282005.29]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008 Martinez made global headlines when (live on [[Channel 4 News]]) she became the first [[Olympic torch]] bearer to pull out of the London relay in protest over China's treatment of Tibet.

In April 2009 she appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] stand-up comedy show, [[4 Stands Up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f4ptw |title=BBC Radio 4 – 4 Stands Up |publisher=BBC |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 she made her debut appearance on BBC Radio 4's topical panel show ''[[The News Quiz]]'', alongside regulars [[Jeremy Hardy]] and [[Sandi Toksvig]]. She appeared on ''The News Quiz'' again in January and July 2013.

Martinez has become a regular face on television, including appearances on ''[[The Frank Skinner Show]],'' in [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s comedy series ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' [[BBC Three]], [[The Jonathan Ross Show]], ITV's [[Loose Women]], ''[[Free Speech]]'' BBC3, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s ''[[The Saturday Night Show]]'' with [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]], ''[[Adam Hills Tonight]]'' and ''Spicks &amp; Specks''.

==Campaigner==
On 8 December 2012, Martinez launched a campaign ''War on Welfare''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |title=Martinez brings star quality to fresh assault on coalition's 'war on welfare' – Disability in the News |publisher=The Fed Online |accessdate=21 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204013255/http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which pledged to get 100,000 supporters to sign a petition calling for an end to government cuts for [[disability benefits]] and an independent impact assessment of the government's welfare changes. The petition attracted 5,000 signatures in the first 48 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/17717 |title=Welfare petition aims for ten thousand backers by New Year's Day |publisher=Ekklesia |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved its target of 100,000 supporters on 30 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/war-welfare-petition-100000-sign-2870513|title=100,000 sign War on Welfare petition asking for assessment of cuts to the sick and disabled|first=Steve|last=Robson|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outspoken opponent of welfare reform by the government, she uses her public profile to raise issues about disability and fight for a fairer system. Martinez said: "As a disabled person in the media, I want to help give this issue a voice. It's morally wrong for the government to target those in need instead of saving money by targeting the real causes of this crisis – and close tax loopholes and regulate the financial sector. To me, it's a human rights issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|title=Disability Information Scotland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130423211500/http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is patron of a number of charities.&lt;ref name=Personally&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/francesca-martinez/ |title=Francesca Martinez – Personally Speaking Bureau|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team/|title=Our Team – Contact a Family|accessdate=16 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604052159/http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has challenged the government in numerous TV interviews, including on ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[This Week (BBC TV series)|This Week]]''.

Martinez has become a respected social commentator, speaking at meetings and demos across the UK, as well as being a key part of the People's Assembly Against Austerity.

In 2015 she helped organise [[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]], a one-day event on climate and social justice, with [[Naomi Klein]], [[Russell Brand]], and many other speakers. The event was streamed globally and aimed to kick-start a movement to unify the left against climate change.

In 2013 she was nominated for a Women in Public Life Award, and won the Public Affairs Achiever of the Year Award. In April 2014 she was named as one of Britain's most influential women in the BBC Woman's Hour power list 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's Hour Power List 2014 – Game Changers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03zy4m5/profiles|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also nominated for Red Magazine's Woman of the Year Award 2014 and for a European Diversity Hero of the Year Award 2014.

In July 2015, Martinez endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bush|first=Stephen|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/25-campaign-groups-and-activists-back-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader|title=25 campaign groups and activists back Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, along with numerous other celebrities, she toured the UK to support Corbyn's bid to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="jc4pmtour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jc4pmtour.com/|title=#JC4PM|publisher=jc4pmtour|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12134051/Celebrities-to-tour-Britain-in-Jeremy-Corbyn-For-Prime-Minister-musical-show.html|title=Celebrities to tour Britain in 'Jeremy Corbyn For Prime Minister' musical show|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, she performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="doncasterfreepress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|work= |location=Doncaster|publisher=''[[Doncaster Free Press]]''|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''G7 Method''' is a printing procedure used for visually accurate color reproduction by putting emphasis on matching grayscale colorimetric measurements between processes. G7 stands for '''g'''rayscale plus '''seven''' colors: the [[subtractive colors]] typically used in printing (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) and the [[additive colors]] (Red, Green, and Blue). The method is used in many applications of printing such as [[offset lithography]], [[flexography]], and [[gravure]] since it uses a one-dimensional neutral print density curve (NPDC) to match neutral tonality between two G7 calibrated printing systems. The G7 method is not a completely accurate color management system nor is it officially standardized by the [[International Color Consortium]] (ICC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idealliance.org/specifications/g7/what-g7 |title=What is G7? |publisher=IDEAlliance |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The G7 method was created by Don Hutcheson, chairman of the IDEAlliance GRACoL (International Digital Enterprise Alliance, General Requirements for Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography) in 2006. It was created to solve the problem of [[computer to plate]] (CtP) printing systems and other devices printing images with different tonal value increases (TVIs), or [[dot gain]]s. Also, professionals in the printing industry follow the [[International Organization for Standardization]]’s (ISO) principles of [[half-tone]] printing, called ISO 12647-2, which does not specify colorimetric values for gray balance and refers to multiple TVI curves. This results in an ambiguous definition of the print’s final ‘appearance’.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.efi.com/~/media/Files/EFI/Fiery/Fiery%20Digital%20Print%20Servers/Demystifying%20Color%20Standards_hr.pdf |title=Demystifying Color Standards |publisher=W3.efi.com |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G7 method solved this problem by creating Neutral Print Density Curves (NPDC) that related neutral density to the half-tone dot percentages of a print image rather than a TVI curve relating the input dot percentage to the output gain relative to the input percentage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Definition==

===Basic Set-up===
To calibrate a printing system with the G7 method, it basically entails comparing the NPDC generated by the device to the ‘ideal’ NPDC given in G7 specifications, calibrating the [[Raster Image Processor]] (RIP) or the driver of the device, and then repeating the NPDC comparison to check for accuracy. More specifically, one dimensional interpolation between the NPDC graph generated by the printer and the GRACoL 7 NPDC “FanGraph” must be done to generate new dot percentage aim values to be given to the device’s RIP or driver.&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"&gt;[http://www.aptec.hkprinters.org/IDEAlliance-China/resource_centre/free_resources/08-G7_how-to_v6 ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorimetry===
The G7 method's emphasis on grayscale calibration is loosely based around the concept of neutralizing the camera image of a scene using a [[gray card]]. This is done to lower the effects of lighting conditions, such as [[color temperature]], on the resulting image. G7 takes this further by defining percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink at which the image should be gray balanced. It also defines values for a* and b* for the [[Lab color space]].&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"/&gt;

Most printing systems use [[half-tone]]s to generate images by using a series of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black dots to recreate colors. This is done by varying the size of the dots so that the human eye can spatially integrate the image's color and make it look like one uniform color.

===Benefits and disadvantages===
Using the G7 method for printing calibration is a manual process and is device independent, meaning it can be used for any printing devices that allows manipulation of the [[raster image processor]] or [[computer to plate]] curve information that dictates how digital signals from an image is printed with ink.

However, since the G7 method relies mostly on gray balance, if the image does not contain much gray information, the calibration can be inaccurate. Also, using any offset printing may be difficult to gray balance because it involves "wet-trapping" which can lead to unpredictable values for dark tones.&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"/&gt;

==Software==
'''IDEAlink Curve'''
Calibration using the G7 method involves comparing two NPDCs from the G7 Fangraph to calculate new aim values that will be given to the printer's RIP files. This can be a manual process, but the IDEAlink curve software, created by IDEAlliance, does this automatically and with minimal error. Improvements to this program include Curve2 and Curve3. ''IDEAlink Curve 1.1 software is no longer commercially available''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certified G7 Systems {{!}} Idealliance|url = http://www.idealliance.org/certifications/g7-certifications/g7-system-certification/certified-g7-systems|website = www.idealliance.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the list below for systems and software that have received G7 System Certification.

IDEAlliance certifies systems and software that meet or exceed established industry tolerances for excellence and are capable of calibrating a printing device to meet the G7 grayscale definition using four 1-D curves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

The Genesis Foundation was founded in January 2001 by [[investment banker]] and [[arts patron]] John J. Studzinski, CBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/john-studzinski/|title=John Studzinski|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then it has donated over £13 million primarily to its partner organisations to develop and mentor artistic talent from diverse backgrounds. The Foundation spends up to £1 million annually on its ongoing programmes with its partner organisations, all of which operate under the leadership of inspired artistic directors.

In October 2017 John Studzinski received the 2017 UK Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award for his work with the Genesis Foundation and its support of young artistic talent through long-term partnerships with artistic leaders. Others receiving the annual award include the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], [[Simon Rattle|Sir Simon Rattle]], [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Yoko Ono]].

In 2017 the scholarship programme was replaced by the Genesis Network which provides mentoring to LAMDA final year students by pairing them with a graduate mentor to support them as they complete their training and enter the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamda.ac.uk/our-courses/genesis-lamda-network|title=Genesis LAMDA Network {{!}} LAMDA|website=www.lamda.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixteen===
Since 2010, the Genesis Foundation has collaborated with British [[chamber choir]] [[The Sixteen]] and funded Genesis Sixteen, the annual free young artists’ scheme for 18-23 year old ensemble singers. Genesis Sixteen provides group tuition, individual mentoring and masterclasses run by vocal experts.

The Genesis Foundation also [[Commission (art)|commissions]] new choral pieces from leading and emerging composers, which are then premiered and recorded by [[Harry Christophers]] and The Sixteen for their record label CORO. The world premiere of James MacMillan’s Stabat mater, a 60-minute work for choir and string orchestra commissioned by the Genesis Foundation, was given its UK premiere by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and [[Britten Sinfonia]] at the Barbican Centre, London in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/reviews-james-macmillan-stabat-mater/|title=Reviews for James MacMillan Stabat Mater|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its recording was favourably reviewed, and it won numerous awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/reviews-for-james-macmillan-stabat-mater-recording/|title=Reviews for James MacMillan: Stabat Mater recording|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 it became the first concert to be live-streamed from the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/stabat-mater/|title=Stabat mater|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/the-vatican-premiere-of-stabat-mater-in-the-sistine-chapel/|title=The Vatican premiere of&amp;nbsp;Stabat mater&amp;nbsp;in the Sistine Chapel|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, four new commissions led by Sir James MacMillan were premiered at [[Eton College Chapel]] and live-streamed. The commissions were all based on texts from the [[Eton Choirbook]] and were performed alongside works from the [[Choirbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/news/the-eton-choirbook-and-its-legacy-of-sacred-music-a-new-work-by-sir-james-macmillan-cbe-and-three-other-new-genesis-foundation-commissions-from-philip-cooke-marco-galvani-joseph-phibbs/|title=THE ETON CHOIRBOOK AND ITS LEGACY OF SACRED MUSIC A new work by Sir James MacMillan CBE And three other new Genesis Foundation commissions from Philip Cooke, Marco Galvani &amp; Joseph Phibbs|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 9 February 2016 the Genesis Foundation, in collaboration with the Choral Foundation, brought together leaders of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of England]] for the first service according to the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church to be celebrated since the 1550s at [[Hampton Court Palace]]’s Chapel Royal.

The Vespers’ service was  performed by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and Genesis Sixteen. The ensembles sang [[Thomas Tallis]]’s ''Magnificat'', [[William Cornysh]]'s ''Salve Regina'' and [[John Taverner]]’s ''‘Leroy’ Kyrie.'' Members of the public were offered the chance to attend the service through a free ballot hosted by [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].

The service was celebrated by[[Vincent Nichols|Cardinal Vincent Nichols]] and included a sermon from [[Richard Chartres]], KCVO, Bishop of London and Dean of Her Majesty’s Chapels Royal – Vespers was dedicated to [[John the Baptist]]. Prior to the service, the Cardinal and Dean were in conversation under the heading ''Faith and the Crown'' in Hampton Court Palace’s ''Great Hall''. Their discussion addressed the relationship between the two churches and [[Monarchy|the monarchy]].

A '''gu''' is type of ancient [[Chinese ritual bronze]] vessel from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties (i.e. 1600–256 BC). It was used to drink wine or to offer ritual [[libation]]s.

A gu is tall and slender, with a slightly flared base that tapers to a slim center section before widening again into a trumpet-like mouth, wider than the base. Its surface is often decorated with '' [[taotie]] ''.

A gu from the Shang dynasty was among the 13 works of art stolen from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] on 18 March 1990, along with paintings by [[Rembrandt]] and [[Vermeer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardnermuseum.org/FILE/1691.pdf "Fact Sheet: Stolen Artworks."] ''Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.'' Retrieved 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gu with animal mask.jpg|thumb|A gu from the middle Shang Dynasty, [[Shanghai Museum]], Shanghai, China]]

==The Beginning of the ''gu'' vessel==
The gu vessel was known for its use as a wine drinking vessel.  It is said to have developed from other elaborate cups that also had high stems and were found in [[Neolithic]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, J. and Bunker, E. ''Ancient Chinese and Ordos Bronzes'' 1990 pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions have been found on ancient vessels stating that it was common to drink wine in Chinese cultures.  The creation of a vessel such as the ''gu'' makes sense in modern times because of its shape.  The long stem made it easy to hold and sip from, while still allowing it to take on unique and elegant features.

==Early inspiration for the creation of the gu vessel==
Throughout the hundreds of Neolithic to early dynastic sites discovered in [[China]], ritual vessels ranging from clay to bronze are often found in the tombs of these sites.  The form, shapes, and décor, provide hints to the every vessel’s function as well as the early beliefs that inspired them.  Early Chinese religion has been difficult for scholars to understand due to a lack of extensive archaeological evidence on Neolithic religious philosophies and ritual practices.&lt;ref name="Smith, Howard 1961"&gt;Smith, Howard. Chinese Religion in the Shang Dynasty. Numen. Vol. 8.  Brill, 1961., 143&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Shang Dynasty, however, had a much more concrete religion in regards to beliefs and practices ranging from ancestor worship to funerary rituals, and a developed system to perform sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Smith, Howard 1961"/&gt;   As these beliefs could have extended back into earlier periods in China, a common center of worship included such elements such as ancestors, fertility concerns as well as other spirits or gods of the natural elements.&lt;ref name="Smith, Howard 1961"/&gt;
   
[[File:Gu wine vessel from the Shang Dynasty (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|150 px|A gu from the Shang Dynasty, [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]], Washington, D.C.]]

The ritual vessels of early China are an extension of the spiritual or religious world, in which the powers that seemed to exist in nature may have carried a high influence in the inspiration of the vessels.  The powers of nature included those that could have resided in animals, plants, water, sickness, death, and eventually the afterlife, all of which coexisted with people as having a high influence on one's life.&lt;ref name="Smith, Howard 1961"/&gt;  In some cases, ritual vessels provided a way to maintain harmony between the spirit world and the earthly realm through vessels holding sacrifices, or vessels like the gu being drunk by humans in ritual ceremonies.

== Function and use==
The ''gu'' was a common wine vessel to be found in high class areas.  This wine vessel has been found in places such as meeting areas were high class Chinese members would gather for wine with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Guo li gu gong bo wu yuan 國立故宮博物院, Catalogue of the Special Exhibition of Shang and Chou Dynasty Bronze Wine Vessels 商周青銅酒器特展圖錄(Taibei: Zhonghua min guo Taibei Shi Shilin qu Weishuangxi &amp; Guo li gu gong bo wu yuan, 1989), 124 &amp; 125&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gu'' vessel can be unique in a number of ways.  The more elegant styled vessels with more relief and design would be found more commonly in the high class surroundings.  The simpler, tall and narrow, ''gu'' vessels would be found throughout the family's households.  
According to the Tsun family, the ''gu'' vessel was found to be listed under the "Wine Containers" list of artifacts that have been found in the Shang civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;New Haven and London Yale University Press ''Shang Civilization'' 1980 pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows archaeologists to focus on locations of ''gu'' vessels to help indicate the class status of the site.

===Examples of function===
In Book 6, verse 25, of the Confucian Analects, a gu is referred to as a cup to be drunk from specifically in religious sites but first by the rulers of the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref name="Alt, Wayne 2005"&gt;Alt, Wayne.  Ritual and the Social Construction of Sacred Artifacts: An Analysis of “Analects” 6.25. Philosophy East and West, Vol. 55, No. 3. University of Hawaii Press, 2005., 461&lt;/ref&gt;   Its functional use for a human rather than a spirit is also noted based on the construction of the gu vessel for its design is logical in that it can hold liquid and can be easily held in one’s hand unlike other wine vessels.&lt;ref name="Alt, Wayne 2005"/&gt;

The only evidence we have of ritual use of this vessel is its strong association with wine, spirits, and high class rulers. Later engraved vessels help support the significance of ritual wine drinking as part of ritual ceremony.  The ''gu'' vessel appears in an engraving of a ritual scene found on a yi vessel discovered in a tomb in Shaanxi in which the ''gu'' being used in the engraving highly resembles the gu of the Shang.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, Mary H. The Origin of Chinese Representation of the Human Figure. Artibus Asiae. Vol. 49, No. ½ (1988-1989),  11&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name==
The term gu had not been ever previously found inscribed on any other vessels and the first mention of this term was not until the 11th century found in early artist and antiquarian, Li Gonglin’s writings.&lt;ref name="Harrist, Robert E 1995"&gt;Harrist, Robert E. The Artist as Antiquarian: Li Gonglin and His Study of Early Chinese Art. Artibus Asiae. Vol. 55, No. ¾ (1995), 261&lt;/ref&gt;   Li, a painter and avid collector of early bronzes, is credited for designating the name of the gu vessel based on an experiment on a gu vessel he owned. In his experiment, he measures that his gu vessel can hold exactly two pints or ''sheng'' of liquid which is equal to a ''gu'' while the designated character means “ridge” or "flange" based on those decorative elements found on his gu.&lt;ref name="Harrist, Robert E 1995"/&gt;

==Historical developments and examples==
Although ''gu'' is name of a bronze vessel form, similar vessels have been made of clay and wood long before the [[Bronze Age]].

===Bronze ''gu''===
Based on archaeological discoveries, ''gu'' is one of the most common bronze vessel forms in the [[Shang Dynasty]](around 16th century to 11th century B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Rituals'' (London : British Museum Publications, 1987), 65 - 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Xiaoneng Yang points out that ''gu'' became less popular in the [[Western Zhou|Western Zhou Dynasty]] (around 11th century to 8th century B. C.), but the style of the late Shang period, or rather the Anyang Style, survived and the style of the early Shang period also revived. Moreover, ''gu'' disappeared in the reign of [[King Mu of Zhou]] in the 10th century B.C.E.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;Xiaoneng Yang, ed., ''The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology: Celebrated Discoveries from the People's Republic of China'' (Washington, D. C.: National Gallery of Art, 1999), 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zhengzhou phase (Erligang period) of the Shang Dynasty====
One bronze ''gu'' has been discovered at the north corner of the upper level of the Tomb M2 in [[Erligang culture|Erligang, Zhengzhou]], an early Shang Dynasty site.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Western Zhou Ritual Bronzes from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections'' (Washington D.C.: Sackler Foundation/Cambridge: Sackler Museum, 1990), 14 - 15. Robert Bagley, "Shang Archaeology", in ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'', edited by Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 169 - 170.[https://books.google.com/books?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=gu+erligang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y_Iuow4e3G&amp;sig=LexW13OFMVwVdaHJC1aQe_T5g24&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sWi9UJODJYzg8AT01YHgCg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=gu%20erligang&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Decors on this vessel are concentrated on a band at the lower part of its body, which, according to [[Max Loehr]], is a characteristic of Early Shang bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Hung Wu, ''Monumentality in Early Chinese Art and Architecture'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''gu'' from Erligang has some cross-shape holes on its foot, which is a common feature among some Shang bronzes. For example, all the ''gu'' vessels and some other bronzes from [[Chenggu County|Chenggu, Shaanxi]] have this kind of cross-shape holes, though their diverse decors and shapes suggest they might have been made in different time periods in the Shang Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Shouzhi 王壽芝, "Shanxi Chenggu Chutu de Shangdai Qingtong Qi 陝西城固出土的商代青銅器", ''Wenbo''文博 6 (1988), 3 - 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anyang phase of the Shang Dynasty====
Huge changes had taken place before the capital of Shang moved to [[Yinxu|Yin]], Shang's last capital.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, "The Zhengzhou Phase (the Erligang Period", in ''The Great Bronze Age of China: An Exhibition from the People’s Republic of China'', edited by [[Wen Fong]] (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1980), 98 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gu'' also changed in Anyang phase. First, ''gu'' at this time was usually higher than 20 centimeters with slim body and a wide mouth. [[Fu Hao|Fu Hao ''gu'']] from Anyang is 25.5-centimeter-high and its mouth is 14.2-centimeter-wide, which significantly surpasses its bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo Qingtong Qi Quanji Bianji Weiyuanhui 中國青銅器全集編輯委員會, ed., ''Zhouguo Qingtong Qi Quanji'' 中國青銅器全集, Vol. 2 （Beijing : Wen wu chu ban she， 1997）， 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Chü ''gu'', also found from a tomb at Anyang, is about 31-centimeter-high and its mouth is almost twice as wide as its bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Thorp, ''Spirit and Ritual: The Morse Collection of Ancient Chinese Art'' (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1982), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, from this time onward, the base of ''gu'' raised up slightly with a short round foot. The ''gu'' displayed in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery| Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Washington D. C.]] and the [[Shanghai Museum|Shanghai Museum, Shanghai]], whose pictures are shown on this page, possess this feature. Third, some ''gu'' also have decors that extend from its waist to the rim of the mouth in three triangle registers.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Rituals'', 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beijing Tushuguan 北京圖書館, ed., ''Beijing Tushuguan Cang Qingtong Qi Quanxing Tapian Ji'' 北京圖書館藏青銅器全形拓片集, Vol. 3 (Beijing: Beijing Tushuguan Chubanshe, 1997), 74–108. {{ISBN|7501312850}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, bronze vessels made in Anyang phase are usually fully decorated with decors.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, ''Monumentality in Early Chinese Art and Architecture'', 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Western Zhou Dynasty====
Imitations or revivals of former styles appear in the late Shang period and early Western Zhou period. [[Jessica Rawson]] has pointed out a ''gu'' that is 28.5-centimeter-high with a ''[[taotie]]'' motif on its waist celebrates the early Shang styles by locating its decors on one band.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Western Zhou Ritual Bronzes from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043126/http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/1668bye2954.html Lü Fu Yi ''gu''] found in [[Shi Qiang pan|the Hoard of the Wei Family]]. This vessel is 25.2-centimeter-high and its mouth is about 13.2-centimeter-wide.&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt; Its neck is long and slim without any decorations. Low ribbon-like relief appears at the lower section of the vessel and it does not have a foot.

====Middle Western Zhou Dynasty====
In the middle Western Zhou period, ''gu'' became short and squat, while gradually disappeared. Wan Qi ''gu'' can be dated back to the mid-Western Zhou Dynasty.&lt;ref name="Guo Li"&gt;Guo li gu gong bo wu yuan 國立故宮博物院, Catalogue of the Special Exhibition of Shang and Chou Dynasty Bronze Wine Vessels 商周青銅酒器特展圖錄,125.&lt;/ref&gt; This ''gu'' is about 14.5 centimeter high with a 14.7-centimeter-wide mouth and a 10.1&amp;nbsp;cm-wide-base. Meanwhile, this ''gu'''s waist is only slightly narrower than its month and base. Another ''gu'' discovered in a hoard in Zhangjiapo, [[Shaanxi]], is similar in shape, but a little bit smaller.&lt;ref name="Guo Li"/&gt;

===Ceramic ''gu''===
Modern Chinese archaeologists have identified numbers of neolithic pottery wine drinking vessels as ''gu'' or "''gu''-shape vessel". Besides, Ceramic ''gu'' continued to exist even after it transformed into a bronze vessel.

====The Neolithic Age====
Numbers of pottery vessels unearthed from [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic]] sites are named as ''gu'' by archaeologists. Some of these pottery ''gu'' look very different from the form of bronze ''gu'', while some appear similar and might be the direct ancestors of bronze ''gu''. 
 
[http://www.sdmuseum.com/english/Collections-Pottery-29.html A gray pottery beaker] discovered at a [[Dawenkou culture]] site in [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]] is categorized as a "''gu''-shape vessel".&lt;ref&gt;"Gray Pottery Gu-beaker", Shandong Museum, accessed Nov. 6, 2012, http://www.sdmuseum.com/english/Collections-Pottery-29.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is 29.2-centimeter-high and can be roughly divided into 3 sections. The top section is a funnel shape container. Nonetheless, the other two sections distinguish this vessel form a bronze ''gu''. The middle section is a long stem, decorated with engraved grooves and a high rising band. The lower section is its stand with three square legs.

Some pottery drinking vessels excavated in the late [Dawenkou culture|Dawenkou sites] appear more similar to the bronze ''gu''.&lt;ref name="Lv"&gt;Lv Qichang 呂琪昌, ''Qingtong Jue &amp; Jia de Mimi'' 青銅爵、斝的秘密.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|222–223}} A pottery ''gu'' that looks striking similar to bronze ''gu'' has been excavated at Shilipu (十里鋪), [[Henan]].&lt;ref name="Lv"/&gt;{{rp|214}} This ''gu'' is 13.6-centimeter-high with four rising bands as decorations. Its body looks almost like a column , but gets wider at the mouth. Similar pottery objects have been found in other areas as well and these objects are suggested to be the predecessors of bronze ''gu''.&lt;ref name="Lv"/&gt;{{rp|222–223}}

====The Bronze Age====
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - pottery gu.jpg|thumb|upright|A pottery ''gu'' discovered in 1960 at the Erlitou sites]]
Pottery ''gu'' discovered from Erlitou and Erligang suggest they might have direct relation with the bronze ''gu''.&lt;ref name="Lv"/&gt;{{rp|208–209 &amp; 215–216}} As mentioned above, pottery ''gu'' coexisted with bronze ''gu'' in the [[Bronze Age]], but their shapes are not entirely identical.

[[Erlitou culture]] has been considered as a part of the [[Bronze Age]], although scholars still have disputes in identifying it as the capital of the [[Xia Dynasty]], China's first dynasty recorded by historical texts, or an early [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;Kuang-Chih Chang, "The Chinese Bronze Age: A Modern Synthesis", in ''The Great Bronze Age of China: An Exhibition from the People’s Republic of China'', ed. Wen Fong (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1980), 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; A pottery ''gu'' discovered in [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] is a funnel-shape cup, which becomes narrow at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sach.gov.cn:8080/www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/318/InfoID/21682/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it has a raised-up foot that gets wider at the bottom, which make its outlook similar to bronze ''gu''.&lt;ref&gt;"Tao Gu 陶觚", ''Zaoqi Zhongguo: Zhonghua Wenming Qiyuan Zhan'' 早期中國：中華文明起源展, last modified Oct. 11, 2009, http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/1094/InfoID/21682/Default.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pottery ''gu'' are found in [[Anyang]] and some other Shang sites in the heyday of the Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;Guo li gu gong bo wu yuan 國立故宮博物院, ''Catalogue of the Special Exhibition of Shang and Chou Dynasty Bronze Wine Vessels'' 商周青銅酒器特展圖錄, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; A pottery ''gu'' from a tomb that can be dated to the reign of [[King Zu Geng|Zugeng (祖庚)]] or [[Zu Jia|Zu Jia (祖甲)]] in Anyang. The shape of this ''gu'' is very similar to bronze ''gu'' at the same period, though its waist is thicker.&lt;ref&gt;Kwang-Chih Chang, ''Shang Civilization'' (New Heaven and London: Yale University Press, 1980), 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; It have some long scratched slashes covered its surface as decor.

====Later time period====
''Gu'' continues to exist after the [[Bronze Age]], but it was used as vase instead of a wine drinking vessel. A ''gu'' with tubular handles, glazed in light greyish-blue in the [[National Palace Museum]], for example, imitates the shape of bronze ''gu'', but it functions as a vase.&lt;ref&gt;Guoli Gugong Bowuyuan, Guan Ware of the Southern Song Dynasty, Vol. 1 (Hong Kong: Cafa, 1962), 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquered ''gu''===
Bianjiashan （卞家山） in [[Zhejiang]] has yielded numbers of lacquered vessels and ''gu'' is a major vessel type.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;Zhao Ye 趙曄, "Tanmi Bianjiashan 探秘卞家山", ''Dongfang Bowu 東方博物'', 24 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43, 45}} These ''gu''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaogu.cn/cn/detail.asp?Productid=15264&lt;/ref&gt; have slim waist and wide-opened mouth and they are coated with black and red lacquer with some rising bands as decorations.&lt;ref name="Zhao"/&gt; Archaeologists date Bianjiashan back to the [[Liangzhu culture|late Liangzhu Culture period]] and suggest these ''gu'' may have certain connections with bronze ''gu'' in the Shang Dynasty.&lt;ref name="Zhao"/&gt;{{rp|41 &amp; 43}}

[[File:Hanging bowl DSCF6984.jpg|thumb|300px|Another hanging bowl from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]
[[File:FelmershamBrozeBowl.JPG|thumb|Bowl found in [[Bedfordshire]].]]

'''Hanging bowls''' are a distinctive type of artifact of the period between the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] in c. 410 AD and the emergence of the [[Christian]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms during the 7th century.  The surviving examples have mostly been found in Anglo-Saxon graves, but there is general agreement that they reflect [[Celtic art|Celtic traditions of decoration]].

The bowls are usually of thin beaten [[bronze]], between 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm (6-12&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, and dished or [[cauldron]]-shaped in profile. Typically they have three decorative plates ('escutcheons') applied externally just below the rim to support hooks with rings, by which they were suspended. The ornament of these plates is often very sophisticated, and in many cases includes beautiful coloured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] work, commonly in [[champlevé]] and using spiral motifs. Although their designs and manufacture are thought to proceed from [[Celtic art|Celtic]] technique, they are principally found in eastern Britain, and especially in the areas which received Anglo-Saxon acculturation. Their production is also evidenced in [[Pict]]ish and [[Ireland|Irish]] contexts, but they seem almost completely absent from [[Wales]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].

[[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]]'s ''corpus'' gives the following breakdown of the locations in modern terms of the 174 finds he includes (many are just one or more elements of a bowl):&lt;ref&gt;Table 2, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
:England 117, Scotland 7, Ireland 17
:Norway 26, Sweden 2, Denmark 1,
:Germany 2, Belgium 1, Netherlands 1

== Function ==
The bowls are enigmatic because their intended function is not certainly known. Many have finely-worked escutcheons set centrally within, which makes it unlikely that they could have contained opaque or sticky material such as lamp-fat. The theory that they were used as maritime [[compass]]es, with a magnetic pin floated on water within the bowl, is discounted because many have an iron band around the rim which would render this unworkable. Another opinion is that they were used for the Roman custom of mixing [[wine]] and water for service at table. Some bowls are too small to make this explanation workable if general potation were intended. However, in ritual Christian or other meals it would be possible for a group to dip bread into such a wine-bowl in imitation of the Last Supper.
[[File:12 - 000,w,150v.jpg|thumb|left|Evangelist portrait of Saint John from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]]; the roundels above the columns appear to copy hanging bowl escutcheons.]]

Part of the puzzle lies in whether the bowls were normally suspended by threads from a central [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] (like a lamp), or from hooks on a tripod with tall wooden legs. There is some support for the latter view, because the nearest formal parallel for such bowls from Antique contexts is in depictions of the ''[[Oracular Cortina]]'', a three-hooked bowl suspended within a tripod, over which the priestess sat when pronouncing oracles. Certainly if water were contained in the bowls it is more likely to have been for ritual or liturgical purposes than for general consumption owing to the limited capacity. This would therefore be 'special' water, perhaps consecrated for baptism or aspersion, or (in other religious circumstances) derived from a sacred source or spring. 'Tripods' are also mentioned as prizes for warriors in early literature, including the early Welsh.

== Motifs ==
Some bowls have clearly Christian motifs on their escutcheons. The spiral ornament developed through the 6th to 7th century invention of the 'trumpet-spiral' pattern, which was afterwards adopted from these enamels and incorporated into the repertoire of the famous painted Gospel-books such as the [[Book of Durrow]] or the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. This painted decoration was certainly intended for meditative contemplation and as a devotional work. From the very mixed cultures and beliefs of the inhabitants of Britain during the Dark Ages, the art, and perhaps some part of the function of these bowls became absorbed into the Celto-Saxon ornamental language of Christian Britain. Among the finest examples is the large bowl from the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship-burial (near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]]), which has an enameled fish sculpture set to swivel on a pin within the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/h/hanging_bowl_from_the_ship-bur.aspx British Museum] Hanging bowl from the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on church plate==
The distinctive shape of the two most famous early Irish [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s, the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]] has been described as an adaptation of the hanging bowl form for a different use,&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Patrick. in Youngs, 131&lt;/ref&gt; although others see them as using shapes derived from Byzantine metalwork.

The hanging bowls have been discussed in detail by many scholars, among them [[John Romilly Allen]], [[Françoise Henry]], [[T. D.

The '''Indian National Theatre''' (INT) is a [[theatre]] organisation and troupe founded in 1944 and based in [[Mumbai]], India. Although performing predominantly [[Gujarati theatre]], the troupe has also produced a number of plays in other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]]. In addition to theatre productions, the troupe also carries theatre education, training and research activities.

==History==

In 1940, on the 50th birthday of [[Dhansukhlal Mehta]], [[Chandravadan Mehta]] and his troupe improvised a [[revue]] performance named ''Ranglila''. The performance featured elements from ''Bhattnu Bhopalu'' (Bhatt's Hypocrisy) by [[Navalram Pandya]], ''Nawabni Mulakat'' (Nawab's Visit) by [[Ramanbhai Neelkanth]], ''Ashok Parsi Hato'' (Ashok Was [[Parsi]]) by [[Jyotindra Dave]] and ''Narmad'' by Chandravadan Mehta. Such performances, although initially improvised, gradually evolved into organised theatrical activities. In 1944, the Indian National Theatre (INT) was founded in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), with Damubhai Jhaveri as its first General Secretary. Other members associated with the founding included Mansukh Joshi, Gautam Joshi, Naran Mistry and Chandravadan Bhatt with D. G. Vyas providing guidance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56096332|title=History of Gujarati theatre|last=Baradi|first=Hasmukh|author-link=Hasmukh Baradi|date=2003|publisher=[[National Book Trust]], India|year=2003|isbn=8123740328|edition=English 1st|location=New Delhi|pages=143|chapter=New Theatre: Phase Two: Theatre Troupe (1939-1949)|oclc=56096332|orig-year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1942, members of [[Socialism|socialist]] youth groups who supported the [[Quit India Movement]] sought to use the fledgling theatre scene as a tool for public education, resulting in arrests and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Early performances by the theatre were of ballets or dance-dramas, such as ''Kalbhairav'' and ''Bhukh'' (Hunger), written by [[Avinash Vyas]]
and directed by Yogendra Desai.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Gujarati Vishwakosh]]|last=Joshi|first=Probodh|publisher=Gujarati Vishwakosh Trust|year=|isbn=|edition=1st|volume=2|location=Ahmedabad|publication-date=October 1990|pages=703-705|language=gu|chapter=Indian National Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe used two lorries for a stage and to travel around [[Bombay Province]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0220|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre|last=Baradi|first=Hasmukh|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=|year=2004|isbn=0195644468|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=New Delhi|pages=|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0220|oclc=56986659|via=Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Gujarati theatre, the troupe also performed at least one Marathi play. In 1947, Shanti Bhushan directed a dance-drama of ''Discovery of India'', based on the [[Discovery of India|book of the same name]] by Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], at which he was also present and drew his appreciation, on the occasion of the Asian Relations Conference. Other big productions during this period included ''Narsaiyo'' on [[Narsinh Mehta]], ''Meera'' on [[Mirabai]] and ''Amrapali''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1949, the INT began performing Gujarati plays such as ''Lagnani Bedi'' (Fetters of Marriage), a Gujarati adaptation of [[Acharya Atre]]'s Marathi play of the same name,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; directed by Chadravadan Bhatt.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This play also saw the first pre-sale of tickets. It was followed by a mystery play ''Snehna Jher'' (Poison of Love) in which different scenes were simultaneously performed on a partitioned stage. One of the founding members of the INT, Naran Mistry, also directed a number of successful plays. Productions in other Indian languages, such as the Parsi ''Mota Dilna Mota Bava'' (Parsi Man with Big Heart) and ''Shirinbainu Shantiniketan'' (Shirinbai's Shantiniketan) also began, as well as one-act plays by Firoze Antia, ''Chalo Jher Pao'' (Get Me Poison), ''Bairini Bala'' (Trouble of Wife).  During this time, Firoze Antia, Madhukar Randeria, Anjani Desai, Shankarprasad Desai, Devyani Desai, Vrajlal Parekh, Vanlata Mehta, Nilanjana Mehta and Niharika Divetia became associated with the INT. The INT celebrated the centenary of [[Gujarati theatre]] later that year with plays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other notable productions included ''Dekh teri Bambai'', Gujarati plays''Jesal Toral'', ''Moti Verana Chowkma'' (Pearls Scattered in the Yard), and ''Santu Rangeeli'' (Enchanting Santu), and [[Marathi theatre|Marathi play]]s ''Batatyachi Chal'' (Potato Chawl) by [[P. L. Deshpande]] as well as ''Kanyadan'' and ''Kondu'' by [[Vijay Tendulkar]]. The INT also produced Gujarati children's plays on ''Chhako Mako'' and ''[[Bakor Patel]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The English productions department of the INT produced [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[The Sacred Flame (play)|The Sacred Flame]]'' directed by [[Adi Pherozeshah Marzban|Adi Marzban]] as well as several other plays.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From 1950 to 1960, the INT organised [[Garba (dance)|Rasgarba]] competitions, which started a tradition of folk performances from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashta]] and [[Gujarat]] in Mumbai. The theatre also organised the All India Folk-dance Festival in 1955 and since 1974, has been organising Intercollege Theatre Competitions (later in an association with ''[[Gujarat Samachar]]'').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Contemporary activities==
The INT produces commercial, art, and folk theatre, does research on folk theatre, and trains actors and directors, and has built facilities in Gujarat and Maharashtra for these activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[impresario]] department of the INT performs plays overseas in collaboration with the Indian Council of Cultural Relations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The INT performs throughout India in theatres as well as nontraditional venues, and uses no scenery. Productions focus on issues of [[social justice]], and rely on [[pantomime]] and dialogue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/theater-building/Developments-in-Asia#ref463838|title=Theatre – Developments in Asia|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical physics, '''inversion transformations''' are a natural extension of [[Poincaré transformation]]s to include all [[conformal map|conformal]] [[bijection|one-to-one]] transformations on coordinate [[space-time]]. They are less studied in physics because unlike the rotations and translations of Poincaré symmetry an object cannot be physically transformed by the inversion symmetry. Some physical theories are invariant under this symmetry, in these cases it is what is known as a 'hidden symmetry'. Other hidden symmetries of physics include [[gauge symmetry]] and [[general covariance]].

==Early use==
In 1831 the mathematician [[Ludwig Immanuel Magnus]] began to publish on transformations of the plane generated by inversion in a circle of radius ''R''. His work initiated a large body of publications, now called [[inversive geometry]]. The most prominently named mathematician became [[August Ferdinand Möbius]] once he reduced the planar transformations to [[complex number]] arithmetic. In the company of physicists employing the inversion transformation early on was [[Lord Kelvin]], and the association with him leads it to be called the [[Kelvin transform]].

==Transformation on coordinates==
In the following we shall use imaginary time (&lt;math&gt;t'=it&lt;/math&gt;) so that space-time is Euclidean and the equations are simpler. The Poincaré transformations are given by the coordinate transformation on space-time parametrized by the 4-vectors&amp;nbsp;''V''

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime = O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\mu \,  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an [[orthogonal matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-vector. Applying this transformation twice on a [[4-vector]] gives a third transformation of the same form. The basic invariant under this transformation is the space-time length given by the distance between two [[space-time]] points given by 4-vectors ''x'' and&amp;nbsp;''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;r = |x - y |. \, &lt;/math&gt;

These transformations are subgroups of general 1-1 conformal transformations on space-time. It is possible to extend these transformations to include all 1-1 conformal transformations on [[space-time]]

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( A_\tau ^\nu V_\nu +B_\tau \right) \left( C_{\tau \mu
}^\nu V_\nu +D_{\tau \mu }\right) ^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

We must also have an equivalent condition to the orthogonality condition of the Poincaré transformations:

:&lt;math&gt;AA^T+BC=DD^T+CB \, &lt;/math&gt;

Because one can divide the top and bottom of the transformation by &lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; we lose no generality by setting &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to the unit matrix. We end up with

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mu ^\prime =\left( O_\mu ^\nu V_\nu +P_\tau \right) \left( \delta _{\tau
\mu} + Q_{\tau \mu }^\nu V_\nu \right) ^{-1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Applying this transformation twice on a 4-vector gives a transformation of the same form. The new symmetry of 'inversion' is given by the 3-tensor &lt;math&gt;Q.&lt;/math&gt; This symmetry becomes Poincaré symmetry if we set &lt;math&gt;Q=0.&lt;/math&gt; When &lt;math&gt;Q=0&lt;/math&gt; the second condition requires that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal matrix. This transformation is 1-1 meaning that each point is mapped to a unique point only if we theoretically include the points at infinity.

==Invariants==
The invariants for this symmetry in 4 dimensions is unknown however it is known that the invariant requires a minimum of 4 space-time points. In one dimension, the invariant is the well known [[cross-ratio]] from [[Möbius transformation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-X)(y-Y)}{(x-Y)(y-X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the only invariants under this symmetry involve a minimum of 4 points, this symmetry cannot be a symmetry of point particle theory. Point particle theory relies on knowing the lengths of paths of particles through space-time (e.g., from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;). The symmetry can be a symmetry of a [[string theory]] in which the strings are uniquely determined by their endpoints. The [[propagator]] for this theory for a string starting at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(x,X)&lt;/math&gt; and ending at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;(y,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a conformal function of the 4-dimensional invariant. A string field in endpoint-string theory is a function over the endpoints.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x,X). \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Physical evidence==
Although it is natural to generalize the Poincaré transformations in order to find hidden [[symmetries]] in physics and thus narrow down the number of possible theories of [[high-energy physics]], it is difficult to experimentally examine this symmetry as it is not possible to transform an object under this symmetry. The indirect evidence of this symmetry is given by how accurately fundamental theories of physics that are invariant under this symmetry make predictions. Other indirect evidence is whether theories that are invariant under this symmetry lead to contradictions such as giving probabilities greater than 1. So far there has been no direct evidence that the fundamental constituents of the Universe are strings. The symmetry could also be a [[broken symmetry]] meaning that although it is a symmetry of physics, the Universe has 'frozen out' in one particular direction so this symmetry is no longer evident.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">While many [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Jihadism|jihadists]] view [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] negatively, due to its Western origins, there have also been examples of [[Middle Eastern hip hop|hip-hop songs]] [[Political hip hop|with]] pro-jihadist lyrics, and of jihadists embracing hip-hop and [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] culture as a way of attracting Westerners to join their organizations. The phenomenon is sometimes known as "[[Jihad Cool]]" and includes music, clothing, magazine, videos and other media.

==Notable examples==
German rapper [[Deso Dogg]] later took the names Abu Talha al-Almani&lt;ref name="tahroor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/25/the-strange-role-of-rappers-in-the-islamic-states-jihad/|title=The strange role of rappers in the Islamic State’s jihad|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Ishaan |last=Tharoor|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Abou Maleeq, and joined ISIL in 2014.

British-born [[Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary]] rapped under the name L Jinny, is the son of Egyptian militant [[Adel Abdel Bari]], and was reportedly videotaped beheading journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]. Jinny once [[Twitter|Tweeted]] a photo of himself holding a man's severed head, with the words "Chillin' with my [[homie]] or what's left of him."&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt; These rappers, in turn, have inspired other jihadist activities; one young Kosovar was reportedly inspired by Deso Dogg's lyrics to fire at an American military bus in [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Douglas McCain]] was an aspiring rapper and basketball player who was killed while fighting for ISIL in 2014. His classmates described him as a "goofball" who "got along with most", while a coworker referred to him as a "normal guy".&lt;ref name="McCain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/08/27/douglas-mcauthur-mccain-basketball-player-rapper-islamic-state-fighter|title=American Killed Fighting for Islamic State|first=Andrew |last=Soergel|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL, in particular, has used social media in attempts to reach young people, many of whom do not necessarily have any Muslim background at all. Two young British jihadists who travelled to Syria to join ISIL reportedly learned everything they knew about Islam from reading the book ''Islam for Dummies''. As a result, many of recruits are believed not to be motivated by Islam as such, but rather by a combination of anger (either feeling oppressed themselves, or wanting to fight on behalf of the oppressed) and the desire for fame and glory. They end up turning to ISIL and jihadism as an outlet for these feelings.&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt;

==Analysis==
Anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] argues that the phenomenon results from a search for "sacred values" and what [[Edmund Burke]] called "the sublime"; a "quest for greatness, glory, eternal meaning in an inherently chaotic world".&lt;ref name="dickey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/25/isis-hip-hop-jihadists-and-the-man-who-killed-james-foley.html|title=ISIS, Hip-Hop Jihadists and the Man Who Killed James Foley|first=Christopher|last=Dickey|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Khan has cited Douglas McCain as yet another example of this phenomenon, and said that both Islamism and gangsta rap foster a "sense of grievance towards wider society" and "focus on vengeance and fetishize violence as a way of redressing the balance". Khan says that while researching young Islamists in London, he found that they looked to the works of [[50 Cent]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] for inspiration. Khan argues that what sets ISIL apart from other jihadist groups, and makes it far more dangerous as a result, is its ability to harness hip-hop to "bestow on its struggle a counter-culture sense of subversive 'cool' that mainstream political parties and even commercial brands might envy." ISIL's marketing methods and overall strategies are also reminiscent of those used by street gangs.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/al-qaedas-new-front-jihadi-rap-110481_Page2.html#.VAZjoJUg-Uk|title=Al Qaeda’s New Front: Jihadi Rap|first=Amil|last=Kahn|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hisham Aidi has written a book, ''Rebel Music: Race, Empire, and the New Muslim Youth Culture'' describing the phenomenon of Islamist hip-hop, but Aidi also mentions that the United States and other Western governments have attempted to use hip-hop and [[Sufi music]] to ''fight'' terrorism by deradicalizing young Muslims.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} One American rapper, [[Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki|Omar Hamaami]], who later joined [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], released a song with the lyrics "Bomb by bomb, blast by blast, only going to bring back the glorious past."&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/9_disturbingly_good_jihadi_raps|title=9 Disturbingly Good Jihadi Raps|first=J. Dana|last=Stuster|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of jihadi rap has been around since at least 2004, when the song "[[Dirty Kuffar]]" was released. In 2006, [[Aki Nawaz]] of the group [[Fun-Da-Mental]] released an album with lyrics comparing [[Osama bin Laden]] to [[Che Guevara]] and depicting the [[Statue of Liberty]] as an [[abu Ghraib prison]]er.&lt;ref name="cicero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciceromagazine.com/features/is-extremist-hip-hop-helping-isis/|title=Is Extremist Hip Hop Helping ISIS?|first=Hisham |last=Aidi|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Cicero (magazine)|Cicero]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It presents annually an array of culturally diverse festivals, concert series and educational programs that focus on, but are not limited to, American music in all of its forms and variations.

==History==
The Shedd Institute was founded in 1991 under the name [[Oregon Festival of American Music]] as a thematically based summer orchestral pops festival dedicated to the championship of American classical music. In 1993 the Festival was designated as a Resident Company of the [[Hult Center for the Performing Arts]]. It established a community music institute in 1995.

In 1997 the company shifted radically from its summer-only festival model and began year-round programming with the foundation of two additional performance initiatives, The American Symphonia and The Emerald City Jazz Kings. The American Symphonia, which was under the artistic direction of conductor [[James Paul]] from 1997–2006, was a classical music initiative dedicated specifically to the championship of post-1900 European art music written in the Western Hemisphere. The Emerald City Jazz Kings, founded and directed by trombonist and music scholar Stephen Stone, is a 16 to 22 member ensemble dedicated to the presentation of American popular music from the 1920s through '50s, with an emphasis on big band jazz, swing, musical theater, and the American standard. In 1998 the company's eclectic August festival named jazz pianist and composer [[Dick Hyman]] as its jazz advisor, who joined James Paul at its artistic helm.

By 1999 the Festival had added 2 more performance initiatives to its programming (its Now Hear This Presenting Series and the Twin Rivers Folklife Festival) and, with the continued expansion of its community music school, had begun a search for a building of its own. In July 2002 it moved into the former First Baptist Church in downtown Eugene (a {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} complex of performance, meeting and classroom spaces), which it named "The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts" in honor of early 20th century Chicago businessman and philanthropist [[John G. Shedd]], the great-grandfather of Festival co-founder and long-time patron and Director of Education, Ginevra Reed Ralph.

In 2004 the Festival official changed its name to the name of its building. It is commonly referred to as "The Shedd Institute" while the building is known simply as "The Shedd". It added 2 additional concert initiatives to its cultural service mix (The Magical Moombah, a musical vaudeville for kids directed by Judith "Sparky" Roberts, and its Shedd Presents series) and began rental of the facility to other regional, cultural and educational programs.

==Performance programs==
The Shedd Institute's performance division currently manages 5 concert series: [[Oregon Festival of American Music]] (an August Festival, founded in 1992, dedicated to the classic American Songbook),  The Emerald City Jazz Kings (founded in 1997, the Institute's resident jazz and historic popular music ensemble), Shedd Theatricals (founded in 2002 to produce classical musicals and musical comedies from the 1920s to early 1960s), The Magical Moombah (founded in 2001), the Now Hear This cultural presenting series (founded in 2000), and Shedd Presents (founded in 2004).

==Facilities==
The Shedd Institute's facility is located on the corner of Broadway &amp; High Street in downtown Eugene. Formerly, the building housed the First Baptist Church of Eugene.  A {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building has 2 formal concert halls (the 825-seat Jaqua Concert Hall and the 175-seat Recital Hall), a multi-purpose 250-seat Great Hall, 2 dance studios, a library, and over 30 other community meeting rooms, classrooms and rehearsal spaces.

===Historic properties===
[[File:Glen Leven Home.jpg|thumb|Historic Glen Leven Home in Davidson County, just six miles from downtown Nashville, Tenn.]]
In 2010, protection of historic properties earned the Land Trust for Tennessee an honor award from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/training/awards/2010-national-preservation-awards/the-land-trust-for-tennessee.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.VWSH0hPF_UI |title=The Land Trust for Tennessee - Preservation Leadership Forum |publisher=Preservationnation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Trust protects multiple properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], Tennessee Century Farms, sites with critical American Indian history, and significant [[American Civil War|Civil War]] properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/civil-war-sites/ |title=Civil War Sites &amp;#124; The Land Trust for Tennessee |publisher=Landtrusttn.org |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landtrusttn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2014-Conservation-Snapshot.pdf|title=2014 Conservation Snapshot|publisher=Landtrusttn.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonps.org/shys-hill/|title=Shy's Hill {{!}} Battle of Nashville Preservation Society, Inc.|website=www.bonps.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sites in Franklin, Nashville, Thompson's Station and New Johnsonville and Rippavilla Plantation in Spring Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://springhillhomepage.com/historic-rippavilla-plantation-is-granted-conservation-easement/|title=Historic Rippavilla Plantation now protected - Spring Hill Home Page|website=springhillhomepage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Trust works to preserve the community character of Tennessee towns through projects such as the protection of the scenic gateways in the [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] community of Williamson County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwoodhomepage.com/aubrey-preston-works-to-preserve-leipers-forks-charm-cms-16190#.VaLcx_kUHVY/ |title=Aubrey Preston works to preserve Leiper's Fork's charm |publisher=Brentwood Home Page |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban open space===
In 2011, The Land Trust for Tennessee partnered with [[Karl Dean|The Office of the Mayor]] and [[The Conservation Fund]] to spearhead Nashville: Naturally, a plan that catalogues protected open space in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] and charts the course for how to protect and connect this green infrastructure. Key land protection resulting from the plan includes: the acquisition of the former Cornelia Fort Airpark for the Shelby Bottoms Greenway and Nature Park in East Nashville; a 568-acre expansion of Beaman Park; and the 780-acre property acquisition along the Stones River in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/08/14/open-space-plan-makes-nashville-conservation-leader/31700459/|title=Open Space Plan makes Nashville conservation leader|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife habitat===
The Land Trust for Tennessee has completed multiple conservation projects focused on protecting wildlife habitat within farms, forests, parks, riparian corridors and wetlands. The Land Trust provides resources and educates owners of Land Trust-protected land about best practices to restore, maintain and enhance wildlife habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/157274/twra-land-trust-for-tennessee-seek-68-acres-for-wildlife-refuge/ |title=TWRA, Land Trust for Tennessee seek 68 acres for wildlife refuge |publisher=Nooga.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, The Land Trust partnered with The University of the South to protect 3,000 acres of land containing portions of Lost and Champion Coves to protect wildlife habitat. This project links together large, protected tracts, including Franklin State Forest, two State Natural Areas, Buggy Top Cave and Natural Bridge, creating and conserving large-scale wildlife corridors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In 2012, The Land Trust partnered with [[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency]] to protect migratory land for 48,000 [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Cranes]] on a significant point on [[Trail of Tears|The Trail of Tears]] along [[Blythe Ferry]] Road in Meigs County, Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2015/sep/09/east-green-tennessee/323936/|title='Eat Green' event benefits state land preservation, including farms|date=2017-05-10|work=timesfreepress.com|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, The Land Trust for Tennessee and its partners, including The Conservation Fund, protected 4,061 acres of forest in Sherwood, located in Franklin and Marion counties, that includes habitat for the federally threatened [[Painted snake-coiled forest snail|painted snake coiled forest snails]] and other state-listed species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Watershed protection===
The Land Trust conserves lands that border rivers, lakes and streams to create natural buffers that filter pollution to protect both groundwater and surface water quality for human and wildlife health. The Land Trust protects more than 10,000 acres within the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]] Watershed, one of the most biologically diverse inland freshwater ecosystem in North America, and land within other focal watersheds, including the Harpeth, Red, Buffalo, Watauga and Hiwassee Rivers and Oostanaula Creek.

==Strategies for land protection==
The majority of The Land Trust for Tennessee's conservation projects are completed by donated [[conservation easement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through these legal agreements, private or public landowners continue to own their property, and limitations are placed on future development to protect conservation values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some cases, The Land Trust for Tennessee works to acquire potential parkland and wildlife habitat to transfer to government entities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Land Trust often assists in securing private dollars and works with other conservation partners to supplement state and federal resources. In other cases, The Land Trust for Tennessee also protects land through purchased conservation easements, land donations, bargain sale arrangements, and land purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.landtrusttn.org/about|title=About Us - The Land Trust for Tennessee|work=The Land Trust for Tennessee|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glen Leven Farm ==
The Land Trust owns and maintains Glen Leven Farm, a 65-acre working farm just four miles from the center of Nashville that includes a Greek Revival home built in 1857. In late 2006, the historic home and farm were left to the Land Trust by the late Susan M. West, a descendant of Thomas Thompson who acquired 647 acres through a Revolutionary Land Grant in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tommythompsonart.com/blog/23820/legendary-matriarch-of-glen-leven-mansion-smiles-down-on-historic-home/|title=Legendary Matriarch of Glen Leven Mansion Smiles Down on Historic Home &amp;#124; Tommy Thompson - Blog|date=1970-01-01|publisher=Tommythompsonart.com|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Leven Farm sustains multiple community partnerships. Double H Farms – The Hermitage Hotel's Sustainable Farming Project maintains an heirloom garden at Glen Leven Farm to grow food for [[The Hermitage Hotel]]'s Capitol Grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2013/12/18/6311813/nashville-chef-tyler-brown-on-farming-partnerships-and-creating-a|title=Nashville Chef Tyler Brown on Farming, Partnerships, and Creating a Beef Label|date=2013-12-18|website=Eater|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackalope Brewery of Nashville, Tenn. grows hops on a section of the farm for a seasonal brew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/food-drink/article/13061774/celebrate-halloween-and-the-harvest-at-glen-leven-farm|title=Celebrate Halloween and the Harvest at Glen Leven Farm|work=Nashville Scene|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer Beekeeper Matt Slocum maintains a honey bee sanctuary on the farm.

In 2012, the arboretum at Glen Leven Farm was established through the Nashville Tree Foundation and includes the largest mass of American Yellowwood in the United States, a White Ash, a Basswood, an American Ash, a Dogwood, a Ginkgo, a Black Walnut, a Sugar Maple, a Chinkapin Oak, a Laurel Oak, a Pecan, a Hedge Maple and a massive Trifoliate Orange tree – all winners of the Nashville Tree Foundation's Big Old Tree Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nashvilletreefoundation.org/big-old-tree-contest-previous-winners-species|title=Big Old Tree Contest Species|website=Nashville Tree Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen Leven Farm also hosts educational programs such as the Land Trust's "Nature's Classroom Field Trip Program" for school groups. The program meets state curriculum standards and exposes students to a natural, historic and agricultural landscape, providing an enriched learning experience outside of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landtrusttn.org/glen-leven/|title=Glen Leven Farm &amp;#124; The Land Trust for Tennessee|date=|publisher=Landtrusttn.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Kids-and-Nature/Why-Get-Kids-Outside/Health-Benefits.aspx|title=Health Benefits - National Wildlife Federation|date=|publisher=Nwf.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization hosts group tours and community open days at Glen Leven Farm, but the property is not to regularly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://landtrusttn.org/nationalhoneybeeday/|title=National Honey Bee Day Celebration at Glen Leven Farm - The Land Trust for Tennessee|date=2016-08-25|work=The Land Trust for Tennessee|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Foundation The Land Trust for Tennessee==
===Formation and First Projects===
The Land Trust for Tennessee was co-founded in 1999 by Jean C. Nelson (former general counsel to the Environmental Protection Agency), [[Phil Bredesen]] (Mayor of Nashville-Davidson County 1991-1999; Governor of Tennessee 2003-2011), and a group of 12 founding individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://franklinhomepage.com/leipers-fork-woman-named-second-ceo-of-the-land-trust-for-tennessee/|title=Leiper's Fork woman named second CEO of The Land Trust for Tennessee - Franklin Home Page|website=franklinhomepage.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Trust for Tennessee's first project was a conservation easement donated by Aubrey Preston in December 1999 on his farm in Leiper's Fork in Williamson County, one of the 50 fastest growing U.S. counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitleipersfork.com/news |title=Events &amp;#124; Historic Leiper's Fork Village |publisher=Visitleipersfork.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/real-estate/2015/06/30/justin-timberlake-pays-williamson-county-land/29519153/|title=Justin Timberlake pays $4M for Williamson County land|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">This is a list of botanical illustrators and flower painters born in or citizens of the [[United States of America]]. It does not include European botanical illustrators active in America during the Colonial period; for information on these, see the main entry on [[botanical illustrator]]s.

Botanical illustrators paint or draw plants and sometimes their natural environment as well, forming a lineage where art and science meet. Some prefer to paint isolated specimen flowers while others prefer arrangements. Many botanical artists through the centuries have been active in collecting and cataloguing new species and/or in breeding plants. Some artists listed here worked primarily on botanical art, while others made it part of a wider artistic practice or illustrated books with their artwork.

[[File:Theresa May supports Little Miss Geek.jpg|thumb|upright|British MP and Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] supporting the Little Miss Geek campaign in 2013]]
For 2013 [[Ada Lovelace]] Day, Little Miss Geek created a campaign to put the 'Her In Hero'. Saying that 'Brilliant successful women in technology exist, but they are not celebrated in the same way their male counterparts are', the campaign urged schools and MPs to celebrate great female technologists, scientists and inventors to inspire girls with brilliant role models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlemissgeek.com/her-in-hero |title=HER In Hero initiative |publisher=Little Miss Geek |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign took place at over 15 schools across the UK, reaching out to over 10,000 students and gaining the support of over 40 MPs including Ms Jo Swinson MP, Hon Ed Vaizey MP, and Rt Hon Theresa May MP. The campaign received media coverage across Metro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Metro|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/15/ada-lovelace-day-a-celebration-of-the-worlds-first-computer-programmer-4145367/|title=Ada Lovelace Day: A celebration of the world’s first computer programmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/15/women-technology-science-careers-her-in-hero|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013-10-15|title=Putting the HER in Hero: why we need more tech superwomen|author=Belinda Parmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event was held on the morning of Ada Lovelace Day at [[Highgate Wood School]], featuring a talk from Siobhan Reddy of [[Media Molecule]] on her experiences with the games industry and how she got into it.

== School Takeovers ==

On 8 March 2013 ([[International Women's Day]]) Little Miss Geek ran the ‘Little Miss Geek ICT School Takeover’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=__start__ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXDNJxmjgk |title=Little Miss Geek ICT School Takeover 8.3.13 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at two schools in London: [[Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls]] and [[St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School]]. MP [[Simon Hughes]] attended the session and [[Boris Johnson]] who commented on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=549636098400679&amp;set=a.159024880795138.32635.124879530876340&amp;type=1&amp;theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=549636098400679&amp;set=a.159024880795138.32635.124879530876340&amp;type=1&amp;theater |title=Tijdlijnfoto's |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events made use of [[Raspberry Pi]] computers in order to give girls actual software development experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/interview--the-computer-which-is-teaching-british-children-to-code-154220241.html |title=Interview: The £25 computer which is teaching British children to code - Yahoo! News UK |publisher=Uk.news.yahoo.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and address the gender imbalance in the technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gothinkbig.co.uk/features/gadgets-arent-just-for-guys-ladygeek-want-girls-to-get-gaming/ |title=LadyGeek want girls to get gaming |publisher=Gothinkbig.co.uk |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Parmar, the Takeover events were intended to address an image problem: "girls think that people who work in technology are pizza-loving nerds who can't get girlfriends. The reality is technology is one of the most creative industries out there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1062240/girl-gamers-transform-pizza-loving-nerd-image |title=Girl Gamers Transform 'Pizza-Loving Nerd' Image |publisher=News.sky.com |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Girls are] dreaming of using the iPad mini and the latest smart-phone, but they’re not dreaming of creating it,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/technology/computer-coding-its-not-just-for-boys.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|title=Computer Coding: It's Not Just for Boys|author=Beth Gardiner|date=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmar is a critic of British technology education. She states: "The education system should be the place where we convert childhood experiences with technology into an understanding about computing, where we lay the groundwork for a child to push on into adulthood with not only an interest in tech, but also the skills to start competing in the industry. As it is, however, we are failing our youngsters.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2013/03/07/little-miss-geek-campaign-offers-tech-inspiration-for-girls/ |title=Little Miss Geek Campaign Offers Tech Inspiration for Girls |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2013-06-07 |first=Andy |last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Merlin''''' is a partially [[Lost work|lost]] [[epic poem]] of the [[Arthurian legend]] in which the French knight-poet [[Robert de Boron]] reworked [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s material about the legendary figure of [[Merlin]], writing in [[Old French]] sometime in either the late 12th&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; or early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arthurian-legend#ref266096|title=Arthurian legend|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Robert's other works, ''Joseph'' and ''Perceval'', ''Merlin'' forms a trilogy centered around the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;

''Merlin'' tells the stories of the origin and early life of Merlin, his role in the birth of [[King Arthur|Arthur]], and how Arthur became the king of Britain. It introduced a number of new motifs that later became popular in medieval and later Arthurian literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2a22CNzigcAC&amp;pg=PA99|title=Heroes and Anti-heroes in Medieval Romance|first=Neil|last=Cartlidge|publisher=DS Brewer|via=Google Books|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also ensuring the lasting place of Merlin as a key character in the story of King Arthur.&lt;ref name=lit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXoqDwAAQBAJ|title=The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain|first1=Sian|last1=Echard|first2=Robert|last2=Rouse|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's medieval [[prose]] retelling and its continuations were also incorporated into the French [[chivalric romance]]s during the early 13th century, collectively known as the Prose ''Merlin''.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/conlee-prose-merlin-introduction|title=Prose Merlin: Introduction |publisher=Robbins Library Digital Projects|website=d.lib.rochester.edu|author=John Conlee|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poem==
Writing ''Merlin'' (c. 1195-1210&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;), [[Robert de Boron]] was inspired by [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'',&lt;ref name=grail&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgjs3WVBKJkC&amp;pg=PR25|title=The History of the Holy Grail|first=Norris J.|last=Lacy|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|via=Google Books|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new/&gt; an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] adaptation of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. The poem is an [[Allegory|allegorical]] tale, relating to the figure and works of [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/romance-literature-and-performance/Medieval-prose-romances#ref503738|title=Medieval prose romances - literature and performance|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of Robert's works, [[Merlin]]'s part and role in the Arthurian legend becomes much greater than in previous texts, especially when compared to only one minor appearance among all five (and also influential) Arthurian works of [[Chrétien de Troyes]].&lt;ref name=lit/&gt; Robert emphasises on Merlin's power to [[prophesy]] along with many instances of [[shapeshift]]ing, as well as on his connection to the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6YECwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40|title=The Holy Grail: From antiquity to the present day|first=Giles|last=Morgan|publisher=Oldcastle Books|via=Google Books|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 504 lines of ''Merlin'' in its original poem form have survived to this day, but its contents are known from the [[prose]] version.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hf6zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA373|title=The New Arthurian Encyclopedia: New Edition (Page 373)|first=Norris J.|last=Lacy|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Merlin (illustration from middle ages).jpg|thumb|Merlin dictates the story of Arthur and his knights for Blase to write down in a 13th-century illustration for the prose version, ''Estoire de Merlin'']]

The first part of the text introduces the character of Blase, a cleric and clerk who is pictured as writing down Merlin's deeds, explaining how they came to be known and preserved. In Robert's account, as in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', Merlin is begotten by an [[incubus]] demon on a virgin as an intended [[Antichrist]]. This plot is thwarted when the expectant mother informs her confessor, Blase, of her predicament; they immediately baptize the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny. The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives him a [[prophet]]ic knowledge of the future.

The story of ''Merlin'' is related to Robert de Boron's two other poems that also feature Merlin as an integral character.&lt;ref name=lit/&gt; First recast into prose c. 1210, the three poems (''Joseph'', ''Merlin'', and ''Perceval'') can also form the trilogy known as ''Le Roman du Graal'',&lt;ref name=grail/&gt; which tells the story of the Arthurian myth as completely rewritten for the Holy Grail: brought from the [[Middle East]] to Britain by followers of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], the Grail is eventually recovered by Arthur's knight [[Percival]] as foretold in one of the prophecies in ''Merlin''.&lt;ref name=lit/&gt;

===Synopsis===
:Note: All names and events as in the later [[Middle English]] prose version (see below).

''Merlin'' begins with the scene of a council of demons plotting to create the future Merlin as their agent on Earth to undo the work of Christ, but their plan is foiled and the mother names the child Merlin after her father. It continues with the story of the usurper king Vortiger ([[Vortigern]]) and his tower, featuring the seven-year-old Merlin with amazing prophetic powers. Following Vortiger's death, which Merlin also predicted, he assists the new king Pendragon and his brother Uter ([[Uther Pendragon]], soon himself the king as Uterpendragon after the death of the original Pendragon at [[Salisbury]]) in their bloody war against [[Saxons|Saxon]] invaders, later erecting [[Stonehenge]] as burial place for the fallen Britons and eventually inspiring the creation of the [[Round Table]].

This is followed by the account of Uter's war with the Duke of [[Tintagel]] (here unnamed, [[Gorlois]] in general Arthurian tradition) for the latter's wife Ygerne ([[Igraine]]), during which Merlin's magic enables Uter to sleep with Ygerne and conceive [[King Arthur|Arthur]], destined to become the [[Emperor of Rome]]. After Uter kills his rival and forcibly marries Ygerne, the newborn Arthur is given into the foster care of Antor ([[Sir Ector|Ector]]), while Ygerne's daughters from the previous marriage are wed to [[King Lot]] and King Ventres ([[Budic II of Brittany|Nentres]]), and her illegitimate daughter Morgan is sent away to a nunnery and becomes known as [[Morgan le Fay]] (the first account of Morgan being Igraine's daughter and learning magic in a convent&lt;ref name="Larrington, p. 41"&gt;Carolyne Larrington, ''King Arthur's Enchantresses'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The poem seems to have ended with the later [[Excalibur|"sword in the stone" story]], in which Arthur proves he is to become Britain's high king by a divine destiny. This has been the first instance of this motif to appear in Arthurian literature; it has become iconic after being repeated almost exact in [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s popular ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; {{clear}}

==Prose and continuations==
The poem was rewritten in prose and extended with a lengthy sequel to become the early-13th-century romance ''Estoire de Merlin'' (''History of Merlin''), also known as the Vulgate ''Merlin'' or Prose ''Merlin'', by authors unknown (highly possibly a single author,&lt;ref name=cycle/&gt; perhaps Robert himself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/arthur/expo_uk/salle2/05.htm|title=BnF - The legend of King Arthur|website=expositions.bnf.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Estoire de Merlin'' constitutes one of the five volumes of the [[Vulgate Cycle]] / Lancelot-Grail as a probably late addition to it.&lt;ref name=cycle/&gt; The later [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] also begins with material drawn from the poem.&lt;ref name=new2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hf6zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435|title=The New Arthurian Encyclopedia: New Edition (Page 435)|first=Norris J.|last=Lacy|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the two sequels to ''Merlin'' are known as the Vulgate ''Suite du Merlin'', a 'historical' sequel about the various wars of Arthur and the role of Merlin in them, also focusing on [[Gawain]] as the third main character.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; The second is the later ''Suite du Merlin'' (or a ''Merlin Continuation''), also known as the ''Suite-Huth'' or ''Huth Merlin''; a 'romantic' sequel.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref name=cycle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkBSujrlYRAC&amp;pg=PA13|title=A Companion to the Lancelot-Grail Cycle|first=Carol|last=Dover|publisher=DS Brewer|via=Google Books|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the ''Suite du Merlin'' is best known as the primary source of Malory for the first four books of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'';&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=new2/&gt; the previous Vulgate ''Suite'' also served as a minor source for Malory's Roman War episode (Book II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maloryproject.com/vulgatemerlin_intro.php|title=Malory Project - Vulgatemerlin Intro|website=www.maloryproject.com|author=Zoë Enstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior English translations and adaptations have included [[Henry Lovelich]]'s poem ''Merlin'', the romance ''Of Arthour and of Merlin'' (also known as just ''Arthour and Merlin''), and the poem [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']].

The following is the mid-15th-century English translation, with [[Modern English|modern]] conventions for punctuation and capitalization, of the poem's prose version (also reworked into the romance ''Arthour and Merlin''),&lt;ref name=new/&gt; sans the sequels:

'''Winzavod''' ({{lang-ru|Винзавод}}; ''Vinzavod'', literally [[winery]]) is a [[arts centre|centre]] for [[contemporary art]]s in [[Moscow, Russia]]. &lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.winzavod.ru/about/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.winzavod.ru/about/history.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
Opened in 2007, it is located in a complex of seven industrial buildings from the late 19th century including the former [[brewery]] (and later winery) called "Moscow Bavaria". Alexander Brodsky is the coordinator of the project.

==Estate of Princess Volkonskaya==

Captain of the Guards regiment Mel’gunov, the first owner of a large estate situated in modern Mruzovskomu on the corner 4th streets BANKS, sold his estate to his own sister, Princess Catherine Volkonskaya. She was an outstanding Moscow lady and mistress of the Sukhanov Moscow region, and she had the nickname "Aunt Warrior" for her decisive power over her nephew, Peter Volkonsky, the Chief of Staff of Kutuzov. Oddly enough, many decorations of the building survived, and the house itself has not changed in appearance. Destroyed a century ago, the terrace is now restored. The building stands to the right of the entrance to Winzavod, a strong and solid center of the isolated beautiful portico, and in front there is an unusual semi-circular section.

In 1805, Monin bought the manor. After four years in 1810, Nicephorus Prokofiev opened a malt-brewing factory on its territory. In early 1821, the estate passed on to Revel shopkeeper Frederick Danielson of the 2nd Guild, who added a wing to the residential part of the building, along with a two-story brewery and malt house. Long malt warehouses lined the other side of the lane. It is still possible to see the intricately intertwined initials, surrounded by a lush ornamentation of his son Ludwig Fridrikhovich in the tympanum of the portico of the main house. The garden façade focuses on elegant empire-style décor.

In the 1840s, the factory, which now belonged to merchants of the first guild William Watson and Peter Dreier, was the second largest in Moscow, after "Trekhgorny".  It brewed 57,000 rubles worth of beer each year. In 1855, this huge mansion and factory were owned by the famous "buy-em-up king" Vasily Aleksandrovich Kokorev. He made a fortune on wine sales, was involved in banking, was one of the pioneers of the Russian oil industry, founded several industrial companies and became one of the richest men in Russia. 

Kokorev collected paintings and was a patron of the arts: in the gallery, which he established in 1861, he placed more than 500 paintings, including paintings of Briullov, Levitsky, Borovikovsky Kiprensky. P. M. Tretyakov purchased some of them after the owner went bankrupt.  For a while there was a factory here of wax, resins and stoppers (plugs/corks), belonging to N. F. Mamontov, which in 1858 was moved to its own premises near the Presnenskaya outpost, where it launched production of varnishes.

==Moscow Bavaria==

In the middle of the 19th century, the western part of the estate was cut off by the Moscow-Kursk railway. The malt building was on the corner of the newly paved lane and unexpectedly increased in urban value. The brewery kept all of its buildings. In the 1870s through the 1880s, brothers Ivan and Cyril Tarusin, the owners of “Moscow Bavaria” (Russian company for beer and mead in Moscow), acquired the factory.  The plant was equipped with three steam engines with the total capacity of 45 horsepower, serviced 70 workers, and released a premium beer "Vienna Pure Number 1" for the price of 1 ruble and 60 kopecks per cask. The beverage "Black Velvet" was also famous. 

In 1909, part of the estate was acquired by legal representatives of the honorable H. S. Ledentsov, who used his resources for educational purposes; the main house was converted into a four-year college. By this time, the ancient manor had been significantly reduced in size: part of it was cut off by the rail line, and one part, which was given to Yauza, was sold to others. I. P. Goloulin was the head of the houses, and for many years the house was locally named Goloulinskii, and even all the area up to the waterfront Yauza was called Goloulinka.

Across Hludovsky Lane (now BANKS travel, 6), there is a complex of charities associated with the name Gerasim Ivanovich Khludov. Egorievskii peasants, the Khludovs were weaving-artisans; the whole family was set apart in intelligence, enterprise, shrewdness, and hard work. After the death of the founder Ivan Ivanovich, his sons received 200 thousand rubles, which they used to expand production. Soon they were able to start trading in Moscow, and in 1847 they began construction of a cotton mill in Egoryevsk, which became one of the largest cotton mills in the suburbs of Moscow.

Together with his brother Alexei Gerasim, Khludov handled the manufacturing and became one of the richest men in Russia. In 1865, Khludov established an office in Liverpool where he could buy raw materials and steam engines, which lasted for more than forty years. In 1874, they organized the "Partnership on Equal Footing" with a capital of 3 million rubles, and the owners themselves and their families were the only shareholders. The workday at the factory lasted 14 hours for adults and nine hours for children. M. E. Saltykov-Shchedrin dealt with the matter of lawlessness in the factory in the late fifties however, despite their work practices the Khludovs were also known as benefactors and patrons. Like Kokorev, Gerasim Khludov collected paintings by Perov, Aivazovsky, and Briullov; the painting “Fussy Bride” of Fedotov was found in his collection. 

After the early death of his only son Paul, Khludov donated several hundred thousand rubles and specifically bought a huge plot of land in Syromyatniki for the construction of a charity-house to care for the poor. After Khludov’s death in 1885, the Merchant Society, with the money that Khludov left them, began construction on a large home-shelter with a church, designed by architect BV Freidenberg. It was opened on May 8, 1888. At that time 50 women and 30 men were placed there, and 150 widows and orphans were placed in 87 free apartments (flats).

Khludov’s daughters were also involved in building the charity Syromyatnikov; Alexandera Naydenova donated funds to build free housing apartments, Lyubov Vostryakova donated funds for free public school, and Praskovya Prokhorova donated to the ward for the weak/afflicted with illness, to a free vocational school for women, and provided yet another building for free apartments (the architect of some of the buildings was the famous Lyev Kekyshev). In Soviet times, Syromyatniki was a large industrial area near the railway station and became a slum.

Businessman Roman Trotsenko founded the Winzavod Center for Contemporary Art. From 2007 to March 2012 the director of the "Winzavod" was the wife of the entrepreneur, Sofia Trotsenko, Dean of the Production Department of Art Theater School. Since March 2012, the Director of Winzavod appointed Elena Panteleyeva, who worked as the chief editor of Winzavod Art Review, a free monthly newspaper published by the art center. Lina Krasnyanskaya, who headed Winzavod's flagship Best of Russia project, became the executive director in 2016.

{{Wikisource|Mrs Warren's Profession}}
'''''Mrs. Warren's Profession''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[George Bernard Shaw]] in 1893, and first performed in London in 1902. The play is about a former prostitute, now a madam ([[brothel]] proprietor), who attempts to come to terms with her disapproving daughter. It is a [[problem play]], offering social commentary to illustrate Shaw's belief that the act of prostitution was not caused by moral failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from Shaw's 1882 novel ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'', about a man who becomes a boxer due to limited employment opportunities.

==Summary==

The story centres on the relationship between Mrs Kitty Warren and her daughter, Vivie. Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current [[brothel]] owner, is described as "on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old [[wikt:blackguard|blackguard]] of a woman." Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

==Plot==

Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] with honours in Mathematics (equal Third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.

==Characters==

*'''Mrs. Kitty Warren''': An attractive, middle-aged businesswoman and former prostitute, made wealthy by running a string of brothels.
*'''Mr. Praed''': A friend of Mrs. Warren, middle-aged and attractive, a good man.
*'''Sir George Crofts''': Mrs. Warren's business partner. A middle-aged, stodgy, entitled member of the upper class.
*'''Reverend Samuel Gardner''': A local minister and (possibly) Vivie's biological father.
*'''Vivie Warren''': Mrs. Warren's daughter, recently graduated from university with honours.
*'''Frank Gardner''': Youthful son of Reverend Gardner.

==Origins==
Shaw said he wrote the play "to draw attention to the truth that prostitution is caused, not by female depravity and male licentiousness, but simply by underpaying, undervaluing and overworking women so shamefully that the poorest of them are forced to resort to prostitution to keep body and soul together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge companion to Victorian and Edwardian theatre |first=Kerry |last=Powell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICi7QY_VSA8C&amp;pg=PA229 |page=229 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-79536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explained the source of the play in a letter to the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' on 28 April 1898:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss [[Janet Achurch]] [an actress and friend of Shaw’s] mentioned to me a novel by some [[French people|French]] writer [''Yvette'' by [[Guy de Maupassant]]] as having a dramatisable story in it. It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability—one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class—not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene—which a baby could write if its sight were normal—in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, ''[[Cashel Byron's Profession]]'' (hence the title, ''Mrs Warren's Profession''), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Mrs. Warren's Profession Study Guide| work =| pages =25–26| publisher =Guthrie Theater| year =2003| url =http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-14| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071031110511/http://www.guthrietheater.org/sites/default/files/mrswarren.pdf| archivedate =2007-10-31| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The play was originally banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]'s official theatre [[Censorship|censor]]) because of its frank discussion of [[prostitution]], but was finally performed on Sunday, 5 January 1902, at [[London]]'s New Lyric Club with the distinguished actor-manager [[Harley Granville-Barker]] as Frank, [[Fanny Brough]] as Mrs. Warren, George Goodhart as Sir George Crofts, Julius Knight as Praed, Madge McIntosh as Vivie and Cosmo Stuart as Rev.

The first public performance in London took place in 1925.

A 1905 performance in [[New York City|New York]], this time on a public stage, was interrupted by the [[NYPD|police]], who arrested the cast and crew for violating New York City's version of the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arnold Daley Held for his Shaw Play |publisher=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1905 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96493562/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later held not to be in violation of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Court Approves Bernard Shaw's Play |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 7, 1906 |url=http://0-search.proquest.com.iii.slcl.org/hnpnewyorktimes/docview/96637422/136D710970162E53BFE |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been revived on Broadway five times since.

The play has been twice revived by the National Theatre, first in 1970-71 at the Old Vic, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Coral Browne and Sarah Badel, and more recently at the Lyttelton Theatre in 1985-86, directed by Anthony Page, with Joan Plowright and Jessica Turner as Mrs Warren and Vivie.

The [[Shaw Festival]] at [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]] has mounted the play five times since the Festival's inception in 1962: 1976, 1990, 1997, 2008, and 2016 

In 2006, it was revived off-broadway by [[Irish Repertory Theatre|The Irish Repertory Theatre]], with [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. Warren, Laura Odeh as Vivie Warren, and [[David Staller]] as Mr. Praed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishrep.org/show/2005-2006-season/mrs-warrens-profession/|title=Mrs. Warren's Profession - Irish Repertory Theatre|author=|date=|website=irishrep.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived in 2010 in three separate venues:

* London's West End, at the [[Comedy Theatre]] with [[Felicity Kendal]] in the title role
* [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], by the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] at [[Sidney Harman Hall]], with [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in the title role
* [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] under the auspices of the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], with [[Cherry Jones]] as Kitty Warren and [[Sally Hawkins]] as Vivie

It was performed by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] in 2012, and was so popular that the season was extended.

In 2016 the play was performed at the Center Theatre in Seattle.

In 2018, Eleanor Bishop's adaptation of the play was performed at the ASB Waterfront Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand by the Auckland Theatre Company.

==Sequel==
Sir [[Harry Johnston]] wrote a sequel, a novel entitled ''Mrs. Warren's Daughter'', circa 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15380|title=Mrs. Warren's Daughter: A Story of the Woman's Movement by Harry Johnston|author=|date=|website=gutenberg.org|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A 1960 German film adaption, ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession (film)|Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'', starred [[Lilli Palmer]].

BBC Television produced a television version first broadcast on 3 October, 1972 on [[BBC2]] under the 'Stage 2' drama strand.&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/fce706d308d34b28935c4c64df0c7666&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Cedric Messina]] and directed by [[Herbert Wise]], it starred [[Coral Browne]] in the title role, with [[Penelope Wilton]] as Vivie. Also in the cast were [[James Grout]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] and [[Derek Godfrey]]. Under the ''[[Play of the Month]]'' strand, the production was repeated on [[BBC1]] on 21 April, 1974&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/66c1ecd4a77a4700ace420bc4b92aad1&lt;/ref&gt;. The production was released on DVD in 2006.

A radio adaptation was broadcast on the [[BBC]] in 2002, and re-broadcast in January 2009 on [[BBC Radio 7]], starring [[Maggie Steed]] in the title role.

==Vivie's character and the changing role of women==

Men who could afford to get married in the Victorian era could make use of “laws that gave him total control of his wife's person—and her fortune”.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Dan H. "Victorians Unveiled: Some Thoughts on Mrs. Warren’s Profession". Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies 24 (2004): 40. Retrieved 2010-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian women were expected to maintain a poised and dignified manner, and to obey their husbands. Vivie defies the Victorian expectations of an obedient woman: she is educated and entirely self-sufficient. She rejects two marriage proposals, reflecting her reliance on her work ethic and hard-headed approach to life. Shaw represents Vivie as the product of a type of gender reformation: a character who is asexual and "permanently unromantic".&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Warren's Profession", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Twentieth Century and Beyond'' (eds. Joseph Black, et al.) Canada: Broadview, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the play, the boundary between sexual desires and proposed marriages is blurred. Frank flirts with both Mrs. Warren and Vivie; Mrs. Warren's companion Sir George Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie despite his relationship with her mother. Critic Petra Dierkes-Thrun argues that these examples illustrate the way in which Shaw "critiqued the ideological and economic system that produced her [Mrs. Warren], attacking the problematic double standard of [[male privilege]] and the deeply entrenched objectification of women, which Shaw saw pervading all levels of Victorian society down to its most basic nuclear element, the family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://z3950.muse.jhu.edu/journals/english_literature_in_transition/related/v049/49.3.dierkes-thrun.html Dierkes-Thrun, Petra].

The '''Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute''' (MWPAI) is a regional fine [[Arts centre|arts center]] founded in 1919 and located in [[Utica, New York]]. The institute has three program divisions:
*Museum of art
*Performing arts
*School of art

==Museum of art==
The museum of art has a substantial permanent collection of internationally recognized works.  They are exhibited in the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute Museum of Art Building.  It is an [[International style (architecture)|International-style]] building designed by [[architect]] [[Philip Johnson]] and completed in 1960. A model of the building was exhibited in the United States Pavilion at the [[Expo 58|Brussels' World's Fair of 1958]]. It is a 60,000 sqft&lt;ref&gt;Asad Syrkett, http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/5335-a-golden-anniversary-for-a-philip-johnson-museum&lt;/ref&gt; square and supported by eight external ferro-concrete piers, or two on each side.  The exterior structural members are clad in [[bronze]] and "black" Canadian [[granite]]. The windowless cube is set above windowed office areas recessed in a dry moat, giving a "floating" effect.  The interior features a two-story central courtyard, illuminated by a skylight, known as the Edward Wales Root Sculpture Court.  It also holds an [[auditorium]] seating 271.&lt;ref name="NysNrhpNom"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/ | title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-08-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web | url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=26073&amp;q=false | title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute | accessdate = 2016-08-01 | author = Rand Carter and Travis Bowman| format = PDF| date=December 2009}} and [https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=25868&amp;q=false ''Accompanying five photographs'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="nps"/&gt;

Next-door is a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Victorian era|era]] [[Italianate]] mansion called ''[[Fountain Elms]]'',  listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It houses the MWPAI [[decorative arts]] collection. It is connected to the Museum of Art building by an education wing built in 1995.

The museum has an extensive collection of European and American art. A highlight of the permanent collection is the first of the two original sets of [[Thomas Cole]]'s famous series of paintings titled ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'': The second set is at the [[National Gallery]] [[Washington, DC.]]

==PrattMWP==
The institute also has a program called ''Pratt at Munson-Williams-Proctor'' (MWP) which allows students to study for two years in [[Utica, New York]], called a "Foundations Program", before completing their [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree at [[Pratt Institute]]'s main campus in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. PrattMWP is accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]], [[Middle States Association]], and [[New York State Education Department]].

'''''Nepenthes''''' is a series of four sculptures by artist [[Dan Corson]], installed in 2013 along Northwest Davis Street in the [[Old Town Chinatown]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. The work was inspired by the [[genus]] of [[carnivorous plant|carnivorous]] [[Nepenthes|plants of the same name]], known as tropical [[pitcher plant]]s. The sculptures are {{Convert|17|ft|m}} tall and glow in the dark due to [[photovoltaics]].

The work was commissioned by [[TriMet]]'s Portland Mall Project in an attempt to increase "pedestrian connectivity" between Old Town Chinatown and the [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]]. Corson was hired by the Portland Mall Project's design team, which was led by [[ZGF Architects LLP]].&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hottman/&gt; The Old Town/Chinatown Visions Committee was also involved in early stages of the project.&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; Once the project evolved from a lighting project into a sculpture,&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; TriMet asked RACC to facilitate the project on behalf of the city's public art collection.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; The project had a $300,000 budget and required several design changes.&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; RACC assembled a panel of "original stakeholders", artists and neighbors, to refine Corson's design.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hottman/&gt; The agency worked with Portland Transportation to determine the exact placement of the pieces.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; Some of them were reportedly placed in "awkward" locations in order to receive direct light so the solar panels could function properly, or to accommodate infrastructure beneath the sidewalk.&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; The sculptures were installed in May 2013.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hottman/&gt;

A version of the statues has been installed in the newly developed community of [[Paisley, Edmonton]] using the molds developed for the City of Portland.  The Edmonton rendering is called ''Nepenthes Paisleyi'' and contains sensors which pick up on people's movements to trigger light animations after nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/07/08/paisley-open-for-business Paisley open for business] Edmonton Sun, July 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Nepenthes'' received a mixed reception. RACC has reportedly received mixed reviews from "folks who felt that [the sculptures] sort of appeared out of nowhere and were a little random in their placement."&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; One spokesperson for the agency said people directly involved with the project were happy with the final product. ''[[Willamette Week]]''{{'s}} Richard Spear called the work an "atrocity", "garish and cheap-looking."&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; He wrote that the pieces were more appropriate for an outlet mall in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], "come across as dumbed-down knockoffs of [[Dale Chihuly|Chihuly]] glass", and "could be used as props in a high-school staging of ''The Little Mermaid''".&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; Following installation, the owner of a gallery located next to one of the sculptures compared them to [[lava lamp]]s and expressed hope that they would be run over by a truck.&lt;ref name=Speer/&gt; 

On the other hand, the American media company [[PSFK]] called the designs "startling", noting that as street lamps, "they are far from your typical metal and light bulb structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2013/07/carnivorous-plant-solar-lamps.html|title=Carnivorous Plant Solar Lamps Glow in City Streets|first=Lea|last=Gonzalez|publisher=[[PSFK]]|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Metcalfe of [[The Atlantic#CityLab|CityLab]] writes, "Portland residents have had the unexpected pleasure of walking through an alien greenhouse of huge, bizarrely colored carnivorous plants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2013/07/closer-look-portlands-hulking-carnivorous-street-lights/6087/|title=A Closer Look at Portland's Giant, Carnivorous Street Lights|first=John|last=Metcalfe|publisher=CityLab|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art and Architecture refers to them as "amazing structures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/category/u-s-cities-other/portland Art and Architecture: Nepenthes in Portland, Oregon, by Dan Corson] Oct 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The online trend community blog [[Trend Hunter]] calls the work "incredibly vibrant" and "visually striking", and says it "gives 'urban jungle' a completely new meaning".&lt;ref name=trend&gt;[http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/nepenthes-by-dan-corson Nepenthes by Dan Corson Turns Portland into an Eco Jungle] by Meghan Young, Trend Hunter, Jul 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture and design weblog [[Inhabitat]] calls them "beautiful, quirky and exotically colorful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/dan-corsons-solar-powered-sculptures-in-portland-oregon-are-inspired-by-quirky-tropical-plants/nepenthes-solar-powered-sculpture-dan-corson-1/ Dan Corson's Solar-Powered Sculptures in Portland, Oregon are Inspired by Quirky Tropical Plants, by Lidija Grozdanic, 07/04/13]&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily web magazine [[Designboom]] says of the statues, "each fiberglass sculpture glows from within at night creating an intriguing and dramatic street presence",&lt;ref name=designboom/&gt; "curvaceous shadows animate the sidewalk on sunny days",&lt;ref name=designboom/&gt; and the sculptures are "touchable: many people are drawn to the form or surfaces and feel compelled to stroke them as they walk by".&lt;ref name=designboom&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/design/nephenthes/ energy-creating nephenthes plant sculptures by dan corson] designboom, Jun 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Kristi in Arts, a Portland public art blog, noting that, "The goal is for the sculptures to create an inviting pathway leading people from the Pearl District into Old Town"&lt;ref name=kristi/&gt; comments, "I wish they had installed about 10 more leading further into Northwest,"&lt;ref name=kristi/&gt; and then adds, "Not only do they look fantastic, but they are powered by solar and run LED lights.

The first complete translation into English was published in 1799. The second, by John T. Goldthwait, was published in 1960 by the [[University of California Press]].

== Section One ==
''Of the Distinct Objects of the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Kant states that feelings of enjoyment are subjective. In this book, he describes his observations. His interest is not in coarse, thoughtless feelings or in the other extreme, the finest feelings of intellectual discovery. Instead, he writes about the finer feelings, which are intermediate. These require some sensitivity, intellectual excellence, talent, or virtue.

There are two kinds of finer feeling: the feeling of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the feeling of the beautiful. Kant gives examples of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of feelings of the beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. Feelings of the sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.

In this section, Kant gives many particular examples of feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Feelings of the beautiful "occasion a pleasant sensation but one that is joyous and smiling." On the other hand, feelings of the sublime "arouse enjoyment but with horror."

Kant subdivided the sublime into three kinds. The feeling of the terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread or melancholy. The feeling of the noble sublime is quiet wonder. Feelings of the splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.

== Section Two ==
''Of the Attributes of the Beautiful and Sublime in Man in General''

Kant described the relationship between these finer feelings and humanity. The feelings are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs the feeling of the sublime. Comedy arouses feelings for beauty. The personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.

Human nature has many variations of the feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Some variations of the terrifying sublime are the adventurous and grotesque. Visionaries and cranks are persons who have fantasies and whims. The beautiful, when it degenerates, produces triflers, fops, dandies, chatterers, silliness, bores, and fools.

Sympathy or compassion and also good-natured agreeableness are not true virtues, according to Kant. True virtue is the quality of raising the feeling of humanity's beauty and dignity to a principle. When a person acts in accordance with this principle, regardless of inclination, that person is truly and sublimely virtuous.

"A profound feeling for the beauty and dignity of human nature and a firmness and determination of the mind to refer all one's actions to this as to a universal ground is earnest, and does not at all join with a changeable gaiety nor with the inconstancy of a frivolous person." With this observation, Kant will attempt to fit the various feelings of the beautiful and sublime, and the resulting moral characters, into [[Galen]]'s rigid arrangement of [[the four humours]] or human [[temperament]]s: [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[Four temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]], [[choleric]], and [[phlegmatic]].

Kant asserted that the human temperaments or dispositions are  fixed and separate characters. An individual who has one frame of mind has no feeling or sense for the finer feelings that occur in a person of another temperament. 
*A person who has a constitution that is melancholic will have a predominating feeling for the sublime. That person may possess genuine virtue based on the principle that humanity has beauty and worth.
*One who has a sanguine nature will mostly have a feeling for the beautiful. This results in an "adoptive" virtue that rests on goodheartedness. This person's compassion and sympathy depend on the impression of the moment.
*A choleric human will have a feeling for the splendid or showy sublime. As a result, this person will possess an apparent virtue. Kant calls it "a gloss of virtue." This includes a sense of honor and concern for outward appearance.
*Phlegmatic people have apathy or lack of any finer feeling. They therefore may have an absence of virtue.
As a whole, human nature in general is a combination of these virtues. As such, it is a splendid expression of beauty and dignity.

== Section Three ==
''Of the Distinction of the Beautiful and Sublime in the Interrelations of the Two Sexes''

In Section Three, Kant asserts that women predominantly have feelings for all that is beautiful. Men, on the contrary, have mostly feelings for the sublime. Any other feelings that are only for the enhancement of the main feeling. Kant admits, though, that the distinction is not absolute. Since "we are dealing with human beings; we must also remember that they are not all alike."

Kant helps to root notions of inequality in the Western social structure.  For example, Kant argues that "a woman is little embarrassed that she does not possess high insights; she is beautiful and captivates, and that is enough ... Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroys the merits that are proper to her sex."

Women's mental ability and understanding, then, refer to the beautiful. Men's deep, noble understanding is not suitable for women. Women have beautiful virtues such as kindness and benevolence. Men's virtue is noble and has to do with principles and duty. Because a woman is concerned with the beautiful, the worst that can be said against her is that she is disgusting. A man's greatest defect, however, would be that he is ridiculous, as this is the opposite of the sublime.

In sexual selection, a woman demands that the man have noble and sublime characteristics. A man wants a woman to possess beautiful qualities. In a marriage, the husband and wife unite their disparate attributes to form, as it were, a single moral person. The man's understanding combines with the wife's taste to constitute a union.

== Section Four ==
''Of National Characteristics, so far as They Depend upon the Distinct Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime''

Here Kant describes the different ways that various people have finer feelings. He qualifies his remarks by stating, "[W]hether these national differences are contingent and depend upon the times and the type of government, or are bound by a certain necessity to the climate, I do not here inquire."

The [[Italy|Italians]] have a strong feeling for the beautiful with some mixture of the thoughtful sublime. The French have mostly a feeling for the beautiful, but with the addition of the joyful sublime. The feeling of the Germans is an almost equal blend of both the beautiful and the splendid sublime in that they are much concerned with outward appearances. The feeling of the noble sublime predominates with the English, whose actions are guided by principles rather than impulses. With their cruel [[auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]] and harsh conquests, the [[Spaniard]]s have feeling for the terrifying sublime. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] people in [[Holland]] have no finer taste and are concerned only with what is useful. [[Arab]]s are like the Spaniards. [[Persian people|Persian]]s resemble the French. The [[Japan]]ese are the Englishmen of the [[Orient]]. West India displays its love of the grotesque sublime, as also do the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]. [[Africa]]n [[Negro]]es possess no finer feelings. [[North America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], however, have a feeling for the sublime in that they are adventurous, honorable, truthful, proud, brave, and valorous.

In antiquity, the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had remarkable feelings for both the beautiful and the sublime. However, with the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], this decayed into a love of false glitter. The subsequent [[barbarian]] [[goths|Gothic]] civilization had an overpowering feeling for the grotesque. Kant claimed that his time witnessed "the sound taste of the beautiful and noble blossoming forth both in the arts and sciences and in respect to morals." He declared that it is necessary to educate the younger generation so that they will have noble simplicity, high morals, and finer feelings.

'''Shape Arts''' or '''Shape''' is a London-based arts charity, funded by [[Arts Council England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/shape-london |title=Browse: National portfolio organisations |publisher=Arts Council |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is committed to providing opportunities for disabled individuals wanting to work in the arts and cultural sector. It trains participants and runs arts and development programmes across all of the creative arts: visual arts, music, dance, writing and acting. Shape Arts partners with major cultural institutions to create positive change for disabled people by improving access, exposure and opportunities in contemporary art.

==History==
Shape was founded by Gina Levete MBE in 1976 with project funding from the [[Gulbenkian Foundation]].&lt;ref name="shapearts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/shape-at-a-glance |title=Shape at a glance |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current CEO is [[Tony Heaton]] OBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Kim |date=2011-03-15 |title=Tony Heaton: joining the national network |url=http://www.culturalleadership.org.uk/375/ |publisher=Cultural Leadership Programme |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shape was informed by the political activism of the 60s. [[Disability arts]] grew out of the [[disability rights movement]], and the wider struggle by disabled people for equality and the right to participate in all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="shapearts1"/&gt;

==Activities==
Their mission is to provide skills, opportunities and support for disabled artists, individuals and cultural organisations; and help build a more inclusive cultural sector. It does this through four delivery aims:

*More disabled people employed in the creative industries
*More disabled people as audiences
*Disabled artists creating high quality creative work
*Disabled people participating in the arts

==Notable artists==
*[[Yinka Shonibare]] is a disabled artist who worked as an arts development officer at Shape in the 90s. Shonibare acknowledges the role that Shape Arts played in his early career: "I worked for Shape three days a week, running workshops on singing, dancing or visual arts for disabled and older people in day centres and hospitals. The job meant I could afford to rent a studio and it gave me organisational and fundraising skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/entertainment/arts/an-artist-with-a-lot-of-bottle |title=An artist with a lot of bottle — Disability Now |publisher=Disabilitynow.org.uk |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape 'Open' exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to a disability focused theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shape Open exhibition Patron Announced|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/shape-open-exhibition-patron-announced.aspx|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yinka Shonibare MBE Announces Winner of Shape Open 2013 |url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/yinka-shonibare-mbe-announces-winner-of-shape-open-2013 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guy Evans]], a founding member of [[Echo City]], is a [[progressive rock]] drummer with [[Subterraneans (band)|Subterraneans]] who worked at Shape Arts in an administrative role and as a workshop leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unique music |url=https://ccskills.org.uk/careers/advice/article/unique-music |website=ccskills.org.uk |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kelly Knox]], one of Britain's leading disabled fashion models, worked at Shape Arts for a number of years as a programme co-ordinator.

==Financial Support==
Renowned British contemporary artists have donated artworks to Shape to raise money for the charity through an auction at [[Bonhams]]. Funds raised from the sale were matched by the Arts Council’s Catalyst Arts Fund and went towards supporting new arts activities and opportunities for disabled people. Works by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], [[Mat Collishaw]], [[Angela de la Cruz]], [[Tacita Dean]], Sir [[Antony Gormley]], [[Marc Quinn]] and [[David Shrigley]] were auctioned at Bonhams London on 4 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Blog/shapes-inaugural-contemporary-art-fundraiser |title=Blog &amp;#124; Shape's Inaugural Contemporary Art Fundraiser |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an online auction at [[Paddle8]] included donations of twenty-five artworks from a range of internationally acclaimed artists including [[Jeremy Deller]], [[Julie Umerle]], [[Candida Hofer]], [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]], [[Hito Steyerl]], [[Grayson Perry]] and [[Hans Op de Beeck]] in support of Shape Arts' 40th anniversary and the continued importance of the organisation's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shapearts.org.uk/Event/shape-art-auction |title=Shape Benefit Art Auction &amp; Exhibition |publisher=Shape Arts |date= |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Hutchinson |url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/shape-arts-40th-anniversary-auction-raises-27k |title=Shape Arts 40th anniversary auction raises £27,000 « a-n The Artists Information Company |publisher=A-n.co.uk |date=2016-04-26 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adam Reynolds' Memorial Bursary ==

The Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary was inaugurated in 2008 in memory of the sculptor Adam Reynolds (1959-2005). It is one of the most significant opportunities for disabled visual artists in the UK, offering an opportunity to engage in a three-month residency at a high-profile gallery. Venues that have hosted the residencies include the [[V &amp; A]], [[Camden Arts Centre]], [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], The [[BALTIC]], the [[Bluecoat Gallery]] and [[New Art Gallery Walsall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Adam-Reynolds-Memorial-Bursary-Shape-The-First-Four |title=Discussion: John O'Donoghue gives an overview of the Shape's Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary: The First Four |publisher=disability arts online |date=2013-06-14 |accessdate=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Software incompatibility''' is a characteristic of [[software]] components or [[Software system|systems]] which cannot operate satisfactorily together on the same [[computer]], or on different computers linked by a [[computer network]]. They may be components or systems which are intended to operate cooperatively or independently. [[Software compatibility]] is a characteristic of software components or systems which can operate satisfactorily together on the same computer, or on different computers linked by a computer network. It is possible that some software components or systems may be compatible in one environment and incompatible in another.

==Examples==
===Deadlocks===
Consider sequential programs of the form:

 Request [[Resource (computer science)|resource]] A
 Request resource B
 Perform action using A and B
 Release resource B
 Release resource A

A particular [[Computer program|program]] might use a [[Computer printer|printer]] (resource A) and a [[Computer file|file]] (resource B) in order to print the file.

If several such programs P1,P2,P3 ... operate at the same time, then the first one to [[Execution (computing)|execute]] will [[Blocking (computing)|block]] the others until the resources are released, and the programs will execute in turn. There will be no problem. It makes no difference whether a [[uniprocessor|uni-processor]] or a [[multi-processor]] system is used, as it's the allocation of the resources which determines the order of execution.

Note, however, that [[programmers]] are, in general, not constrained to write programs in a particular way, or even if there are guidelines, then some may differ from the guidelines. A variant of the previous program may be:

 Request resource B
 Request resource A
 Perform action using A and B
 Release resource A
 Release resource B

The resources A and B are the same as in the previous example &amp;ndash; not simply [[bound variable|dummy variables]], as otherwise the programs are identical.

As before, if there are several such programs, Q1,Q2,Q3 which run at the same time using resources as before, there will be no problem.

However, if several of the Ps are set to run at the same time as several of the Qs, then a [[deadlock]] condition can arise. Note that the deadlock need not arise, but may.

 P: Request resource A
 Q: Request resource B
 Q: Request resource A (blocked by P)
 P: Request resource B (blocked by Q)
 ...

Now neither P nor Q can proceed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is one kind of example where programs may demonstrate incompatibility.

===Interface incompatibility===
Another example of a different kind would be where one software component provides service to another. The incompatibility could be as simple as a change in the order of [[Parameter (computer science)|parameters]] between the software component requesting service, and the component providing the service. This would be a kind of [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] incompatibility. This might be considered a [[Software bug|bug]], but could be very hard to detect in some systems. Some interface incompatibilities can easily be detected during the [[Software build|build stage]], particularly for strongly [[Data type|typed]] systems, others may be hard to find and may only be detected at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], while others may be almost impossible to detect without a detailed program analysis.

Consider the following example:

  Component P calls component Q with parameters x and y. For this example, y may be an integer.

  Q returns f(x) which is desired and never zero, and ignores y.

A variant of Q, Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; has similar behaviour, with the following differences:

  if y = 100, then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not terminate.

If P never calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead is a compatible [[computation]].
However if P calls Q with y set to 100, then using Q&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead will lead to a non-terminating computation. 

If we assume further that f(x) has a numeric value, then component Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; defined as:

  Q'' behaves as Q except that
  if y = 100 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not terminate
  if y = 101 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns 0.9 * f(x)
  if y = 102 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns a random value
  if y = 103 then Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns 0.

may cause problem behaviour. If P now calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with  = 101, then the results of the computation will be incorrect, but may not cause a program failure. If P calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with y = 102 then the results are unpredictable, and [[Crash (computing)|failure]] may arise, possibly due to [[Division by zero|divide by zero]] or other errors such as [[arithmetic overflow]].
If P calls Q&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with y= 103 then in the event that P uses the result in a division operation, then a divide by zero failure may occur.

This example shows how one program P1 may be always compatible with another Q1, but that there can be constructed other programs Q1' and Q1&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; such that P1 and Q' are sometimes incompatible, and P1 and Q1&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; are always incompatible.

===Performance incompatibility===
Sometimes programs P and Q can be running on the same computer, and the presence of one will inhibit the performance of the other. This can particularly happen where the computer uses [[virtual memory]]. The result may be that [[disk thrashing]] occurs, and one or both programs will have significantly reduced performance. This form of incompatibility can occur if P and Q are intended to cooperate, but can also occur if P and Q are completely unrelated but just happen to run at the same time. An example might be if P is a program which produces large output files, which happen to be stored in [[Computer data storage#Primary storage|main memory]], and Q is an anti-virus program which scans many files on the hard disk. If a [[CPU cache|memory cache]] is used for virtual memory, then it is possible for the two programs to interact adversely and the performance of each will be drastically reduced.

For some programs P and Q their performance compatibility may depend on the environment in which they are run. They may be substantially incompatible if they are run on a computer with limited main memory, yet it may be possible to run them satisfactorily on a machine with more memory. Some programs may be performance incompatible in almost any environment.

In the [[performing arts]], a '''stage mother''' is the mother of a [[child actor]]. The mother will often drive her child to auditions, make sure he or she is on the [[Set construction|set]] on time, etc.  The term ''stage mother'' sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist|title=Living Vicariously through Children with a Twist|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent.

==Definition==
A stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., [[Rose Thompson Hovick]], [[Dina Lohan]], [[Judy Garland|Ethel Gumm]], [[Teri Shields]], [[Hilary Duff|Susan Duff]], etc.) &amp;mdash; representing her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as "momagers" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="momager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/07/13/beyonce-manager-matthew-knowles-britney-spears-kardashian-simpson/#more-50228|title=From Beyonce To Britney Spears, Is It Ever A Good Idea To Be Managed By A Parent?|accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of "stage mother" can be affixed to the mother{{by whom|date=October 2014}} without cause. [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film ''[[Model Behavior]]'', it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie.

==Stage fathers==
Fathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]] (patriarch of the [[Jackson family]]), [[Murry Wilson]] (father of three of [[The Beach Boys]]), Joe Simpson (father of [[Jessica Simpson|Jessica]] and [[Ashlee Simpson]]), Jeff Archuleta (father of ''[[American Idol]]'' runner-up [[David Archuleta]]), [[Mathew Knowles]] (father of [[Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles]]) and [[Kit Culkin]] (father of [[Macaulay Culkin|Macaulay]] and [[Kieran Culkin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705759/The-father-from-hell.html|title=The father from hell?|date=1996-11-09|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example of such a father was [[Leopold Mozart]], who recognized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his son's]] musical ability at an early age and made the most of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Holmes (musicologist) |date=1845 |title=The Life of Mozart Including His Correspondence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], father of Tejano superstar [[Selena]], is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days.

Stage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/03/16/lavar-ball-hurt-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-stock-ucla-march-madness/99248918/|title=Could LaVar Ball scare NBA teams from drafting Lonzo Ball?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and  backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates.&lt;ref&gt;"Was it Guys Like These who Ruined Sportsmanship....or was it Just Us?"

== Script mother ==
A variant of the term has been a "script mother", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

An example of a script mother has been [[Lynn Johnston]], who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip ''For Better or for Worse'', as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a [[private school]] with tougher regulations on student conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnston "Kate and I were constantly bullied due to the strip" Suddenly Silver, 25 Years of FBOFW, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6188">'''''Symphony on a Hymn Tune''''' is a four-movement [[orchestra]]l composition by the American composer [[Virgil Thomson]].  The work was Thomson's first [[symphony]] and was composed between 1926 and 1928 while Thomson studied with the composer [[Nadia Boulanger]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Tommasini" &gt;Tommasini, p. 152-156&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the work was not premiered until February 22, 1945, with Thomson leading the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic Symphony Society]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="CD liner" &gt;{{cite album-notes |title=THOMSON, V.: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 / Symphony on a Hymn Tune |year=2000  |url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559022&amp;catNum=559022&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English |first1=Marina |last1=Ledin |first2=Ledin |last2=Victor |format=CD liner note |publisher=[[Naxos Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and composition==
Lasting roughly twenty minutes in performance, ''Symphony on a Hymn Tune'' is composed in four movements:
#Introduction &amp; Allegro
#Andante cantabile
#Allegretto
#Alla breve

The first three movements were composed between 1926 and spring 1927, though Thomson, daunted by the finale, did not begin work on the fourth movement until July 1928.&lt;ref name="Tommasini" /&gt;  The piece was completed in late 1928 and was lightly revised by Thomson before its premiere in 1945.&lt;ref name="CD liner" /&gt;  The [[protestant]] [[hymn]]s "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" and "[[How Firm a Foundation (hymn)|How Firm a Foundation]]" serve as a thematic basis for the symphony,&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oja |first=Carol J. |title=Symphonic For The People: The Mid-Century American Symphony |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=August 20, 2013 |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/08/19/213469159/symphonic-for-the-people-the-mid-century-american-symphony |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the work is also influenced by other historic [[Religious music|sacred music]] styles.&lt;ref name="Tommasini" /&gt;  Additionally, the piece occasionally references the popular tune used in the song "[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]."&lt;ref name="Tommasini" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (one doubling on [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn]]s, two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]], [[tambourine]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[cymbal]]s, [[Gong#Chau gong .28Tam-tam.29|tamtam]], [[bass drum]], and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="CD liner" /&gt;

==Reception==
The music critic John von Rhein of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the work "a kind of homespun-sophisticated musical analogue to a [[Currier and Ives]] print."&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rhein |first=John von |title=Virgil Thomson: Symphony on a Hymn Tune, Symphony No. 2... |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=August 20, 1989 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-08-20/entertainment/8901060270_1_virgil-thomson-new-york-philharmonic-lord-byron |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', Algis Valiunas opined that the work "stands worthily beside the far more famous orchestral music of [[Aaron Copland]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valiunas |first=Algis |title=Notes and Music: The words of Virgil Thomson, composer and critic |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |date=February 2, 2015 |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/notes-and-music_824287.html |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Buell of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' further praised that the work's "peculiar procedures somehow suggest that Thomson has given both a kit for a symphony and the improbable assembled thing itself.  There's nothing extraneous, it's strong as hell and the parts fit, but you could swear that some of them have deliberately been put in upside down."&lt;ref name="Tommasini" /&gt;  Carol J. Oja of [[NPR]] especially praised the fourth movement, "Alla breve," saying, "The fourth movement reveals how Thomson transforms melodic material. Sometimes he does so transparently, sometimes with intentional 'wrong' notes. In an era when his modernist colleagues often revered complexity, Thomson took a radical turn to simpler writing, and his cinematically sweeping melodies evoke vast expanses of the American prairie."&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Significant passages from ''Symphony on a Hymn Tune'' were reused by Thomson in his score to the 1938 documentary ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' by [[Pare Lorentz]].&lt;ref name="CD liner" /&gt;  Movements from ''The River'' were later used to score the 1983 television film ''[[The Day After]]'' by the director [[Nicholas Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stuever |first=Hank |authorlink=Hank Stuever |title='Convincing catastrophe': What The Post's TV critic wrote about 'The Day After' in 1983 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 11, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/05/11/convincing-catastrophe-what-the-posts-tv-critic-wrote-about-the-day-after-in-1983/ |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Symphony on a Hymn Tune'' was also arranged for piano duet by American pianist [[John Kirkpatrick (pianist)|John Kirkpatrick]].&lt;ref name="Tommasini" /&gt;

'''''The Marathon Family''''' ({{lang-sh|Maratonci trče počasni krug}}, lit. ''Marathon Runners Do a Lap of Honour'', or often simply ''Maratonci'', lit. ''The Marathon Runners'') is a 1982 [[Cinema of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav black comedy film]] written by [[Dušan Kovačević]] and directed by [[Serbia]]n director [[Slobodan Šijan]]. It has become a [[cult film]] in Serbia and other countries from the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disintegration in Frames|last=Levi|first=Pavle|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780804753685|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sdi63FxE7EC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the classics of Yugoslav Serbian cinematography.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Plot==
The story takes place in an unnamed small Serbian town in 1935, and focuses on the Topalović family consisting of six generations of [[undertaker]]s: gravely ill Pantelija, wheelchair-bound Maksimilijan who's also mute and nearly deaf, rheumatic Aksentije, sober-minded Milutin, impulsive and narcissistic Laki, and young and naive Mirko. Constantly bickering amongst each other, the latest family arguments arise from the youngest son, Mirko, not wanting to continue the family business of coffin-making. Deeply in love with a local girl Kristina, the daughter of a local hoodlum Bili Piton, he's looking to avoid the career path of his father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. 

Though operating out of a prominently located shop in the town, Topalovićs' business is mostly based on illegal activities. Instead of making brand new coffins, they simply recycle already used ones with the help of Bili Piton, whose men dig them out from the local cemetery during the night. Once they get their hands on the coffins that had been dug up, Topalovićs simply refurbish them and sell them as new, thereby making a large profit with very little [[overhead cost|overhead]]. Based on mutual financial interest, the business relationship between Topalovićs and Bili is deteriorating by the day as they owe him a large sum of money for the past services rendered and show no intention of paying him.

In parallel, Topalovićs are in the finishing stages of building a modern [[crematory]] on which they're placing high hopes as the future source of income.

One day, the oldest Topalović, Pantelija, dies and leaves family inheritance to himself because he does not trust his successors. Topalovićs leave business with Bili Piton and he threatens to report them to the police for killing a man in a car accident. Bili's daughter, Mirko's love Kristina wishes to become an actress in (mostly pornographic) movies made by Mirko's best friend Đenka. However, she cheats on Mirko with Đenka, so outraged Mirko kills her when he finds out. He returns to his family and makes himself their leader by force, while Đenka is accidentally burned alive by the deaf Maksimilijan, while repairing the crematorium. The movie ends with a showdown between the Topalovićs and Bili Piton, in which Bili Piton is killed, and then a chase between Topalovićs and the police, with a scene abruptly cut just as raging Mirko attempts to run over a police officer fallen from a bicycle.

==Awards==
The Marathon Family won two awards in 1982, including the Jury Prize at the [[Montréal World Film Festival]] and the "Best Actress" award at the [[Pula Film Festival]], which went to [[Seka Sablić]] for her portrayal of Kristina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084302/awards?ref_=tt_awd imdb awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 1000 AD (AH 390/1), it is Al-Biruni's first major work, compiled in [[Gorgan]], at the court of [[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir|Qabus]], when he was in his late twenties.&lt;ref name="Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1993 p. 108"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' (1993), {{ISBN|0-7914-1515-5}}, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The text survives in an early 14th-century [[Ilkhanid]] manuscript by Ibn al-Kutbi (the "Edinburgh codex", AH 707 / AD 1307–8, 179 folios, Northwestern Iran or northern Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;The precise place of origin is uncertain. Soucek 1975, p. 156, suggested [[Tabriz]] or [[Maragha]]; Carboni (1988–89,17; 1992, 432f., suggested [[Mosul]] on the basis of a comparison of some of its illustrations with others in the so-called London Qazvini (cat. nos. 14–16). Hillenbrand  supports the attribution to Mosul.&lt;/ref&gt; kept at the [[Edinburgh University Library]], MS Arab 161). The manuscript contains 25 paintings and survives also in an exact 17th-century Ottoman copy (MS Arabe 1489, kept in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]).

Hillenbrand (2000) interprets the choice and placement of illustrations throughout the text as a cycle which emphasizes the interest of the Ilkhanids in religions other than the predominant Islam, many illustrations showing specific episodes related to [[Manichaeism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]]. Other illustrations show a keen interest in topics of history and science. The account of the birth of [[Julius Caesar]] is illustrated with a realistic rendition of a [[cesarean section]].

The [[Shi`ite]] inclination of those responsible for the production is particularly evident from the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which illustrate two episodes in the life of [[Muhammad]], both centrally involving [[`Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]:  The Day of Cursing (fol. 161r) and The Investiture of `Ali at [[Ghadir Khumm]] (fol. 162r). The manuscript has a total of five images [[depictions of Muhammad|depicting Muhammad]], including the first miniature which shows the Prophet as he prohibits [[Nasīʾ]] (fol. 6v).&lt;ref&gt;The cycle is among the earliest depictions of Muhammad in Persian art. The earliest extant representation of Muhammad in a Persian manuscript is in the [[Marzubannama]] of 1299 (Archaeology Museum Library, Istanbul, MS 216);  see fig. 49 in Marianna Shreve Simpson. 'The Role of Baghdad in the Formation of Persian Painting.' In ''Art et société dans le monde iranien'', ed. Chahryar Adle,  91–116. Institut Français d'Iranologie de Téhéran, Bibliothèque iranienne, 26. Recherche sur les grandes civilisations, Synthèse, 9. Paris: Éditions Recherche sur les civilisations, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the images is kept in a hybrid style between that of pre-Mongol period Persia and the Chinese style introduced with the Mongol invasions.

==History==
He discussed his idea of [[history]] in ''The Chronology of the Ancient Nations'',&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;M. S. Khan (1976). "al-Biruni and the Political History of India", ''Oriens'' '''25''', p. 86-115.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries''. It is a comparative study of calendars of different cultures and civilizations, interlaced with mathematical, astronomical, and historical information, exploring the customs and religions of different peoples.

In ''The Chronology Of Ancient Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;Albiruni. The Chronology Of Ancient Nations, trans.Edward Sachau. London: Elibron Classics, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions the birth and death of the [[Caliph]]s, [[Shia Imam]]s, [[Fatimah]] (daughter of Muhammad) and [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]] (Muhammad's wife).&lt;ref&gt;The Chronology Of Ancient Nations, trans.Edward Sachau. London: Elibron Classics, 2005, pp.325-334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical geography==
Discussing the [[astrolabe]], Al-Biruni considers the [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] [[cylindrical projection]] as his own invention, expanding upon the work of [[Al-Saghani]].&lt;ref&gt;Boris Abramovich Rozenfelʹd, ''A History of Non-Euclidean Geometry'', trans.

'''''The Second of May 1808''''', also known as '''''The Charge of the Mamelukes''''' (in Spanish: ''El 2 de mayo de 1808 en Madrid'', or ''La lucha con los mamelucos'' or ''La carga de los mamelucos''&lt;ref&gt; {{es}} [http://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/galeria-on-line/galeria-on-line/obra/el-2-de-mayo-de-1808-en-madrid-la-lucha-con-los-mamelucos/ Online Gallery] [[Prado Museum]]. Retrieved 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;), is a painting by the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]]. It is a companion to the painting ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' and is set in the [[Calle de Alcalá]] near [[Puerta del Sol]], [[Madrid]], during the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]]. It depicts one of the many people's rebellions against the French occupation of [[Spain]] that sparked the [[Peninsular War]].

Both paintings were completed in a two-month time frame in 1814. Today they are displayed in Madrid's [[Museo del Prado]].

==Background==

Goya witnessed first-hand the French occupation of Spain in 1808, when [[Napoleon]] used the pretext of reinforcing his army in [[Portugal]] to seize the Spanish throne, leaving his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] in power. Attempts to remove members of the Spanish royal family from [[Madrid]] provoked a widespread rebellion. This popular uprising occurred between the second and third of May 1808, when suppressed by forces under Maréchal [[Joachim Murat]].

==The painting==
''The Second of May 1808'' depicts the beginning of the uprising when the [[Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard|Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard]] are ordered to charge and subdue the rioting citizens. The crowd sees the Mamelukes as [[Moors]], provoking an angry response. Instead of dispersing, the crowd turned on the charging Mamelukes, resulting in a ferocious [[melee]].

Goya was probably not present during the actual Charge of the Mamelukes. His supposed presence was first suggested in a book published 40 years after his death, reporting on conversations the author claimed to have had with Goya's gardener.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} His paintings were commissioned in 1814, after the expulsion of Napoleon's army from Spain, by the council governing Spain until the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. He chose to portray the citizens of Madrid as unknown heroes using the crudest of weapons, such as knives, to attack a professional, occupying army. That did not please the king when he returned, so the paintings were not hung publicly until many years (and governments) later.

Goya chose not to paint any single action or to have any single focal point to emphasize the chaos of the drama.

==Influences==
[[File:Ivryrubens.jpg|thumb|''[[Henry IV at the Battle of Ivry]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ([[Uffizi]])]]
Goya's ''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1819&amp;ndash;1823 suggests a familiarity with Rubens' 1636 in the Prado. Kenneth Clark considered ''The Second of May 1808'' an "artistic failure&amp;nbsp;... perhaps he could not shake off the memory of similar compositions by Rubens".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Clark,K. ''Looking at Pictures" 1960, p.127 (apparently on p.&amp;nbsp;127. of 1968 printing)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not he knew copies of the [[The Tiger Hunt|hunts]] and [[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|battles]] [[Alte Pinakothek|in Munich]], at least one original, the ''Battle of Ivry'', was along Goya's Italian itinerary.

==Damage==
In 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], when Madrid was bombed by Nationalist troops, the [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] government  decided to evacuate the paintings from the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]]. A truck carrying Goya's paintings had an accident, and ''The Second of May'' was badly damaged: there were tears and even pieces missing.

A first restoration was carried out in 1941 when the paintings returned to Madrid. A further restoration was completed between 2007 and 2008.

'''''Wayne's World 2''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]] as hosts of a [[public-access television]] [[cable television]] show in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. The film is the sequel to ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), which was adapted from a [[Wayne's World|sketch]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Plot==
[[Rock and roll]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World,'' from an abandoned factory in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. After an [[Aerosmith]] concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets [[Jim Morrison]] and a "weird naked [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert "Waynestock" and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.

Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra, singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.

Tickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of ''[[The Graduate]]''. Meanwhile, Garth has [[stage fright]] during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.

In the dream desert, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come and that all that matters is they tried. They become lost in the desert. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'', driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth stage an ending in which the bands arrive and Waynestock is a success. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to get Cassandra but is not allowed inside.

After the concert, the park is covered with trash and [[Keep America Beautiful|the "weird naked Indian" cries]]. Wayne and Garth begin to remove the litter, promising to clean the entire park.

==Production==
[[Penelope Spheeris]], who directed the [[Wayne's World (film)|first film]] believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=June 16, 2008 |title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery |publisher=ew.com |url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/ |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |quote="I hated that bastard for years," says Spheeris, who believes Myers dissuaded Paramount from hiring her for Wayne's World 2. "But when I saw Austin Powers, I went, 'I forgive you, Mike.'" She pauses, voice choked with emotion. "'You can be moody, you can be a jerk, you can be things that others of us can't be—because you are profoundly talented. And I forgive you.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.

Myers' original script for ''Wayne's World 2'' had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy ''[[Passport to Pimlico]].''  This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to ''Passport to Pimlico''.  Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: "I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melnychuk |first=Mark |date=March 3, 2017 |title=Making Wayne's World 2 was 'traumatic' for director Stephen Surjik |publisher=[[Regina Leader-Post]] |url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/making-waynes-world-2-was-traumatic-for-director-stephen-surjik |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio executive [[Sherry Lansing]] was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he didn't immediately produce a new script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THR Staff |date=April 21, 2017 |title=Why Sherry Lansing Threatened Mike Myers: 'I'll Take Your F—ing House' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-sherry-lansing-threatened-mike-myers-ill-take-your-f-king-house-994864 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Wayne's World 2'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne's World 2': It's Not as Good, but Still Worthy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 11, 1992 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-11/news/mn-255_1_wayne-s-world |first=Rone |last=Tempest |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 61% approval rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in ''Wayne's World 2'' are more hit-and-miss the second time around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world_2/ |title=Wayne's World 2 (1993) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are "impossible to dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 10, 1993 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-2-1993 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |title=Wayne's World 2 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
Although it was intended to be a [[Christmas season]] blockbuster, ''Wayne's World 2'' did not receive the box office intake or positive fan reaction that the first film did. Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. ''Wayne's World 2'' also suffered from competition from other holiday season [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne, Garth Party On at the Box Office Movies: 'Wayne's World' sequel pulls in an estimated $14.2 million to push "Mrs. Doubtfire" into second place.

[[File:Wikipedian-in-Residence Scope Diagram Page 1.png|thumb|The relationship between a Wikipedian in residence and the community. The diagram represents the stakeholders and what each stakeholder provides and receives in a typical Wikipedian in Residence project.]]

A '''Wikipedian in residence''' or '''Wikimedian in residence''' ('''WiR''') is a [[Wikipedia]] editor, a [[Wikipedian]] (or Wikimedian), who accepts a placement with an institution, typically an art gallery, library, archive or museum ([[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]]), [[learned society]], or institute of higher education (such as a university) to facilitate [[Wikipedia editing|Wikipedia entries]] related to that institution's mission, encourage and assist it to release material under open licences, and to develop the relationship between the institution and the Wikimedia community. A Wikipedian in residence generally helps to coordinate Wikipedia-related outreach events between the GLAM and the general public.

Institutions that have hosted a Wikipedian in residence include large institutions like the [[National Library of Wales]], [[British Museum]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], the [[British Library]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[National Library of Norway]], and the [[Federal Archives of Switzerland]] and smaller venues like the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] and [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] in the UK; the [[Palace of Versailles]] in France; the [[Museu Picasso]] in Spain; and in the US, the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]], and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

== Developing interest ==

In 2010, Australian Liam Wyatt became the first Wikipedian in residence when he volunteered at the [[British Museum]] for a period of five weeks.&lt;ref name="Cohen group"&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Venerable British Museum Enlists in the Wikipedia Revolution |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/arts/design/05wiki.html |work = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 5 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/arts/artsspecial/warming-up-to-the-culture-of-wikipedia.html |title = Warming Up to the Culture of Wikipedia |work = The New York Times |date = 19 March 2014 |accessdate = 24 March 2014 |last = Cohen |first = Noam }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the need for Wikipedia to strengthen partnerships with museums to create the most up-to-date and accurate information,&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;{{cite web |title = Museum Hires First Wikipedian-in-Residence |url = http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=49490#middle |work = Inside Indiana Business |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |location = Indianapolis, Indiana |date = 19 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "we are doing the same thing for the same reason, for the same people, in the same medium. Let's do it together." The [[Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] became involved with the program after Wikipedian Lori Phillips volunteered for a GLAM event in 2010,&lt;ref name=Inside /&gt; becoming the second Wikipedian in residence. The third, Benoît Evellin, spent six months at the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Château de Versailles|GLAM Château de Versailles Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona, Spain, and the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] in the United Kingdom were also early adopters of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Museu Picasso|GLAM Museu Picasso Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:GLAM/Derby|GLAM Derby Project page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] expressed interest in the idea, which led to the hiring of Sarah Stierch in July as Wikipedian in Residence.&lt;ref name=Cohen2&gt;{{cite web |last = Cohen |first = Noam |title = Success may be Wikipedia's biggest challenge |url = http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/07/12/success_may_be_wikipedias_biggest_challenge/ |work = [[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate = 27 January 2013 |date = 12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Switzer |first = Cody |url = http://philanthropy.com/blogs/social-philanthropy/wikipedian-in-residence-helps-share-smithsonian-archives/28989 |title = Wikipedian-in-residence helps share Smithsonian archives |work = The Chronicle of Philanthropy |date = 28 July 2011 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Shen |first = Aviva |url = http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2012/04/how-many-women-does-it-take-to-change-wikipedia/ |title = How many women does it take to change Wikipedia? |work = Smithsonian Magazine |date = 4 April 2012 |accessdate = 27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Independent]] |first = Paul |last = Gallagher |title = Wikipedia fires editor who enhanced entries for cash |date = 10 January 2014 |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-fires-editor-who-enhanced-entries-for-cash-9052308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] followed suit and hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks, a student from [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]], who was pursuing a [[master's degree]] in history and archives management, to work at its Archives II location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] |first = Julie |last = Baughman |title = National Archives hires 'Wikipedian in residence' |date = 13 July 2011 |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-07-13/news/bs-md-wikipedia-archives-20110621_1_national-archives-wikipedian-archives-information |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[The Washington Post]] |first = Lisa |last = Rein |title = National Archives hires first 'Wikipedian' |date = 2 June 2011 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/national-archives-hires-first-wikipedian/2011/03/23/AG63MCHH_blog.html |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDevitt-Parks had been editing Wikipedia since 2004 and was hired for this position by [[David Ferriero]].&lt;ref name=Washington/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work = [[Tampa Bay Times]] |title = National Archives appoints a 'Wikipedian' |date = 3 June 2011 |url = http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/national-archives-appoints-a-wikipedian/1173507 |accessdate = 26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 [[Wikimedia UK]] engaged Andy Mabbett, an editor since 2003, as an "Outreach Ambassador" in-residence at the Bristol-based wildlife charity [[Wildscreen]], working on the [[m:ARKive project|ARKive project]].&lt;ref name="Bristol24-7"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristol247.com/2011/09/16/bristol-wikipedians-taught-to-edit-online-encylopaedia-26319/ |title = Bristol 'Wikipedians' taught to edit online encylopaedia |last = Zaba |first = Christina |date = 16 September 2011 |work = Bristol24-7 |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Mabbett has been a Wikipedian in residence at other organisations such as [[the New Art Gallery Walsall]].&lt;ref name="Museums Association"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.museumsassociation.org/museum-practice/wikipedia/17062013-the-new-art-gallery-walsall |title = The New Art Gallery Walsall |last = Brown |first = Julie |date = 17 June 2013 |publisher = Museums Association |accessdate = 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library]] became the first [[Presidential library]] to hire a Wikipedian in residence, when they hired Michael Barera, a master's student at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Kaczmarczyk&gt;{{cite web |last = Kaczmarczyk |first = Jeffrey |title = President Gerald R.

In September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration became the first organisation to employ a permanent full-time Wikipedian in residence when it hired Dominic McDevitt-Parks to join its Office of Innovation in that capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/?p=5179 |title = Breaking New Ground Again |date = 19 September 2013 |publisher = [[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:20151009 145940 HDR.jpg|thumb|Dominic McDevitt-Parks speaking at WikiConference USA 2015 hosted at the [[National Archives Building]]]]

In March 2014, [[Harvard University]] posted a job listing seeking applicants to be their Wikipedian in residence at the [[Houghton Library]].&lt;ref name="Outreach"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence |title = Wikipedian in Residence |work = Outreach Wiki |accessdate = 18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the [[University of Victoria]] Libraries announced that in collaboration with The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences that [[:fr:Christian Vandendorpe|Christian Vandendorpe]] had been named Honorary Resident Wikipedian-in-Residence for the 2014/2015 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ideas-idees.ca/media/media-releases/honorary-resident-wikipedian-professor-christian-vandendorpe |title = Honorary resident Wikipedian: Professor Christian Vandendorpe - Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, more than 100 Wikipedians had taken part in the role,&lt;ref name="Outreach" /&gt; most of whom were paid by either the institution where they work or a Wikimedia-related organization.

== Role and duties ==

The primary role of the Wikipedian-in-Residence is to serve as a liaison between the host institution and the Wikimedia community by assisting with events and training that support the missions of both organisations. Typical duties include  arranging and/or leading training events and [[editathon|editathons;]]&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/british_library_wikipedian/ |title = British Library seeks taxpayer-funded Wikipedia-fiddler |work = [[The Register]] |date = 16 February 2012 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Orlowski |first = Andrew |authorlink = Andrew Orlowski }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22264118 |title = National Library of Scotland recruits 'Wikipedian' |work = [[BBC News]] |date = 24 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing explanations to other staff and members of the public about policies and practice, such as policies about conflict-of-interest; as well as making contributions to articles relevant to the institution's materials and mission, such as articles about significant cultural objects in an organisation's collection.&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bristolwireless.net/2013/04/national-library-of-scotland-seeks-wikipedian-in-residence/ |title = National Library of Scotland seeks Wikipedian in residence |work = Bristol Wireless |date = 18 April 2013 |accessdate = 19 June 2013 |last = Woods |first = Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation ==
While Wikipedia discourages direct paid compensation for article editing and prohibits undisclosed advocacy, Wikipedians in residence are [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest#Wikipedians in residence|permitted to be compensated for work on-wiki]], either by offering credit, stipend or salary, through their sponsoring institutions {{em|provided that}} they adhere to strict guidelines against engaging in public relations or marketing for their institution.

== Reception ==

One such advertised post has been reported positively by others as being a "unique opportunity to help enrich Wikipedia and its sister projects and share with the world... resources and knowledge."&lt;ref name="bristolwireless woods 20130418" /&gt; Conversely, journalist [[Andrew Orlowski]] criticized another advertised post as a waste of government funds.&lt;ref name="theregister orlowski 20120216" /&gt; In 2013, a part-time temporary position was advertised by [[National Library of Scotland]] and was noted as being "the first large-scale partnership" between a Scottish institution and [[Wikimedia UK]].&lt;ref name="bbc 20130424" /&gt; This initiative was followed by [[University of Edinburgh]] where a Wikimedian in residence was appointed in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.studentnewspaper.org/university-of-edinburgh-to-employ-wikimedian-in-residence-web-editor/ |title = University of Edinburgh to employ ‘Wikimedian in Residence’ web editor |last = Ho |first = Amanda |date = 13 October 2015 |website = The Student Newspaper |access-date = 7 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''writer''' is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various [[report]]s and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express [[idea]]s well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1–1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts – such as songwriter – but as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an [[oral tradition]].

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature. Some writers may use [[image]]s (drawing, painting, graphics) or [[multimedia]] to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel prize winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on ''how'' they write (that is, the process they use);&lt;ref name=Nicolson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''why'' they write (that is, their motivation);&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Why I write: thoughts on the practice of fiction|year=c. 1998|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0316102296|editor=Will Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen]], for example, criticised [[John Updike]] for being "exquisitely preoccupied with his own literary digestive processes ..." and his "lack of interest in the bigger postwar, postmodern, socio-technological picture" {{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|title=Franzen on Kraus: Footnote 89|journal=The Paris Review|date=6 September 2013|issue=206|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/category/issue-206/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work.

The term ''writer'' is often used as a synonym of ''author'', although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

==Types==
Writers choose from a range of [[literary genre]]s to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a piece of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] began in the genre of [[travel literature]] and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of [[historical romance]]s, such as [[Georgette Heyer]], invent characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using different names to separate their work. [[Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy Sayers]], for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

He had done for her all that a man could,
And some might say, more than a man should,
Then was ever a flame so recklessly blown out
Or a last goodbye so negligent as this?
‘I will write to you,' she muttered briefly,
Tilting her cheek for a polite kiss;
Then walked away, nor ever turned about.  ...

Long letters written and mailed in her own head –
There are no mails in a city of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;

Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use [[rhyme]] and rhythm and they also exploit the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]. A common theme is love and its vicissitudes. [[Shakespeare]]'s famous love story ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theatres and made into at least eight cinematic versions.&lt;ref&gt;1936, 1954, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1978, 2013, 2014. [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Romeo+and+Juliet&amp;s=all IMDb listing.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====
{{Main|Novelist}}

Novelists write novels – stories that explore universal themes through fiction. They situate invented characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining.
{{Quotation|''Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Stendhal]], [[Eugène Fromentin]], [[Jacques Rivière]], [[Raymond Radiguet|Radiguet]], all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.''&lt;br /&gt;[[François Mauriac]], novelist&lt;ref name="Le Marchand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Marchand|first=Jean|title=Interviews: François Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2|journal=The Paris Review|date=Summer 1953|issue= 2|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5197/the-art-of-fiction-no-2-franois-mauriac|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Satirist====
{{Main|Satire}}

A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of exposing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as [[greed]] are also a common and universal subject. Philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote a satire about optimism called ''[[Candide]]'', which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of [[Absurdism]] in ''Candide'', just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist [[Barry Humphries]], who writes comic satire for his character [[Dame Edna Everage]] to perform on stage.

Satirists use various techniques such as [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], and [[hyperbole]] to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres – the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most famous satirists is [[Jonathan Swift]] who wrote the four-volume work ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and many other satires, including ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.

{{Quotation|''It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Jonathan Swift]], satirist (1704)&lt;ref&gt;The Epistle Dedicatory of ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''. For text at Wikisource, see [[s:A Tale of a Tub|''A Tale of a Tub'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Short story writer====
{{Main|Short story}}
A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
[[File:Wagner Luzern 1868.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Richard Wagner]], who also wrote the libretti for his works]]
{{Main|Libretto}}
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], for example, wrote the libretto for some of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas. [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]] were Italian librettists who wrote for [[Giacomo Puccini]]. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, [[Richard Wagner]] wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
{{Quotation|''Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.''
("Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.")&lt;br /&gt;Rodolpho, in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Rodolpho's aria in Act I of ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lyricist====
{{Main|Lyricist}}
Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing [[lyrics]], the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of [[Tom Lehrer]], these were satirical. Lyricist [[Noël Coward]], who wrote musicals and songs such as "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]" and the recited song "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]", also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original pieces.
{{Quotation|''Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Sondheim]], lyricist&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipton|first=James|title=Interview: Stephen Sondheim, The Art of the Musical|journal=The Paris Review|date=Spring 1997|issue= 142|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1283/the-art-of-the-musical-stephen-sondheim|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Playwright====
[[File:FF The Tempest title.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' from the 1623 [[First Folio]]]]
{{Main|Playwright}}

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell "a story the audience should care about", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2015/november/feature-mike-bartlett-kciii?fptd_mode=validation|title=Mike Bartlett on writing King Charles III|last=Bartlett|first=Mike|date=18 November 2015|website=Sydney Theatre Company Magazine|publisher=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in [[iambic pentameter]] as does [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] in his play ''King Charles III'' (2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] or [[Anton Chekhov]] have had their works adapted many times. The plays of early Greek playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aeschylus]] are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be faithful to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to produce a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the [[filmmaking|cinema]]. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The amendment of the name to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is a play inspired by Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

{{Quotation|'''''Player''''': ''It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Tom Stoppard]], [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]] (Act Two)&lt;ref name=Stoppard&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopppard|first=Tom|title=Rosencrantz and Guildentern Are Dead|year=1967|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-08182-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Screenwriter====
{{Main|Screenwriter}}

Screenwriters write a screenplay – or script – that provides the words for media productions such as films, television programs and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay [[Spec script|speculatively]]; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as [[freelancer]]s and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the great [[Theme (arts)|themes]] and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' is a "play within a play", which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet gains the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing "wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2]]'', (Act II, Sc.2, line 609)&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleplay]] writer [[Joe Menosky]] deploys the same "play within a play" device in an episode of the science fiction [[Television program#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a ''Star Trek'' crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or "patron" as he is called), of the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;See Season 6, Episode 22: [[Muse (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Muse", ''(Star Trek: Voyager)'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speechwriter====
{{Main|Speechwriter}}
A speechwriter prepares the text for a [[Public speaking|speech]] to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like [[Cicero]]; charismatic or influential political leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]]; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====
{{Main|List of biographers}}
Biographers write an account of another person's life. [[Richard Ellmann]] (1918–1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]].

====Critic====
{{Main|Critic}}
Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done – for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Habib|first= M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA, USA; Oxford, UK; Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) and the literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

{{Quotation|''We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends – that is a great thing – and no enemies.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], introducing his Review of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1845&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Baudelaire – Art in Paris 1845–1862: Reviews of Salons and other exhibitions|year=1965|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|page=1|editor = Jonathan Mayne (editor and translator)|chapter=The Salon of 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Editor====
{{Main|Editing|Copywriting}}
[[File:Un Cœur simple (manuscrito).jpg|thumb|Flaubert's heavily edited page of his manuscript for [[Three Tales (Flaubert)#"A Simple Heart"|Un Cœur simple]]]]

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. [[Copy editing|Copy editors]] format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or [[manuscript]]s or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Beverley Ellison|title=Famous Introductions to Shakespeare's Plays by the Notable Editors of the Eighteenth Century (1906)|date = 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=1290807086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text – they may write original material, in particular, editorials; select what is to be included from a range of items on offer; format the material; or check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|Sculpture in Berlin depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great writers: [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; [[Thomas Mann|Mann]]; [[Theodor Fontane|Fontane]]; [[Hermann Hesse|Hesse]]; [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]; [[Heinrich Böll|Böll]]; [[Karl Marx|Marx]]; [[Brothers Grimm]]; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]; [[Anna Seghers|Seghers]]; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; [[Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]; [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]; [[Günter Grass|Grass]] ]]

{{Main|Encyclopedia}}
Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) is renowned for his contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The encyclopaedist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] (1499–1590) was a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] whose ''Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España'' is a vast encyclopedia of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilisation, commonly referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best preserved copy.

====Essayist====
{{Main|List of essayists}}

Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in [[prose]], but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====
{{See also|List of historians}}
A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a historian is to employ [[Historiography|historical analysis]] to create coherent narratives that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, "The Parlous Paths of the Profession" [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s six volume ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' influenced the development of [[historiography]].

====Lexicographer====
{{Main|Lexicography}}
Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), whose ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as [[Jane Austen]].

====Researcher/Scholar====
{{Main|Research|Scholarly method}}
[[File:Chomsky 4 - On the elite's view of the poor.ogg|thumb|left|One of many interviews with prolific American writer, philosopher, linguist, scientist, historian and critic [[Noam Chomsky]] (2009)]]

Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who wrote ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543); [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); and [[Sigmund Freud]], who wrote ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the centre of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of nature; and Freud's ideas about the power of the [[unconscious mind]] overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.&lt;ref name=Weinert&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|title=Copernicus, Darwin and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford UK;|isbn=978-1-4051-8184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translator====
{{Main|Translation}}
Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar]], who translated ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Arabic]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], who deciphered [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with the result that he could publish the first translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or [[pun]]s; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is supposedly untranslatable because "no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses."&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title="Introduction" to the English translation of "Le Grand Meaulnes"|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780141441894|page=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred. 

{{Quotation|''Even if translation is impossible – we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Dessaix]], translator, author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dessaix|first=Robert|title="Dandenongs Gothic: On Translation" in (and so forth)|year=1998|publisher=Pan McMillan Australia Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=0-7329-0943-0|pages=307|authorlink=Robert Dessaix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reportage===

====Blogger====
{{Main|Blog}}
Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the [[World Wide Web]] since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or "posts" form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. [[Malala Yousafzai]], a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence because of her blog for [[BBC]].

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter.  "The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members".&lt;ref name=Rettburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rettberg|first=Jill Walker|title=Blogging|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK; Malden, Massachusetts USA|isbn=978-0-7456-4133-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with other forms of letter, the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that "some of the audience will be random" and "that presumably changes the way we [writers] write."&lt;ref name=Rettburg /&gt; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]], whose ''Essais'' ("attempts"), were published in 1580, because Montaigne "wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation".&lt;ref name=Bakewell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=What Bloggers Owe Montaigne|journal=The Paris Review|date=12 November 2010|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/11/12/what-bloggers-owe-montaigne/|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Columnist====
{{Main|Columnist}}
Columnists write regular pieces for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book, so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the columnist [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
{{Main|List of diarists}}
[[File:Anne Frank signature.svg|thumb|Signature of [[Anne Frank]]]]
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts or feelings in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events or individual personalities. Examples include [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the [[Great Fire of London]]. [[Anne Frank]] (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====
{{Main|Journalism}}
Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is [[Bob Woodward]], a journalist who investigated and wrote about [[Watergate scandal|criminal activities by the US President]].
{{Quotation| ''Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.''&lt;br /&gt;Geoffrey Barker, journalist.&lt;ref name="Barker and de Brito"&gt;Barker and de Brito, controversially lamenting the preference for looks over experience in televised journalism. {{cite news|last=Geoffrey Barker|title=Switch off the TV babes for some real news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/switch-off-the-tv-babes-for-some-real-news-20130501-2it0o.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=May 2, 2013}} {{cite news|last=Sam de Brito|title=Reality's bite worse than Barker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/blogs/all-men-are-liars/realitys-bite-worse-than-barker-20130502-2ivq8.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Memoirist====
{{Main|Memoir}}

Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are deemed unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although intended to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Famous memoirists include [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane]], and [[Giacomo Casanova]].

{{Main|Letter (message)}}
Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to [[Héloïse (abbess)|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] {{nowrap|(1090?–1164)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For text see [[s:Letters of Abélard and Héloïse|Letters of Abélard and Héloïse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters (or [[epistle]]s) of [[Paul the Apostle]] were so influential that over the 2000 years of Christian history, Paul became "second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to St. Paul in the Middle Ages|year=2013|publisher=Koninklijke, Brill, NV|location=Leiden The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-23672-1 |pages=1|editor=Steven R.

It contains notes used later as the basis for his report and all his subsequent narratives.]]

====Report writer====
{{Main|Report}}

Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the [[Crimean War]] and showed her determination to see improvements: "...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her ''Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.'' This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural" became for a long time, the "leading authority on the medical administration of armies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=Lytton|title=[[Eminent Victorians]]|year=1918|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=0-14-000649-4|pages=142–3|edition=1981|authorlink=Lytton Strachey|chapter=Florence Nightingale – 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British army : founded chiefly on the experience of the late war|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/notes-on-matters-affecting-the-health-efficiency-and-hospital-administration-of-the-british-army-founded-chiefly-on-the-experience-of-the-late-war/oclc/7660327|work=Adelaide Nutting historical nursing collection, AN 0054.|publisher=London : Harrison and Sons, 1858|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logs and reports of [[Master mariner]] [[William Bligh]] contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the [[court-martial]] inquiring into the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}}.

====Scribe====
[[File:The Letter Writer.jpg|thumb|Scribe in India taking instructions from a client]]
{{Main|Scribe}}

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recording]], [[shorthand]], or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from classical times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and "found manuscripts in places like [[Tours]] and [[Toulouse]]" which they copied.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Civilisation|year=1969|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-016589-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colours.

====Technical writer====
{{Main|Technical writer}}

A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as [[user guide]]s or [[owner's manual]]s for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write various procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant [[style guide]].

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at his manuscript burning]]
{{main|Writing process}}
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.&lt;ref name=Older&gt;{{cite news|last1=Older|first1=Daniel José|title=Writing Begins With Forgiveness: Why One of the Most Common Pieces of Writing Advice Is Wrong|url=http://sevenscribes.com/writing-begins-with-forgiveness-why-one-of-the-most-common-pieces-of-writing-advice-is-wrong/|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of [[photocopier]]s and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very early times, writers used [[vellum]] and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the inventor of [[Esperanto]], whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that "his son would be thought a spy working code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;– The English Language|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], lost the only copy of a manuscript for ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles William, Ed. "Introductory Note" in ''The Harvard Classics'', Vol. XXV, Part 3. New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son, 1909–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers usually develop a personal schedule. [[Angus Wilson]], for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Angus|title=Interview with Angus Wilson|journal=The Paris Review|year=1957|issue=Autumn-Winter No.17|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4848/the-art-of-fiction-no-20-angus-wilson|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writer's block]] is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

{{Quotation|''Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page''&lt;br /&gt;[[Gustave Flaubert]] writing to [[Louise Colet]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Plate caption to an image of a much-corrected page of [[Madame Bovary]] in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Rouen. In {{cite book|last=Brown|first=Frederick|title=Flaubert: a biography|year=2006|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|location=New York|isbn=9780316118781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Leonid Pasternak - The Passion of creation.jpg|thumb|left|''Throes of Creation'' by [[Leonid Pasternak]] ]]

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. "Didn't [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] also write facing a blank wall? ... [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point."&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Ted Hughes|Hughes]]|first=Ted|title=Ted Hughes: The Art of Poetry No. 71|journal=The Paris Review|year=1995|volume=Spring|issue= 134|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that multiple authors write and contribute to a piece of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the piece too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Librettist [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote the words for the [[comic opera]]s created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most famous example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King [[James VI and I|James VI]] of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in [[Cambridge]] and some in [[Oxford]], who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]], published in 1611, has been described as an "everlasting miracle" because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to "hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king", with the result that the language communicates itself "in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another."&lt;ref name=Nicolson2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}(p.240, 243)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multimedia====
[[File:William Blake Nurses Song Copy Z 1826.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]] "[[Nurse's Song]]" from ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]
Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. [[William Blake]] is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. [[Cartoonist]]s are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. [[Shaun Tan]], for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Shaun|title=The Oopsatoreum|year=2012|publisher=Powerhouse Publishing|location=Sydney|isbn=9781863171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's writers [[Beatrix Potter]], [[May Gibbs]], and [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]] are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
Some writers contribute very small sections to a piece of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', under the editorship of lexicographer [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of [[William Chester Minor|W.C. Minor]], at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.&lt;ref name=Crowthorne&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester|title=[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words]]|year=1998|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0670878626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia which relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteer writers and editors worldwide, such as [[Simon Pulsifer]].&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Simon Pulsifer: The Duke of Data|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570732,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression&lt;ref name=Styron&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton|title=William Styron, The Art of Fiction No. 5|url= http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5114/the-art-of-fiction-no-5-william-styron|journal=The Paris Review|year=1954|issue=Spring|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording facts, history or research results. The many [[physician writer]]s, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the [[human condition]] with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, [[George Orwell]]'s essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to "what constitutes success or failure to a writer", it has been described as "a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part".&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jane|title=JK Rowling on turning failure into success|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/jk-rowling-on-turning-failure-into-success-20141219-129vm6.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.''&lt;br /&gt;[[W. Somerset Maugham]] in ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919)&lt;ref name=Maugham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maugham|first1=Somerset|title=The Moon and Sixpence|date=1999|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099284765|page=8|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s order at the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. [[Philology|Philologist]] [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

{{Quotation| ''For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Fry]], author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=The Ode Less Travelled – Unlocking the Poet Within|year=2007|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-950934-9|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, many comics and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''I think that I shall never see''
''a billboard lovely as a tree;''
''Indeed, unless the billboards fall''
''I'll never see a tree at all.''

====Influence====
[[File:Ninety-Five Theses, Wittenberg.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' (at the All Saints' Church, [[Wittenburg]])]]
Anger has motivated many writers, including [[Martin Luther]], angry at religious corruption, who wrote the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' in 1517, to reform the church, and [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'Accuse]]'' in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

}}

Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an old one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. [[Frances Milton Trollope|Frances Trollope]] is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in America, called ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' became a great success, "even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life" after which "she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast".&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Katherine|title=Victorian Wives|year=1974|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London, New York|isbn=0-85031-634-0|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her writer son [[Anthony Trollope]] "her books saved the family from ruin".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

{{Quotation| ''I write for two reasons; partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect.''&lt;br /&gt;[[E. M. Forster]], novelist, essayist, librettist&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Quoted in the introduction to the author in the 1962 edition of {{cite book|last=E.M. Forster|title=[[Aspects of the Novel]]|year=1927|publisher=Penguin|authorlink=E. M. Forster}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Teach====
[[Aristotle]], who was tutor to [[Alexander the Great]], wrote to support his [[education|teaching]]. He wrote two [[treatise]]s for the young prince: "On Monarchy", and "On Colonies"&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of Alexandria|year=2000|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=Cairo, Egypt|isbn=977-424-710-8|pages=79–91|author=R.G. Tanner|chapter=Aristotle's Works: The Possible Origins of the Alexandria Collection|editor=Roy MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[dialogue]]s also appear to have been written either "as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] between 334 and 323 BC."&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt; They encompass both his 'scientific' writings ([[metaphysics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], as well as [[logic]] and [[argument]]) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, [[Public speaking|oratory]], ethics, and politics), and "major elements in traditional [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] education".&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt;

Writers of [[textbook]]s also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech "in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization" and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.&lt;ref name=Dowis&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowis|first=Richard|title=The Lost Art of the Great Speech: How to Write One : How to Deliver It|year=2000|publisher=AMA publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8144-7054-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]; [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]; [[Doris Lessing]]; [[Toni Morrison]]; [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]; and [[Patrick White]].
Writers such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Herta Müller]], and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Woo a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals.  [[Edmond Rostand]]'s play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.

==Authorship==
[[File:Autographe de Marianne Alcoforado (Maria Anna Alcoforada), comme écrivain du couvent de Béja.jpg|thumb|Signature of [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Maria Anna Alcoforada), once thought to be the writer of the [[Epistolary novel|epistolary fiction]], ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]''. ]]

===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or "nom de plume". The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular ethnicity); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: [[George Eliot]] (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; [[George Orwell]] (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; [[George Sand]] (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; [[Dr. Seuss]] (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle and [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to "Anonymous", there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like ''Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'' (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by "Anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers (published pre-1923)|year=2010 |publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781142479084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawton.org/ Chawton House Library | Home to early English women's writing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CumaeanSibylByMichelangelo.jpg|thumb|Cumaean Sibyl by [[Michelangelo]]]]

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's ''[[Middlemarch]]'', and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and drive significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. [[Robinson Crusoe]] is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer ([[Daniel Defoe]]) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. [[Bridget Jones]] is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Both works became famous and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The ''[[Sibylline Books]]'', a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===
[[File:Ethiopian - John the Evangelist - Walters W850153V - Open Reverse.jpg|thumb| [[John the Evangelist]] Ethiopian c. 1540]]
[[Religious text]]s or scriptures are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]], while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==
[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] c. 1513 ''Old Man with water studies''. In the [[Royal Librarian (United Kingdom)|Royal Library, Windsor]]. Thought to be a self-portrait, showing Leonardo's writing and drawing.]]
Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Leonardo "had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form". He used "left-handed or mirror writing" (a technique described as "so characteristic of him") to protect his scientific research from other readers.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite book|title="Leonardo's Manuscripts" in Leonardo de Vinci|publisher=Reynal and Company, in association with William Morris and Company|location=New York|pages=157|edition=Authoritative work, published in Italy by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, in conjunction with exhibition of Leonardo's work in Milan in 1938 (re-edited English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public "wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue".&lt;ref name="Wilson &amp; Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Scandal!: An Explosive Exposé of the Affairs, Corruption and Power Struggles of the Rich and Famous|year=2011|publisher=Random House|author2=Damon Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist [[D H Lawrence]] challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as [[Norma Khouri]] or [[Helen Darville]] who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet [[Paul Verlaine]] outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the [[Marquis de Sade]] who offended the public both by his writings ''and'' by his behaviour.

===Punishment===

The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The [[list of journalists killed in Russia]] is an example. Others include:
* The [[Balibo Five]], a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975.
* [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' and was hanged for his resistance to [[Nazism]].
* [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* [[Günter Grass]] (1927–2015), whose poem "[[What Must Be Said]]" led to his being declared ''[[persona non grata]]''  in [[Israel]].
* [[Peter Greste]] (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was "damaging to national security."&lt;ref name=bbc-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25546389 |title=Egypt crisis: Al-Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo |work=BBC News |date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Primo Levi]] (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called ''[[If This Is a Man]]''.
* [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for [[heresy]] as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of [[heliocentrism]], although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to [[house arrest]].
* [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who "successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges" and was given "the choice between [[castration]] or execution." He "became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities."&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book|last=Battles|first=Matthew|title=Library – An Unquiet History|year=2003|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-00887-7}}p40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947), whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' was banned and burned internationally after causing [[The Satanic Verses controversy|such a worldwide storm]] that a [[Fatwa|fatwā]] was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* [[Roberto Saviano]] (born 1979), whose best-selling book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]'' provoked the Neapolitan [[Camorra]], annoyed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and ''[[Cancer Ward]]''—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the [[Union of Soviet Writers|USSR Union of Writers]].
* [[William Tyndale]] ({{Circa|1494}} – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.
* [[Simon Sheppard (activist)|Simon Sheppard]] (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for expressing controversial opinions on race and the Holocaust.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation [[Reporters Without Borders]] (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in [[Australian Writers' Guild|Australia]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and unions in [[Arab Writers Union|Arabia]], [[Writers Union of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers|Azerbaijan]], [[Writers' Union of Canada|Canada]], [[Estonian Writers' Union|Estonia]], [[Hungarian Writers' Union|Hungary]], [[Irish Writers' Union|Ireland]], [[Moldovan Writers' Union|Moldova]], [[Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas|Philippines]], [[Polish Writers' Union|Poland]], [[Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois|Québéc]], [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romania]], [[Union of Russian Writers|Russia]], [[Sudanese Writers Union|Sudan]], and the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In the United States, there is both a [[Writers Guild of America|writers guild]] and a [[National Writers Union]].

==Awards==

There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many [[literary award]]s given by individual countries, such as the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]], as well as international awards such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Russian writer [[Boris Pasternak]] (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.
