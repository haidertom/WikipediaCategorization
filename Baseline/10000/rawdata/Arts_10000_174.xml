==History==
In 1911, [[Frederic Goudy]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]], and [[William Addison Dwiggins|W. A. Dwiggins]] came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madmuseum.org/series/aiga|title=AIGA|website=madmuseum.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, president of the [[National Arts Club]], [[John G. Agar (lawyer)|John G. Agar]], announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/11/13/104788833.html|title=ARTS CLUB WARNED OF 'THOUGHT TRUST'; While It Plans for Graphic Arts, Bacheller Also Warns of Our Europeanization. NEW THEMES FOR NOVELS Getting Away from Work, He Finds Butcher's Daughter Cultivates Only Ease and the Graces Now.|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee formed included [[Charles DeKay]] and [[William Bailey Howland|William B. Howland]] and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aiga.org/How-Our-Quarter-Century-Began/|title=How Our Quarter Century Began|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howland, publisher and editor of ''The Outlook'', was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Heller|author2=Nathan Gluck|title=Seventy-five years of AIGA|url=http://www.aiga.org/about-history-75thanniversary/|website=aiga.org|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1920, AIGA began awarding [[List of AIGA medalists|medals]] to "individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design." Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aiga.org/medal|title=AIGA Medalists List|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Represented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Corporate Records|url=http://corp.dcra.dc.gov/BizEntity.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityld=2787251|publisher=The District of Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbol sign project==
{{main article|DOT pictograms}}
The AIGA, in collaboration with the [[US Department of Transportation]], produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs "in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving  a [[Presidential Design Award]]. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs|title=Symbol Signs|year=2009|publisher=AIGA|accessdate=September 2, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010215420/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/symbol-signs| archivedate= October 10, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual competitions ==

===Cased===
In 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called "Cased"&lt;ref name="Cased-competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/cased/|title=Cased, AIGA's annual design competition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly called "Justified"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/justified/#about |title=Justified: AIGA Annual Design Competition |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate "the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies".&lt;ref name="Cased-competition" /&gt;

===50 Books/50 Covers===
Between 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled "50 Books/50 Covers". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as [[George Salter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Books of the year 1963'', The American Institute of Graphic Arts, New York, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by [[Design Observer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/AIGA-and-Design-Observer-partner-on-50-Books-50-Covers/ |title=AIGA and Design Observer Partner on "50 Books/50 Covers" |date=February 17, 2012 |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move has been criticized.&lt;ref name=Unjustified&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.printmag.com/featured/aiga-unjustified/ |title=AIGA: Unjustified |first=Paula |last=Scher |authorlink=Paula Scher |work=[[Print (magazine)|Print Magazine]] |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===365===
The 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design.&lt;ref name=Unjustified /&gt; The last “365” competition was organized in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/about-365/ |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;365 | Design Effectiveness Competition&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author=AIGA |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was replaced by the "Cased" competition.

==Conferences==
AIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designconference.aiga.org/#!/|title=AIGA Design Conference|website=designconference.aiga.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIGA Design Conference===

The first AIGA Design Conference took place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985.

'''''And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic''''' is a 1987 book by ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalist [[Randy Shilts]]. The book chronicles the discovery and spread of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically [[gay]] disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease is caused by a biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.

The book is an extensive work of investigative journalism, written in the form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the [[epidemic]] are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of [[Grethe Rask]], a Danish doctor working in [[Africa]]. He ends with the announcement by actor [[Rock Hudson]] in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.

''And the Band Played On'' was critically acclaimed and became a best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the ''[[Library Journal]]'' called it "one of the most important books of the year", upon its release.&lt;ref name="eannarino"&gt;Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved."&lt;ref name="geiger"&gt;{{cite news | first=H Jack | last=Geiger | title= Plenty of Blame to Go Around | date= 1987-11-08 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/books/plenty-of-blame-to-go-around.html | work =The New York Times Book Review | page = 9 | accessdate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later adapted into an [[And the Band Played On (film)|HBO film of the same name]] in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.

| quote = To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that...it was never something that happened to those other people. —[[Randy Shilts]] in 1983}}

Shilts decided to write ''And the Band Played On'' after attending an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer [[Bill Kurtis]] gave the keynote address and told a joke: "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're [[Haiti]]an."&lt;ref&gt;p. 384, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go in front of a journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people."&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt;

After publication of the book, Shilts explained his use of the title: "''And the Band Played On'' is simply a snappier way of saying 'business as usual'. Everyone responded with an ordinary pace to an extraordinary situation."&lt;ref name="engel"&gt;Engel, Margaret. "AIDS and Prejudice: One Reporter's Account of the Nation's Response." ''The Washington Post'', December 1, 1987, p. Z10.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is originally from [[The Temptations]]' popular 1970 song about encroaching chaos, ''[[Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)]]''; in the song, the phrase repeatedly signals that no one is paying proper attention to world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/The-temptations-ball-of-confusion-thats-what-the-world-is-today-lyrics|title=Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today) (lyrics by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong|website=Genius.com|date=2 April 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Shilts focuses on several organizations and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and were given the task of finding the cause of the disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an [[Third-person omniscient narrative|omniscient point of view]] to portray individuals' thoughts and feelings.

===Gay community===
AIDS in the United States first struck gay men and [[intravenous drug use (recreational)|IV drug users]] in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay community tried to remember the last time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebration in 1976, when sailors came from all over the world to New York.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 142–143 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them carried [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: "Before" in 1980, and "After" by 1985. "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;p. 12, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; "After" signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 585–590, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, particularly in the Castro District, gay community activists such as [[Bill Kraus]] and [[Cleve Jones]] found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 38–40, 154–155 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 152–154, 167, 180, 200, 209–210, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, men like [[Larry Kramer]] and [[Paul Popham]], who had previously shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] to raise money for medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with [[opportunistic infections]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 133–134, 166–167, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor [[Ed Koch]] and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and [[sex education|preventive education]] about AIDS and [[unsafe sex]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 309–311, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

In these cities, however, the sizable gay communities in most instances were responsible for raising the most money for research, providing the money for and subsequently the social services for the dying, and educating themselves and other high-risk groups. Kramer would go on to form [[ACT UP|AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT-UP), a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;"Larry Kramer."

Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones formed the [[NAMES Project]] that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest folk art display in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Cleve Jones."

===Medical community===
Doctors were the first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like [[Marcus Conant]], James Curran, [[Arye Rubenstein]], [[Michael S. Gottlieb]], and [[Mathilde Krim]]—would also realize their professional life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably [[lymphadenopathy]], [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]], [[Kaposi's Sarcoma]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[cryptosporidia]], and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised [[immune system]]. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 150, 321–322, 374–375 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts praised the Public Health Department of San Francisco's handling of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although some of them were living in different parts of the country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director [[David Sencer]] refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;p. 310, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time gay men were getting sick in the United States, doctors in Paris were receiving patients who were African or who had lived in Africa with the same symptoms as the Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi|Françoise Barre]], [[Luc Montagnier]], and doctor [[Willy Rozenbaum]] began taking biopsies of HIV-infected [[lymph nodes]] and discovered a new [[retrovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 219, 229, 237–238, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the [[Pasteur Institute]] sent a colleague to the [[National Cancer Institute]], where [[Robert Gallo]] was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 238, 239–240, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 264, 386–388, 401, 409, 418–420 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Departmental ego and pride, according to Shilts, also confounded research as the [[Centers for Disease Control]] and the [[National Cancer Institute]]s battled over funding and who might get credit for medical discoveries that were to come from the isolation of HIV, blood tests to find HIV, or any possible [[vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 429–430, 434–435, 444–445, 447–448, 450–452, 460–462, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Once AIDS became known as a "gay disease" there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were not gay, such as infants born from drug-using mothers,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 103–104, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; children and adults who had [[hemophilia]] (and later, their wives),&lt;ref&gt;pp.115–116, 160–161, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]]ans,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 124, 135–136, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; and people who had received [[blood transfusions]].

The discovery of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by [[blood bank]] leadership occurred as early as 1982,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 195, 220–223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was not until 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 307–309, 332–333, 344–346, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for [[hepatitis]] alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;p. 223, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and governmental agencies===
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the agency responsible for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy in the face of mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.&lt;ref&gt;pp.292–293, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Reagan Administration officials like [[Health and Human Services]] Secretary [[Margaret Heckler]] and Assistant Secretary [[Edward Brandt]] spoke publicly about the epidemic, calling it in 1983 its "Number One Health Priority" no extra funding was given to the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health for research.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 293–4 ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; What the U.S. Congress pushed through was highly politicized and embattled, and a fraction of what was spent on similar public health problems.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 294–298, 363–364, 455–456, 471–472, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts made comparisons to the government's disparate reaction to the [[Chicago Tylenol murders]], and the recent emergence of [[Legionnaire's Disease]] in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting [[cyanide]]-laced [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] capsules. The ''New York Times'' wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] employees worked on the case. [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] disclosed they spent $100&amp;nbsp;million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The ''New York Times'' wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;p. 191 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the [[American Legion]] died in 1976 at a convention in [[Philadelphia]]. The [[National Institute of Health]] spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;p. 186 And the Band Played On.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of neglecting to address AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson to tell him to get well.&lt;ref&gt;p. 588, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.&lt;ref&gt;587–598, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

On a civic level, the closure of [[gay bathhouse]]s in San Francisco became a bitter political fight in the gay community. Activists put pressure on the San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 153–154, 305–307, 314–317, 413–418, 436–439, 440–443, 481–482, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt;

===News media===
Shilts was assigned to AIDS full-time at ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' in 1982. It was from this unique vantage point that he repeatedly criticized the U.S. [[news media]] for ignoring the medical crisis because it did not affect people who mattered, only gays and drug addicts.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name='Story in Closet'&gt;Shilts, Randy (August 3, 1985). [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/04/MNAIDS04SHILTS1.DTL&amp;hw=The+Story+in+the+Closet&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 "The Story in the Closet"] ''San Francisco Chronicle'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Shilts noted most newspapers would print stories about AIDS only when it affected heterosexuals, sometimes taking particular interest in stories about AIDS in [[prostitutes]]. AIDS was not reported in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' until it involved heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;p. 137, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stories called AIDS a "gay plague" or "homosexual disease" in articles that pointed to it showing up in new populations, like [[hemophiliacs]] or people who had received blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 353–354, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts recounted the irony of a reporter commenting on how little was reported about the disease, then linking it once more to rarer instances of transmission to non-drug-using heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 110, 183, 213, 267–268, 320 ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other end of the extreme, a general [[phobia]] of AIDS was exacerbated by the news media who erroneously reported that AIDS could be contracted by household contact, without checking any facts in their stories, which prompted mass hysteria across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 299–301, 320–321, ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The book became a commercial success, contrary to Shilts' own expectations.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt; It remained on the ''[[New York Times Bestseller List]]'' for five weeks, was translated into seven languages, nominated for a [[National Book Award]], and made Shilts an "AIDS celebrity".&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;Grimes, William (February 18, 1994). [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/obituaries/randy-shilts-author-dies-at-42-one-of-first-to-write-about-aids.html "Randy Shilts, Author, Dies at 42; One of First to Write About AIDS"] ''The New York Times'', p. D.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Shilts is compared to great American writers whose careers were made by the circumstances surrounding them, such as [[Thomas Paine]] in the [[American Revolution]], [[Edward R. Murrow]] during [[the Blitz]], and [[David Halberstam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Writer Jon Katz explains, "No other mainstream journalist has sounded the alarm so frantically, caught the dimensions of the AIDS tragedy so poignantly or focused so much attention on government delay, the nitpickings of research funding and institutional intrigue".&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;Katz, Jon (May 27, 1993). "AIDS and the Media: Shifting Out of Neutral", ''Rolling Stone'', Issue 657, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', Howard Merkel characterizes ''And the Band Played On'' as the first volume of the [[historiography]] of AIDS.&lt;ref name="merkel"&gt;Merkel, Howard (July 2001). "Journals of the Plague Years: Documenting the History of the AIDS Epidemic in the United States", ''American Journal of Public Health'', '''91''' (7), p. 1025.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the content expanded into law and science, reviews were published not only in literary sources but legal and medical journals as well.

===Literary===
Literary reviews of the work were generally positive, with reviewers commenting on the "hypnotic" and "thriller-like" qualities of the book. Shilts' investigative and journalistic endeavors were praised, and reviewers seemed genuinely moved by the personal stories of the major players.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Judith Eannarino noted, "Shilts has the ability to draw the reader hypnotically into the personal lives of his characters. That, and his monumental investigative effort, would have made this a best-selling novel—if the contents weren't so horribly true."(Eannarino, Judith (November 15, 1987). "And the Band Played On (book review)." ''Library Journal'' '''112''' (19) p. 71.) A reviewer with the feminist magazine ''Hera'' agreed, saying, "''And the Band Played On'' reads like a mystery thriller. The fact that it is non-fiction adds to the intensity but also increases the rage the reader is left with."(Johnston, Peg. "And The Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic; A Review of the book by Randy Shilts." ''Hera''. March 31, 1989. '''9''' (2), p. 3.) Elena Brunet in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "An important, masterful piece of investigative reporting".(Brunet, Elena. "And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times'': October 2, 1988. p. 14.) Anthony Clare in ''[[The Times]]'' stated in a review, "''And the Band Played On'' is a formidable chronicle of wasted time, petty intrigue, bigoted posturing, blind faith and suffering", before warning the United Kingdom their response to AIDS was drawing too close a parallel to the United States'.(Clare, Anthony. "Chronicle of many deaths foretold: Review of 'And The Band Played On' by Randy Shilts", ''The Times'', February 28, 1988.) Joan Breckenridge in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the book high praise for "an excellent piece of both investigative and political journalism", and for the style of writing, although cautioning that at more than 600 pages casual readers might be overwhelmed.(Breckenridge, Joan. "The awful epidemic that was allowed to happen: And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic." ''The Globe and Mail (Canada)'', December 5, 1987.) Nan Goldberg in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' characterized it as a, "groundbreaking book on the history of the AIDS epidemic...every element of a thriller." (Goldeberg, Nan. "''Science Big Shot: Passion, Politics, and the Struggle for an AIDS Vaccine'' (book review)." ''The Boston Globe'', January 6, 2002.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''And the Band Played On'' won the [[Stonewall Book Award]] for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. {{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |title=The Stonewall Book Award website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407193541/http://www.ala.org/ala/glbtrt/stonewall/stonewallbook.htm |archivedate=2007-04-07 }} Retrieved on December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It earned the 10th spot on "100 Lesbian and Gay Books That Changed Our Lives", compiled by the ''Lambda Book Report''.&lt;ref&gt;Monteagudo, Jesse. "100 lesbian and gay books that changed our lives." '' Lambda Book Report''; January 2000. Vol. 8, Iss. 6; p. 12, 2 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, The [[New York City Public Library]] topped its list of "21 New Classics for the 21st Century" with ''And the Band Played On''.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael. "NY Librarians Pick 21 New Classics." ''Library Journal'', 10/01/99, Vol. 124 Issue 16, p18, 2p&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after it was published however, Shilts remained "fundamentally disappointed" when a radical response to the AIDS crisis did not materialize, despite the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 book review, Jack Geiger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the detail in Shilts' work was too confusing, being told "in five simultaneous but disjointed chronologies, making them all less coherent", and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users, their partners and their children as to gay men. Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying.&lt;ref name="geiger"/&gt; Woodrow Myers from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far too many of us stop: We don't ask why the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the entitlements like [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the [[multiple sclerosis]] patients are not."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Woodrow. "AIDS: A Reporter's Journey Into the Maelstrom AND THE BAND PLAYED ON by Randy Shilts." ''Los Angeles Times''. Los Angeles, California: December 6, 1987. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gay Community News'' in [[Boston]] also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Kyper, John. "Stories from the epidemic: Two important books about the impact of AIDS." ''Gay Community News''. Boston: September 21, 1991. Vol. 19, Iss. 9; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Rouilard, editor of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1992 criticized Shilts for being out of touch with the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gay Journalists Hold First Conference Media: Delegates assess progress being made against newsroom hostility and the battles that remain." ''Los Angeles Times'': June 28, 1992. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and law===
Shilts' book has been used as a standard by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including [[breast cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolotin, Susan. "Slash, Burn and Poison (book review).'' The New York Times'', April 13, 1997, Sunday, Section 7; Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic fatigue syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Chronic Fatigue Cover-Up?" ''Newsweek'', April 22, 1996, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Orange]],&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Charles. "Waiting for an Army to Die: The Tragedy of Agent Orange by Fred A. Wilcox." ''Los Angeles Times'': December 17, 1989. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and continued response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Biemiller, Lawrence. "Book World; A Clinical Look at Life With AIDS." ''The Washington Post'': April 2, 1993. p. D.02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randal, Judith. "Reality Check; Fighting AIDS in the Trenches." ''The Washington Post'': February 9, 1993. p. Z.19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the ''American Journal of Public Health'', notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing "A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers".&lt;ref name="merkel"/&gt; Jon Katz in ''Rolling Stone'' refutes this by stating "[Shilts] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing so, he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal".&lt;ref name="katz"/&gt;

Although Sandra Panem in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' praised Shilts' efforts and the attention the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight to the issue of [[homophobia]] hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.&lt;ref name="panem"&gt;Panem, Sandra (February 26, 1988). "Review: A Drama and Questions", ''Science'' '''239''' (4843), pp. 1039–1040.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Parmet, a professor at [[Northeastern University Law School]], highlights the greatest strengths of ''And the Band Played On'' to be "the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS" and how it "eloquently portrays the human side of the crisis" and believes the blame others criticized to be justified; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness, suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Parmet, Wendy (1986). "AIDS and the Law/And the Band Played on (Book)", ''[[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]]'', '''12''' (3/4), p. 503–510.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'', Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts' narrative method into question, and ask why, for a syndrome that affects people beyond race, class, and sexual orientation, that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality. The writers, however, were mostly impressed with the book, calling it an "informative, often brilliant, overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic".&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Peter and Stein, Terry (May 1989). "On the Social Meanings of AIDS", Contemporary Sociology '''18''' (3), p. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts is often quoted as claiming that Ronald Reagan neglected to mention AIDS publicly until 1987. However, Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1985 |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm |title=The President's News Conference: September 17, 1985, Federal Support for AIDS Research |publisher=www.reagan.utexas.edu/ |accessdate=2009-01-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221094807/http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/91785c.htm| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaëtan Dugas as "Patient Zero"===
The book includes extensive discussion of [[Gaëtan Dugas]], a Canadian flight attendant who died in 1984.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Dugas was labeled [[Index case|Patient Zero]] of AIDS, because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the United States, and after he was told of his ability to infect others, defiantly continued to have unprotected sex. Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas, or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior. Some reviewers interpreted Shilts' naming Dugas "Patient Zero" to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America; the ''[[National Review]]'' called Dugas the "Columbus of AIDS" and in their review of ''And the Band Played On'' states, "[Dugas] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans. Traveling on his airline-employee privileges, he spread it here from coast to coast."&lt;ref&gt;"The Columbus of AIDS", ''The National Review'' (November 6, 1987), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts never stated this in the book, instead writing, "Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable&amp;nbsp;... there's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other."&lt;ref&gt;p. 439, ''And the Band Played On''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' titled its review of ''And the Band Played On'' "The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero", erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Henry III, William A. (October 19, 1987). "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965791,00.html The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero]", ''Time''. Retrieved on May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a press release by St. Martin's Press made the connection between Dugas and the introduction of AIDS to the Western World in its title, but not its text.&lt;ref name="crimp"&gt;Crimp, Douglas (Winter, 1987). "How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic." ''AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism'' '''43''' pp. 237–271&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was released, Dugas' story became a controversial subject in the Canadian media. Shilts claimed that "the Canadian press went crazy over the story" and that "Canadians... saw it as an offense to their nationhood."&lt;ref name="engel"/&gt; The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by [[William Darrow]], but it was called into question by [[University of California San Francisco]] epidemiologist Andrew Moss. Moss wrote in a letter to the editor of ''The New York Review of Books'', "There is very little evidence that Gaetan was 'patient zero' for the US or for California," while also stating that Shilts did not overstress Dugas' lack of personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Moss AR |year=1988 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4227 |title= 'AIDS without end' |journal= New York Review of Books |volume=35 |issue=19 |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Panem in ''Science'' uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his "glib" treatment of the science involved in the epidemic.&lt;ref name="panem"/&gt; Author [[Douglas Crimp]] suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as "murderously irresponsible" is in actuality "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that [Shilts], like them, is horrified by such creatures."&lt;ref name="crimp"/&gt; Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.&lt;ref name=patzer&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/story/169885-aids/ The Cell That Started a Pandemic], ''Radiolab.org'', with guests and research from: [[Nathan Wolf]] author of ''[[The Viral Storm]]''; [[Carl Zimmer]], author of ''[[A Planet of Viruses]]''; [[Michael Worobey]], [[MicrobeWorld.org]]'s "Meet the Scientist Podcast"; [[David Quammen]], author of ''[[Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic|Spillover]]''; [[Beatrice H. Hahn]] of [[Penn Center for AIDS Research]].&lt;/ref&gt; Even the labelling of Dugas as "Patient Zero" was due to an misunderstanding of the study of sexual contacts amongst a group of men indicating how the disease was transmitted – he was identified in the study as ‘Patient [letter] O’, for "Out of California" – but people reading and discussing the research began referring to and thinking about a "Patient Zero" as the origin of the disease.&lt;ref name="lrb"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crewe |first1=Tom |title=Here was a plague |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n18/tom-crewe/here-was-a-plague |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=London Review of Books |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study of early AIDS cases demonstrated that Dugas could not have been "Patient Zero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature19827.epdf?ttreferrer_access_token=z0xXoLXHonkirkD_hU1jk9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mz5UkminhxQD8O3RqOtslw0uWnC8Yne3mUv32VmwjGPypGuqJT0TZeiLtsZb49IGRJf6V-wefqs5PWP2Zmz2neUNsKL8cH6Lgl4duhbwVFyGFyS_SpnROTz0ii2YbTD4zpYNY1EMUO0FYZn3LyRxi7Fe0SDLem4hpc01XbTdxF3DGYFAjTFX9jLdruf-bmalV8a5l6t-H_6eyTj_nm19jRIZfwaNR5Mx_RBGKhkHJUzg_Q5pw84M70ucJLf_WneW0=&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com|title=1970s and ‘Patient 0’ HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America|first1=Michael|last1=Worobey|first2=Thomas D.|last2=Watts|first3=Richard A.|last3=McKay|first4=Marc A.|last4=Suchard|first5=Timothy|last5=Granade|first6=Dirk E.|last6=Teuwen|first7=Beryl A.|last7=Koblin|first8=Walid|last8=Heneine|first9=Philippe|last9=Lemey|first10=Harold W.|last10=Jaffe|date=26 October 2016|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=539|issue=7627|pages=98–101|accessdate=23 July 2018|doi=10.1038/nature19827|pmc=5257289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After publication==
While Shilts was writing the book he was tested for HIV but insisted his doctor not tell him the results until the book was finished so it would not affect his journalistic integrity and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Bettijane (February 17, 1993). "Shilts Confirms He Is HIV-Positive", ''Los Angeles Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; On the day he sent the final manuscript to the publisher, he learned he was HIV-positive. He also revealed that he received abuse from gays for the articles he wrote for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' supporting the bathhouse closures, as well as for ''And the Band Played On'', saying it was common for him to be spat upon in the Castro District.&lt;ref&gt;Kirka, Danica. "Randy Shilts Fighting Against the Rules Restricting Gays in the Military;" ''Los Angeles Times'': July 25, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was openly booed when he attended the premiere of ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]''—based on his book ''The Mayor of Castro Street''—at the [[Castro Theatre]]. Footage he had shot as a television reporter was included in the film, but during the construction of the documentary he was so controversial that the film's editors removed him from footage showing him with Milk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of ''And the Band Played On'', however, he was "worshipped" by many in the gay community for writing the book, but also seen as someone who pandered to publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalz, Jeffrey. "At Home With: Randy Shilts; Writing Against Time, Valiantly;" ''New York Times'' April 22, 1993. p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts declared while promoting the book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western world could be eradicated, and by 1994, "AIDS could be as manageable as [[diabetes]]". However, in reference to Africa, Shilts noted, "At this point it's inconceivable that there will be an AIDS-free world in Central Africa, as we're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;"West 'AIDS-free within 30&amp;nbsp;years.'" ''Sunday Mail'' (South Africa), September 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, "the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David. "Gender of Editors Affects Coverage of Stories on Sex Media: Women tend to favor more candor in reports on rape, AIDS and the private lives of politicians. Series: THE PRESS AND SEX: Assessing media's coverage when private matters become public. Second in a two-part series." ''Los Angeles Times'': August 19, 1991. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shilts died from complications of AIDS in 1994, age 42.&lt;ref name="lrb"/&gt; Upon his death he was eulogized by [[Cleve Jones]], who said "Randy's contribution was so crucial. He broke through society's denial and was absolutely critical to communicating the reality of AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Jennifer. "Randy Shilts, Chronicler of AIDS Epidemic, Dies at 42 Journalism: Author of 'And the Band Played On' is credited with awakening nation to the health crisis."'' Los Angeles Times'' February 18, 1994. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Kramer said of him, "He single-handedly probably did more to educate the world about AIDS than any single person."&lt;ref&gt;"Randy Shilts, journalist, 42, of AIDS." ''Telegram &amp; Gazette''. (Worcester, Massachusetts): February 18, 1994. p. B.7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|And the Band Played On (film)}}

''And the Band Played On'' was used as the basis for a 1993 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]-winning [[HBO]] [[television film]] of the same name. It was produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]], and starred [[Matthew Modine]] as epidemiologist [[Don Francis]] and [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow]] at the Centers for Disease Control. [[Alan Alda]] portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for [[Screen Actors Guild|union-scale]] pay. The film was released the same year as ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', and the play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes]]'' premiered, which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it.&lt;ref&gt;Brelsauer, Jan "1993&amp;nbsp;year in Review AIDS The Year the Plague Went Mainstream." Los Angeles Times; December 26, 1993. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, Matt. "'Band': Noble, but slightly out of sync." ''USA TODAY'', September 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''And the Band Played On'', along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.&lt;ref&gt;Natale, Richard. "HBO filmmaker gives TV movies a new image." ''The Washington Times'', May 1, 1994, p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Angel of Grief''''' or the '''''Weeping Angel''''' is an 1894 sculpture by [[William Wetmore Story]] for the grave of his wife Emelyn Story at the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Its full title bestowed by the creator was ''The Angel of Grief Weeping Over the Dismantled Altar of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2015/08/14/vandalism-angel-grief-081415/|title=Stanford police seek information on vandalism of Angel of Grief|date=14 August 2015|work=Stanford News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was Story's last major work prior to his death, a year after his wife. The statue's creation was documented in an 1896 issue of ''Cosmopolitan Magazine'': according to this account, his wife's death so devastated Story that he lost interest in sculpture, but was inspired to create the monument by his children, who recommended it as a means of memorializing the woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan Magazine'', cited in {{cite web|url=http://www.hinghamcemetery.org/pie_3f.html|publisher=Hingham Cemetery|title=Angel of Grief|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the typical angelic grave art, "this dramatic life-size winged figure speaks more of the pain of those left behind" by appearing "collapsed, weeping and draped over the tomb".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The term is now used to describe multiple grave stones throughout the world erected in the style of the Story stone.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book|page=158|isbn=9781603441636|title=Houston's Silent Garden|author=Turner, Suzanne; Wilson, Joanne|publisher=Texas A&amp;M Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the design "one of the most copied images in the world".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/mar/02/the-10-best-famous-graves|newspaper=The Guardian|title=The 10 best... famous graves|author=Stanford, Peter|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Story himself wrote that "It represents the angel of Grief, in utter abandonment, throwing herself with drooping wings and hidden face over a funeral altar. It represents what I feel. It represents Prostration. Yet to do it helps me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FPpqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347|title=William Wetmore Story and His Friends|edition=abridged and annotated|author=James, Henry|publisher=Big Byte Books|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent replicas of the Angel of Grief sculpture include the Henry Lathrop monument, located in the Stanford Arboretum at [[Stanford University]]. Lathrop was the brother of [[Jane Stanford]], the co-founder of the university. The original replica was built in 1901, but was severely damaged in the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]], leading to its replacement in 1908. After years of neglect, the 1908 replacement was fully restored in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Labor of Love Leads to a Happy Ending for "Angel of Grief"| url =http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/mausoleum-418.html| accessdate = 10 May 2010|work=Stanford News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Angel of Grief Restoration| url =http://www.customstonecarving.com/stone%20restoration/Angel%20of%20Grief%20.pdf| accessdate = 10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =A photo of the Memorial after the 1906 quake, showing the fallen canopy.| url =http://quake06.stanford.edu/centennial/gallery/structures/palmdrive/pages/sc206_bx1_fldr9_pg10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the Cassard angel, erected around 1908 in the [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=41|isbn=9781423621027|title=

The image has also been used in popular culture, such as in an album cover for the band [[Nightwish]]'s album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'' (2004) and in the 2012 film ''[[The Woman in Black]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The '''Animals in War Memorial''' (officially '''Animals in War''' and '''Les animaux en temps de guerre''') is a memorial sculpture located at [[Confederation Park]] in [[Ottawa]]. It commemorates animals used by the Canadian military ([[Canadian Army]]) in conflicts since the [[Second Boer War]] (this excludes the use of animals by [[British Army]] and [[French Army]] before [[Canada]] existed as a country).

== Sculptures ==

The memorial consists of three plaques mounted on a stone and sculpture of a dog with foot prints locate next to the [[South African War Memorial, Ottawa]] and near the [[National Aboriginal Veterans Monument]].
The plaques consists of:

* Dedication to animals at war
* Dedication to [[Mule]]s
* Dedication to [[Horse]]s
* Dedication to [[Dog]]s

Inscriptions on the plaques are in English and French.

The plaques and sculpture are created by Ottawa-based artist [[David Clendining]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aiwdedication.ca/aiw-dedication/david-clendining/&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Laureen Harper]] as honorary patron of the project.

== Construction ==

The memorial was inspired by [[Lloyd Swick]], a [[World War II]] and [[Korean War]] veteran, who remembered a painting of a horse at war at his high school in 1939. Swick and supporters presented the idea for a memorial to the National Capital Commission Committee in 2010. The memorial became reality and was unveiled on November 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://aiwdedication.ca/project-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AnthonyRoll-1 Great Harry.jpg|alt=A colorful illustration shows a highly ornamented ship with four masts and bristling with guns sailing over a mild swell towards the right of the picture, towing a small boat|thumb|right|The first illustration of the first roll of the Anthony Roll, depicting the ''[[Henry Grace à Dieu]]'', the largest ship in the English navy during the reign of [[King Henry VIII]].]]
The '''Anthony Roll''' is a record of ships of the English [[Tudor navy]] of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It originally consisted of three rolls of [[vellum]], depicting 58&amp;nbsp;naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to [[Henry VIII of England|King&amp;nbsp;Henry VIII]] in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave two of the rolls to [[Samuel Pepys]], who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which is now in the [[Pepys Library]] at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by [[William IV of England|William IV]] to his daughter, [[Lady Mary Fox|Mary Fox]], who sold it to the [[British Museum]] in 1858; it is now owned by the [[British Library]].

The Anthony Roll is the only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of the English navy in the [[Tudor period]]. As the work of a successful state official in 16th century England, the artistic value of the Anthony Roll has been described as being characterised by "naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern" though its artistic aspects display "a decent amateur grasp of form and colour".&lt;ref name="Ann Payne 2000 p. 20"/&gt; While the inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate, most of the ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula. The level of detail of the ship design, armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate. Nevertheless, through their depiction of the ceremonial ornamentation the illustrations in the Roll have provided relevant secondary information to the study of Tudor period [[heraldry]], [[flag]]s and ship ornamentation.

The only known contemporary depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the ''[[Henry Grace à Dieu]]'' and the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' are contained in the Anthony Roll. As the ''Mary Rose'' sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982, comparison between the information in the Roll and the physical evidence of the ''Mary Rose'' has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period.

==Author and artist==
'''Anthony Anthony'''&lt;!--Please leave the name of the bolded since the author redirects to this section--&gt; has been identified as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with [[holograph]] letters among the State Papers.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Loades "The Manuscript and its Compiler" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a [[Flemish people|Fleming]] from [[Middelburg]] in [[Zeeland]] who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the [[Tower of London]], a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the [[Ordnance Office]], the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, [[Calais]], [[Boulogne]], and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against [[Le Havre]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Loades "The Manuscript and its Compiler" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 Dutch historian Nicholas Beets proposed that the Flemish artist and cartographer [[Cornelis Antoniszoon]] (or Antonisz., c.&amp;nbsp;1507–1553) could have been Anthony Anthony's brother. Although Beets' suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence, it was picked up by [[Geoffrey Callender]] in the ''[[Mariner's Mirror]]'' in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors.&lt;ref&gt;A recent reference can be found in Rodger (1997), p. 548, note 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The will of William Anthony did not mention any other sons and Anthonisz. is believed to have been the son of Antonis Egbertson, the daughter of [[Jacob Corneliszoon van Oostzanen]]. That Cornelis and Anthony were related is, in the words of Ann Payne, "not, presumably, impossible, but there is little evidence that they were connected at all".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the manuscript==
[[File:Basire Embarkation of Henry VIII.jpg|alt=A small fleet of large, highly decorated carracks are riding on a wavy sea. In the foreground are two low, fortified towers bristling with cannon and armed soldiers and retinue walking between them.|thumb|right|''The Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover'', a contemporary painting that, just like the Anthony Roll, was intended to serve as a showpiece of Tudor royal authority and military might.]]
The "ship portrait" had a long history in [[maritime art]], from medieval seals and coins to early [[engraving]]s in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;  The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or "plats", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during King Henry's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting ''Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover'' which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.&lt;ref name="Ann Payne 2000 p. 20"&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of [[Anne of Cleves]] from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' that sank at the [[Battle of the Solent]] 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The [[galleass]]es, the ''[[HMS Antelope (1546)|Antelope]]'', ''Hart'', ''Bull'' and ''Tiger'', all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the ''Hart'' was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the ''Galley Blanchard'', captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pepys portrait by Kneller.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=A copper engraving of a man with a composed expression wearing a large, dark, long-haired wig. |[[Samuel Pepys]] in 1689. Pepys, the owner of two of the rolls, had them cut up and bound in a single volume.]]
After the rolls were presented to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave two of the rolls to [[Samuel Pepys]], a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose the details of how the rolls were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king's account of how he escaped from the [[Battle of Worcester]] (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677–89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]], [[Cambridge]], where it remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Knighton, "The Manuscript and its Compiler" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s, but actually remained in the hands of the royal family. [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] gave it to [[Lady Mary Fox|Mary FitzClarance]], one of his illegitimate children by the courtesan [[Dorothea Jordan]], sometime in the early 19th century. In 1824, FitzClarance married Charles Robert Fox, a major-general and from 1832–35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance, the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him. Fox was a [[bibliophile]], and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll, but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars. In 1857 [[Frederic Madden]], keeper of manuscripts at the [[British Museum]], was shown the second roll and learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it. After negotiations it was sold for £15 to the British Museum and was numbered [[Additional manuscripts|Additional MS]] 22047.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/henryviii/militmap/antroll/ Anthony roll at the British Library]&lt;/ref&gt; It was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in the [[British Library]]'s manuscript collection at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Knighton, "The Manuscript and its Compiler" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthony Roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of the English navy of the 16th century but the full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:AnthonyRoll-second roll sample.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A worn parchment document with several columns of text above a picture of a small sailing vessel.|A view of the second roll of the Anthony Roll, showing the layout used throughout the document. The information for each vessel is displayed in columns directly below its illustration, here with the text for the ''Grand Mistress'' (seen only partially above the text) and a full view of the illustration of the [[galleass]] ''Anne Gallant''.]]
The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate [[vellum]] rolls. It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70&amp;nbsp;cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96&amp;nbsp;cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches).&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as '''Pepys 2991'''. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the ''[[Henry Grace à Dieu]]'', ''[[Mary Rose]]'' and ''[[Peter Pomegranate]]'' were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, '''British Library Additional MS 22047''', is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by [[Mary Fox]] from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Knighton, "The Manuscript and its Compiler" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction. Each ship is presented along with its name, tonnage,&lt;ref&gt;This is a rather rough estimate of burthen, the carrying capacity of a ship, and should not be confused with the much more modern measurement of [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], which would be considerably higher than the figures in the roll. For a detailed discussion of the meaning of tonnage and burthen in early modern naval terminology, see Rodger (1997), pp. xx–xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; crew size and, in Anthony's own words, "the ordenaunce, artillery, munitions and habillimentes for warre".&lt;ref&gt;Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The first roll lists the [[carrack]]s and one pinnace, beginning with the largest ship ''Henry Grace à Dieu''. The second roll lists [[galleass]]es, a hybrid of oar-powered and sailing vessels, and one [[galley]]. Finally, the third roll is reserved for [[full rigged pinnace|pinnaces]] and "rowbarges", both basically smaller versions of galleasses.&lt;ref&gt;See John Bennel, "The Oared Vessels" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 35 for a detailed discussion of the definition of the various oar-powered vessels.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic analysis==
[[File:AnthonyRoll-30 Galley Subtle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colorful image of a one-masted vessel propelled by a large group of rowers. Toward the back of the ship a man is holding a raised baton, urging the rowers on.|The ''Galley Subtle'', a Mediterranean-type [[galley]] which formed the centrepiece of the three combined rolls and the illustration that displays the highest artistic quality.]]
Anthony Anthony was not a trained, professional artist. The illustrations are described as "striking and boldly executed, but [...] have few claims to be fine works of art". The vessels are for the most part painted according to a standard formula, with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions. Anthony's style is signified by a "naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern [...] consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour".&lt;ref name="Ann Payne 2000 p. 20"/&gt;

The rolls were all of roughly the same length, about 5.5&amp;nbsp;m (15&amp;nbsp;ft), and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall. The focal point of the whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the ''Galley Subtle'' is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the [[full rigged pinnace|pinnace]] ''Mary James'' in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed at the beginning of the third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths.&lt;ref name="Ann Payne 2000 p. 20"/&gt; In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;Loades (1992), pp. 91–92; Rodger (1997), pp. 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lettering, framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with the exception of the first three ships of the first roll, which also feature gold. Most of the illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes. Ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in the bow and stern to achieve depth, decorations and anchors are highlighted with red, and green is used for guns. Contours are in black and the sea is in shades varying from "greyish green" to "a richer blue".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AnthonyRoll-27 Salamander.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A small four-masted sailing vessel with a small lizard-like sculpture in its bow.|The [[Salamander of Leith|''Salamander'']], a galleass captured from the Scots and one of only three ships in the Anthony Roll which has an identifiable [[figurehead (object)|figurehead]].]]
The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges (essentially small galleys) were done more hastily. The first two ships of the first roll, the ''Henry Grace à Dieu'' and the ''Mary Rose'', have traces of a grid pattern, indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand. Overall, the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship. The exceptions are [[quarter gallery|stern galleries]] of some of the galleasses and the [[figurehead (object)|figureheads]] of the ''Mary Rose'', ''Salamander'' and the ''Unicorn'', the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Joseph ed., ''The History of Mary Stewart by Claude Nau'', Edinburgh, (1883), 318, 338-9: ''The Late Expedition in Scotland'', London (1544), reprinted in ''Tudor Tracts'', London (1903), 41, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent exception is the ''Galley Subtle'' placed in the middle of the second roll. It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean-type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges, and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only ship where any crew is visible, in this case rowers behind [[pavises|pavisades]] as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing "a [[Tudor bonnet|bonnet]], full skirted armorial [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and baggy breeches" holding a stick or baton, as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers.&lt;ref&gt;John Bennel, "The Oared Vessels" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as an historical source==
As an historical record, the Anthony Roll is in many ways unique. It is the only known fully illustrated list of a Tudor period royal navy,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Payne, "An Artistic Survey" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; though the pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life. For example, the lists of guns of the individual ships, which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official, are only approximately matched to the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Loades, "The Ordnance" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The rigging is only roughly accurate, and has been described by [[Margaret Rule]], archaeological project leader of the ''Mary Rose'' excavations, as "a confusing assemblage of [[shroud (sailing)|shroud]]s, [[ratlines]] and [[Stays (nautical)|stay]]s". Many details are present, but others are missing, such as the chain-wales (the horizontal platforms extending from the sides) to which the shrouds (the parallel ropes that stabilized the masts) were attached to keep them clear of the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Rule (1983), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with the ''Mary Rose''===
[[File:AnthonyRoll-2 Mary Rose.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A sailing vessel similar in size to the ''Henry Grace a Dieu'' already described. On the top of the forecastle in the bow of the ship is a small sculpture of a bright-red flower.|The illustration of the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', which has been compared to the salvaged wreck of the actual ship to determine the historical accuracy of Anthony Anthony's ship portrayals]]
Comparisons with the finds from the salvaged ''[[Mary Rose]]'' itself have provided an opportunity to compare the accuracy of the records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the [[orlop deck]], just about the waterline, would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the ''Mary Rose'' has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the [[forecastle]] has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Vine, "The ship" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation, but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the [[aftcastle]], aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Loades, "The Ordnance" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of ammunition, small firearms, [[longbow]]s, arrows, pikes, and [[Bill (weapon)|bills]] closely matches the archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Alexzandra Hildred, "The Evidence of the ''Mary Rose'' Excavation: The Munitions" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the ''Mary Rose'', it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Gardiner (2005), Marsden (2009) and Stirland (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flags and ornamentation===
[[File:AnthonyRoll-7 Pauncy.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A sailing vessel with square flags along its railing: the designs include horizontal green and white stripes, the cross of Saint George, three fleurs-de-lys on a blue background and the blue, red and gold English royal arms.|The carrack ''Pansy'' with various types of heraldic banners along its railings.]]
The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships. According to the [[vexillology|vexillologist]] Timothy Wilson, the flags depicted flying from the ships are "the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Wilson, "The Flags, Function and heraldry" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a [[St George's Cross|Saint George]] red cross on white ground on the [[Flag terminology|hoist]], nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hayward, "The Flags, Fabric" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the railing of all ships, most prominently on the large carracks and the ''Galley Subtle'', there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs, including the English royal arms, one or three [[fleur-de-lis]] of the French arms, Saint George's crosses and Henry VIII's monogram ("HR") in gold on blue, what appears to be the Tudor rose, and the green and white of the [[House of Tudor]]. The depictions of the flags and banners on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent. A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts, but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically. Some of the heraldic designs have been described as "unlikely" by the 20th century herald [[George Bellew]], but have deemed to at least be "plausible" by Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Wilson, "The Flags, Function and heraldry" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bibliography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βιβλίον ''biblion'', "book" and -γραφία ''-graphia'', "writing"), as a discipline, is traditionally the academic study of [[book]]s as physical,  cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as '''bibliology'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |title=bibliology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''). Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as objects (descriptive bibliography).

== Etymology ==
The word ''bibliographia'' (βιβλιογραφία) was used by Greek writers in the first three centuries AD to mean the copying of books by hand. In the 12th century, the word started being used for "the intellectual activity of composing books". The 17th century then saw the emergence of the modern meaning, that of description of books.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Rudolf. ''Bibliographia, an inquiry into its definition and designations''. Translated by Mathilde V. Rovelstad. Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association; Folkestone, Kent, England: Dawson, 1980. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8389-0146-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the field of bibliography has expanded to include studies that consider the book as a material object.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Bibliography. http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/bsuva/sb/&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliography in its systematic pursuit of understanding the past and the present through written and printed documents describes a way and means of extracting information from this material. Bibliographers are interested in comparing versions of texts to each other rather than in interpreting their meaning or assessing their significance.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Hardy, M. (2017). Bibliographic enterprise and the digital age: Charles Evans and the making of early American literature. ''American Literary History, 29''(2), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of study ==
Bibliography is a specialized aspect of [[library science]] (or [[library and information science]], LIS) and [[documentation science]]. It was established by a [[Belgian]], named [[Paul Otlet]] (1868-1944), who was the founder of the field of documentation, as a branch of the information sciences,  who wrote about "the science of bibliography."&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). ''Les sciences bibliographiques et la documentation''. Bruxelles, Institut international de bibliographie.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otlet, P. (1903). "The science of bibliography and documentation"2. In Rayward, W.B. (trans. and ed.), (1990), ''International organisation and dissemination of knowledge: Selected essays of Paul Otlet''. FID, Amsterdam: Elsevier.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have recently been voices claiming that "the bibliographical paradigm" is obsolete, and it is not today common in LIS. A defense of the bibliographical paradigm was provided by Hjørland (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2007). "Arguments for 'the bibliographical paradigm'. Some thoughts inspired by the new English edition of the UDC", Information Research, 12(4) paper colis06. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis06.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantitative study of bibliographies is known as [[bibliometrics]], which is today an influential subfield in LIS.

== Branches ==
Carter and Barker (2010) describe bibliography as a twofold scholarly discipline—the organized listing of books (enumerative bibliography) and the systematic description of books as physical objects (descriptive bibliography). These two distinct concepts and practices have separate rationales and serve differing purposes. Innovators and originators in the field include [[W. W. Greg]], [[Fredson Bowers]], [[Philip Gaskell]], [[G. Thomas Tanselle]].

Bowers (1949) refers to enumerative bibliography as a procedure that identifies books in “specific collections or libraries,” in a specific discipline, by an author, printer, or period of production (3). He refers to descriptive bibliography as the systematic description of a book as a material or physical artifact. Analytical bibliography, the cornerstone of descriptive bibliography, investigates the printing and all physical features of a book that yield evidence establishing a book's history and transmission (Feather 10). It is the preliminary phase of bibliographic description and  provides the vocabulary, principles and techniques of analysis that descriptive bibliographers apply and on which they base their descriptive practice.

Descriptive bibliographers follow specific conventions and associated classification in their description.  Titles and title pages are transcribed in a quasi-facsimile style and representation. Illustration, typeface, binding, paper, and all physical elements related to identifying a book follow formulaic conventions, as Bowers established in his foundational opus, ''The Principles of Bibliographic Description''. The thought expressed in this book expands substantively on W. W. Greg's groundbreaking theory that argued for the adoption of formal bibliographic principles (Greg 29). Fundamentally, analytical bibliography is concerned with objective, physical analysis and history of a book while descriptive bibliography employs all data that analytical bibliography furnishes and then codifies it with a view to identifying the ideal copy or form of a book that most nearly represents the printer's initial conception and intention in printing.

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers.

D. F. McKenzie extended previous notions of bibliography as set forth by W. W. Greg, Bowers, Gaskell and Tanselle. He describes the nature of bibliography as "the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception" (1999 12). This concept broadens the scope of bibliography to include "non-book texts" and an accounting for their material form and structure, as well as textual variations, technical and production processes that bring sociocultural context and effects into play. McKenzie's perspective contextualizes textual objects or artifacts with sociological and technical factors that have an effect on production, transmission and, ultimately, ideal copy (2002 14). Bibliography, generally, concerns the material conditions of books [as well as other texts] how they are designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted, collected.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gaskell, ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic works differ in the amount of detail depending on the purpose and can generally be divided into two categories: enumerative bibliography (also called compilative, reference or systematic), which results in an overview of [[publication]]s in a particular category and analytical or critical bibliography, which studies the production of books.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, Terry.

Institut d'histoire du livre, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, bibliography mostly focused on books.

=== Enumerative bibliography ===
[[File:Pn-samara-n-a-2000-11.jpg|thumb|Bibliographer workplace in Russia]]
An enumerative bibliography is a systematic list of books and other works such as [[academic journal|journal]] [[article (publishing)|article]]s. Bibliographies range from "works [[citation|cited]]" lists at the end of books and articles, to complete and independent publications. A notable example of a complete, independent publication is Gow's, ''A. E. Housman: A Sketch, Together with a List of His Classical Papers'' (1936). As separate works, they may be in bound volumes such as those shown on the right, or computerized [[bibliographic database]]s. A [[library catalog]], while not referred to as a "bibliography," is bibliographic in nature. Bibliographical works are almost always considered to be [[tertiary source]]s.

Enumerative bibliographies are based on a unifying principle such as creator, subject, date, topic or other characteristic. An entry in an enumerative bibliography provides the core elements of a text resource including a title, the creator(s), publication date and place of publication. Belanger (1977) distinguishes an enumerative bibliography from other bibliographic forms such as descriptive bibliography, analytical bibliography or textual bibliography in that its function is to record and list, rather than describe a source in detail or with any reference to the source's physical nature, materiality or textual transmission. The enumerative list may be comprehensive or selective. One noted example would be Tanselle's bibliography that exhaustively enumerates topics and sources related to all forms of bibliography. A more common and particular instance of an enumerative bibliography relates to specific sources used or considered in preparing a scholarly paper or academic term paper.

Citation styles vary.

An entry for a book in a bibliography usually contains the following elements:
* creator(s)
* title
* place of publication
* publisher or printer
* date of publication

An entry for a journal or periodical article usually contains:
* creator(s)
* article title
* journal title
* volume
* pages
* date of publication

A bibliography may be arranged by author, topic, or some other scheme. [[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] give descriptions about how each source is useful to an author in constructing a paper or argument. These descriptions, usually a few sentences long, provide a summary of the source and describe its relevance. [[Reference management software]] may be used to keep track of references and generate bibliographies as required.

Bibliographies differ from [[library catalog]]s by including only relevant items rather than all items present in a particular library. However, the catalogs of some [[national library|national libraries]] effectively serve as {{illm|National bibliography|de|Nationalbibliografie|lt=national bibliographies}}, as the national libraries own almost all their countries' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifla.org/node/2216 |work= Ifla.org |title= National Bibliographic Register |accessdate= 1 December 2017 |publisher=[[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] |location=The Hague }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/natbib/bibprint.html |work= Help for researchers |title=National bibliographies and books in print |publisher=British Library |accessdate= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive bibliography ===
Fredson Bowers described and formulated a standardized practice of descriptive bibliography in his ''Principles of Bibliographical Description''
(1949). Scholars to this day treat Bowers' scholarly guide as authoritative. In this classic text, Bowers describes the basic function of bibliography as, "[providing] sufficient data so that a reader may identify the book described, understand the printing, and recognize the precise contents" (124).

==== Descriptive bibliographies as scholarly product ====
Descriptive bibliographies as a scholarly product usually include information on the following aspect of a given book as a material object:
*Format and Collation/Pagination Statement&amp;nbsp;– a conventional, symbolic formula that describes the book block in terms of sheets, folds, quires, signatures, and pages
:::According to Bowers (193), the format of a book is usually abbreviated in the collation formula:
::::Broadsheet: I° or b.s. or bs.
::::Folio: 2° or fol.
::::Quarto: 4° or 4to or Q° or Q
::::Octavo: 8° or 8vo
::::Duodecimo: 12° or 12mo
::::Sexto-decimo: 16° or 16mo
::::Tricesimo-secundo: 32° or 32mo
::::Sexagesimo-quarto: 64° or 64mo
:::The collation, which follows the format, is the statement of the order and size of the gatherings.
::::For example, a quarto that consists of the signed gatherings:
:::::2 leaves signed A, 4 leaves signed B, 4 leaves signed C, and 2 leaves signed D
::::would be represented in the collation formula:
:::::4°: A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B-C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*Binding&amp;nbsp;– a description of the binding techniques (generally for books printed after 1800)
*Title Page Transcription&amp;nbsp;– a transcription of the title page, including rule lines and ornaments
*Contents&amp;nbsp;– a listing of the contents (by section) in the book
*Paper&amp;nbsp;– a description of the physical properties of the paper, including production process, an account of chain-line measurements, and a description of watermarks (if present)
*Illustrations&amp;nbsp;– a description of the illustrations found in the book, including printing process (e.g. woodblock, intaglio, etc.), measurements, and locations in the text
*Presswork&amp;nbsp;– miscellaneous details gleaned from the text about its production
*Copies Examined&amp;nbsp;– an enumeration of the copies examined, including those copies' location (i.e. belonging to which library or collector)

=== Analytical bibliography ===
This branch of the bibliographic discipline examines the material features of a textual artifact&amp;nbsp;– such as type, ink, paper, imposition, format, impressions and states of a book&amp;nbsp;– to essentially recreate the conditions of its production. Analytical bibliography often uses collateral evidence&amp;nbsp;– such as general printing practices, trends in format, responses and non-responses to design, etc.&amp;nbsp;– to scrutinize the historical conventions and influences underlying the physical appearance of a text. The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.&lt;ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations&amp;nbsp;– and the aetiology of variations&amp;nbsp;– in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text (Bowers 498[1]).

== Bibliographers ==
[[File:Paul Otlet à son bureau.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Otlet]], to work in an office built at his home following the closure of the [[Mundaneum|Palais Mondial]] in June 1937]]
A ''bibliographer'' is a person who describes and lists books and other publications, with particular attention to such characteristics as authorship, publication date, edition, typography, etc. A person who limits such efforts to a specific field or discipline is a subject bibliographer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitz|first= Joan M. |year=2010|url= http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_b.aspx |title=Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science|publisher=abc-clio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographer, in the technical meaning of the word, is anyone who writes about books. But the accepted meaning since at least the 18th century is a person who attempts a comprehensive account—sometimes just a list, sometimes a fuller reckoning—of the books written on a particular subject. In the present, bibliography is no longer a career, generally speaking; bibliographies tend to be written on highly specific subjects and by specialists in the field.

The term ''bibliographer'' is sometimes—in particular subject bibliographer—today used about certain roles performed in libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/bib_bibliographers |title=MLA Field Bibliographers |publisher=mla.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bibliographic database]]s.

== Non-book material ==
Systematic lists of media other than books can be referred to with terms formed analogously to ''bibliography'':
* [[Discography]]&amp;nbsp;– recorded music
* [[Filmography]]&amp;nbsp;–  films
* [[Webography]] (or webliography)&amp;nbsp;– websites (the first use of the word "webliography" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from June 1995)

Arachniography is a term coined by [[NASA]] research historian Andrew J. Butrica, which means a reference list of [[URL]]s about a particular subject. It is equivalent to a bibliography in a book. The name derives from ''[[arachne]]'' in reference to a spider and its web.&lt;ref name=atlantic2007&gt;{{cite book | author=Staff | page=28 | title=Encyclopedia Of Information Technology | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors | year=2007 | isbn=81-269-0752-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenzie|first=D.

Before [[Charles Darwin]] and his groundbreaking [[theory of evolution]], primates were mainly used as caricatures of human nature. Although comparisons between man and animal are rather old, it was not until the findings of science that mankind recognised itself as a part of the animal kingdom. (However, in some religious beliefs, mankind still plays a unique role above animals and is not considered part of the animal kingdom)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andreas Blühm and Louise Lippincott, ''Tierschau. Wie unser Bild vom Tier entstand'' (Köln: Wallraf-Richartz-Museum &amp; Fondation Corboud, 2007), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caricatures]] of Darwin and his evolutionary theory reveal how closely science was intertwined with both the arts and the public during the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Donald, introduction to ''Endless Forms. Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts'', ed. Diana Donald and Jane Munro (Cambridge: Fitzwilliam Museum, 2009), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They display the general perception of Darwin, his "monkey theory"&lt;ref&gt;Julia Voss, "Monkeys, Apes and Evolutionary Theory: from Human Descent to King Kong," ''Endless Forms. Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts'', ed. Diana Donald and Jane Munro (Cambridge: Fitzwilliam Museum, 2009), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and apes in 19th-century England.

It depicts the evolution of the worm into the human – in this case, the English gentleman – as a means of ridiculing Darwin's theory.]]

=== ''Professor Darwin'' ===
We see Darwin portrayed as a monkey with his own human head. He holds a mirror up to another monkey which is sitting next to him. It seems as if he would invite the monkey to ponder over himself and his existence. This is underlined by the two accompanying quotations of [[Shakespeare]]: "This is the ape of form" (from: [[Love's Labour's Lost]], act 5, scene 2) and "Some four or five descents since" ([[All's Well that Ends Well]], act 3, scene 7). Darwin's facial expression seems to encourage the monkey to recognise their common ancestry. The ape, in turn, looks into the mirror and tries to touch the reflection to literally grasp Darwin's suggestion and to assure himself of the authenticity of their kinship.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== ''Man Is But a Worm'' ===
[[Linley Sambourne]] drew a "wild evolutionary polonaise"&lt;ref&gt;Julia Voss, "Variieren und Selektieren: Die Evolutionstheorie in der englischen und deutschen illustrierten Presse im 19. Jahrhundert," ''Darwin. Kunst und die Suche nach den Ursprüngen'', ed. Pamela Kort and Max Hollein (Köln: Wienand, 2009), 250.&lt;/ref&gt;  which spirals up from C H A O S and ends in the English gentleman holding a cylinder. Among the stages in the process are the earthworm, the monkey and the cave man. Clocks are displayed in the background; the path on which the evolution proceeds is labelled as "times meter" both indicating that the evolution is depicted in time lapse. Darwin is enthroned next to the gentleman and seems to watch the whole development. Thereby he resembles one of the figures of [[Michelangelo]]'s ceiling fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name="CfVoss"&gt;Cf. Voss, "Variieren und Selektieren," 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==

=== ''Professor Darwin'' ===
This caricature offers various starting points for an art-historical analysis. It was published three years after Darwin's work ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871). Here, Darwin finally takes a stand and argues that humans and monkeys share a common ancestor. In the caricature, however, this view is put into question. Moreover, it goes back on the widespread assumption that humans exhibit certain animal features – the ape as a mirror for humankind so to speak. In this respect the caricature stands also in the tradition of [[vanitas]] which is symbolised by the hand mirror reflecting human vanity. The fact that the ape-like Darwin is holding the mirror and not the real ape shows that Darwin and his theory should be ridiculed. Darwin himself has acknowledged that "[he] has given man a pedigree of prodigious length, but not, it may be said, of noble quality."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'' (New York: D. Appleton, ²1874), 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ape is not enhanced in status through his kinship with man.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
After the publication of ''The Descent of Man'' Darwin was increasingly identified with the theory of evolution although his friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was the first to put it forward. As a result, Darwin himself was considered more and more as a suitable object to caricature. The cover of the French satirical magazine ''La Petite Lune'' is a telling example of the paradigmatic representation of Darwin in contemporary cartoons and caricatures.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Janet Browne, "Darwin in Caricature: A Study in the Popularization and Dissemination of Evolution," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 145 (2001): 506.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Darwin as monkey on La Petite Lune.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front page of the French satirical magazine ''La Petite Lune'' by André Gill (1871?).]]

=== ''Man Is But a Worm'' ===
Sambourne's caricature deals in a playful manner with the topics "evolution" and "descent of man." The title alludes to a publication of Darwin entitled ''The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations of their Habits'' which was issued in October 1881.&lt;ref name="CfVoss" /&gt; In the caricature, evolution is associated with metamorphosis and portrayed as a gradual process which inevitably leads to advancement. This, however, conveys a reduced if not false picture of Darwin's theory in which competition, hereditary transmission, coincidence and selection play a major role.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bernd Herkner, "Die Welt des Charles Darwin," ''Darwin. Kunst und die Suche nach den Ursprüngen'', ed. Pamela Kort and Max Hollein (Köln: Wienand, 2009), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, these circular images of evolutionary progression form a striking contrast to Darwin’s own linear and branching evolutionary trees. In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' Darwin "took pains to emphasize that evolution was neither progressive nor circular."&lt;ref&gt;Browne, "Darwin in Caricature," 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

That the earthworm is transformed into a monkey and not into another animal might indicate that the thesis of a kinship between ape and human received a wider acceptance among the British public (''The Descent of Man'' had been published 10 years earlier). Still, the monkey is depicted as the underdeveloped version of a human. At the same time, however, the "superior" human being or rather the English gentleman is ridiculed: he too is descended from an earthworm.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Precursors and reception ==
Precursors for the depiction of anthropomorphic animals were the works of [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]] who portrayed individuals for example in ''Les Métamorphoses du jour'' (1828–29) with the bodies of men and faces of animals. The caricatures of [[Charles Philipon]] can also be considered as a role model for the illustrators of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and other English satirical magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Voss, "Variieren und Selektieren," 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical depiction of Darwin's evolutionary theory might have been modelled on the wood engravings of the illustrator [[Charles H. Bennett (illustrator)|Charles H. Bennett]] which show transformations of humans into immobile objects and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The caricatures provide not only insights into the public perception of Darwin's evolutionary theory but also played an essential part in its dissemination and popularisation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Browne, "Darwin in Caricature," 508-09.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s and 1870s the kinship between ape and man was doubted more frequently than in later decades where this idea received a wider acceptance. Today we meet the evolutionary theory on T-shirts in the form of [[graphic arts]]. Quite often, it is the lifestyle of modern man that is ridiculed. The monkey is now only depicted as the underdeveloped stage of the human and does not function as the caricature of human behaviour any more. Likewise, Darwin has lost his prominent position as a motif for caricatures.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Origin ==
* The caricature ''Prof. Darwin'' was published on 18 February 1874 three years after the publication of Darwin's seminal work ''The Descent of Man'' in ''Figaro'''s London Sketch Book of Celebrities. The artist is unknown.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* ''Man Is But a Worm'', a caricature by Edward Linley Sambourne, was printed in ''Punch'''s Almanack for 1882 on 6 December 1881.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* A drawing done by Edward Linley Sambourne references Darwin. This drawing was titled, "Man is But a Worm." On 6 December 1881, this drawing was put into Punch's Almanac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong – The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|website=BostonGlobe.com|publisher=© 2016 BOSTON GLOBE MEDIA PARTNERS, LLC|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daprato Rigali Studios''' (formerly '''Daprato Statuary Company''') is an [[renovation|interior restoration and renovation]] company in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dmoz.org/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Historic_Preservation/Materials_and_Supplies/&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1860&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OY_o8YXKg8QC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;lpg=PA627&amp;dq=%22john+e.+rigali%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpYZ6OTyiD&amp;sig=3OgDB0qe-R9KkQ_MiL4kqfZN1PQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG04763KHPAhVFPz4KHeV9Dg4Q6AEIQzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20e.%20rigali%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; by the Daprato brothers, Italian immigrants from the town of [[Barga]]. The company specializes in decorative [[painting]], [[stained glass]] and [[marble]] fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-08-14/news/0308140128_1_papal-altar-furnishings&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1881, [[John E. Rigali]], the great-grandfather of the firm’s current family members, completed his training in [[Florence]] and immigrated to Chicago to work with the Daprato brothers. Rigali became a partner in 1884 and, in 1890, president of Daprato Statuary Company.&lt;ref name=ndm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butterman|first1=Eric|title=Church restoration a family reunion|url=http://magazine.nd.edu/news/65256-church-restoration-a-family-reunion/|website=Notre Dame magazine|accessdate=29 August 2016|date=Spring 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] bestowed on Daprato Studios the title of "Pontifical Institute of Christian Art."&lt;ref name="ol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daprato Rigali Studios - Our Legacy|url=http://dapratorigali.com/our-legacy/|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s they operated locations in Chicago, [[Montreal]], [[New York City]] and [[Pietrasanta]].  
 
In 1960, under the guidance of Robert Rigali, the organization took on the name, Daprato Rigali Studios.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brachear|first1=Manya A.|title=Renovated Holy Name shines in debut mass|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-holyname-080209-story.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|publisher=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is currently managed by 4th generation Rigali family members Bob, John, Mike and Elizabeth.

'''David Morrell''' (born April 24, 1943) is a Canadian-American [[novelist]], best known for his debut 1972 [[novel]] ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'', which would later become [[Rambo (film series)|the successful Rambo film franchise]] starring [[Sylvester Stallone]]. He has written 28 novels, and his work has been translated into 26 languages.&lt;ref name=BioPage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmorrell.net/about.cfm |title=Biography |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He  also wrote the 2007–2008 [[Captain America]] [[comic book]] [[miniseries]] ''The Chosen''.

==Early life==
Morrell was born on the 24 April 1943 in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada. He decided to become a writer at the age of 17, after being inspired by the writing in the classic television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''. In 1966, Morrell received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English from [[St. Jerome's University]] and moved to the United States to study with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] scholar Philip Young at [[Pennsylvania State University]], where he would eventually receive his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in [[American literature]].

==Career==
During his time at Penn State he met [[science fiction]] writer Philip Klass, better known by the pseudonym [[William Tenn]], who taught the basics of writing fiction.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt; Morrell began work as an English professor at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1970. In 1972, his novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' was published; it would eventually be made into the [[First Blood|1982 film of the same name]] starring [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Vietnam veteran John Rambo. Morrell continued to write many other novels, including ''[[The Brotherhood of the Rose]]'', the first in a trilogy of novels, which was adapted into a 1989 [[NBC]] [[miniseries]] starring [[Robert Mitchum]]. He gave up his tenure at the university in 1986 in order to write full-time.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

Morrell is the co-president of the [[International Thriller Writers]] organization.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

==Personal life==
Morrell's teenaged son Matthew died of [[Ewing's sarcoma]], a rare form of [[bone cancer]], in 1987. The trauma of his loss influenced Morrell's work, in particular in his creative fiction memoir about Matthew, ''Fireflies''. The protagonist of Morrell's novel ''Desperate Measures'' also experiences the loss of a son.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

Morrell is a graduate of the [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] for wilderness survival as well as the [[G. Gordon Liddy]] Academy of Corporate Security. He is also an honorary lifetime member of the Special Operations Association and the Association of Former Intelligence Officers.&lt;ref name=BioPage/&gt;

'''''Decemviri Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala dei Decemviri'') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1495-1496, and housed in the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] in [[Vatican City]].

The work was commissioned by the Decemviri ("Ten Men") of [[Perugia]] for the chapel in the [[Palazzo dei Priori]], and was executed 1495 to 1496. It was originally surmounted by a ''Pietà'' (87 x 90&amp;nbsp;cm), now at the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].

==Description==
The work portrays the Virgin on a high throne, with decorations and reliefs. Behind her is a bright landscape with hills. She holds the child in a position identical to that in the ''[[Fano Altarpiece]]''. At her sides are Saint Lawrence, Louis of Toulouse, [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]] and [[Constantius of Perugia]].

The portico theme was typical of Perugino's late 15th century works, such as the ''[[Albani Torlonia Polyptych]]'' and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''.

Retrieved April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mirage Enterprises. She lives in [[Los Angeles]] and is best known for the films ''[[Only You (1994 film)|Only You]]'' and ''[[What Women Want]]''.

==Early life==
Drake was born and grew up in the [[San Fernando Valley]] of [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="Bluecat"&gt;[http://www.bluecatscreenplay.com/blog/exclusive-interview-with-diane-drake-screenwriter-of-only-you-and-what-women-want/ Bluecat Screenwriting Competition], Interview with Diane Drake. Retrieved January 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied Communications/Visual Arts at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="Bluecat" /&gt;

==Career==
Diane Drake worked for [[Sydney Pollack]]'s production company, Mirage Enterprises, from 1988-1992, rising to the position of Vice President of Creative Affairs.&lt;ref name="Bluecat" /&gt;

===Writing===
Drake began writing screenplays in 1991. Her first screenplay, ''Dog Meets Cat'', though never more than optioned material,&lt;ref name="V1"&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR102541 TriStar ponies up $ 1 mil for 'Him'], ''Variety Magazine''. Retrieved April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; earned her a writing assignment with [[Hanna-Barbera]]. She worked on rewriting ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', with dogs, in a project that was never produced.&lt;ref name="AS1" /&gt;

In 1992 she wrote a [[spec script]] called ''Him'', which sold to [[TriStar Pictures]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name="V1" /&gt; It was produced in 1994 as ''[[Only You (1994 film)|Only You]]'', starring [[Marisa Tomei]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117909066/ 'Only You'], ''Variety Magazine''. Retrieved April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie was remade in China by the Huayi Brothers in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Hollywood Reporter October 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Drake wrote a spec script called ''Ladies Man'', in which a male protagonist who works in advertising is able to read women's thoughts. In November 1995, [[Caravan Pictures]] optioned the script for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-11-17-1995-6 ''Spec sold on way to E.R.''], Daily Variety. Retrieved April 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York Post]], Drake's agent sent ''Ladies Man'' to [[Nancy Meyers]] in 1996 as a writing sample.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news | author = Paula Froelich | author2 = Chris Wilson | last-author-amp = yes | title = SCRIPT-LIFTING CHARGED IN SUIT | date = December 15, 2003 | work = New York Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Nancy Meyers rewrote a script by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, called ''Head Games'', based on a pitch they sold to Touchstone—another division of the same studio that had bought Drake's script—in June, 1997, (nineteen months after Drake's original script had been optioned by the studio and one month after the studio's option on Drake's work had expired.) &lt;ref&gt;Hollywood Reporter Archives June 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; ''Head Games'' was developed with Todd Garner, who served as an executive under Joe Roth, co-owner of [[Caravan Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0307776/bio&lt;/ref&gt; Their work also had a male protagonist able to read women's thoughts. Meyers changed the title of ''Head Games'' to ''What Women Want,'' a line of dialogue taken from Drake's script. The New York Post said:
{{cquote|"Nancy later told Paramount she had never read Diane's screenplay, but the record showed she had taken a meeting with Drake based upon the script's submission as a writing sample," the Paramount source added. Drake had her attorneys contact Paramount, and around Dec. 1, 1999, Paramount paid Drake $700,000 - officially saying it was buying ''Ladies Man''.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;}}
Diane Drake has refused to comment on this publicly, but [[Paramount Studios]] granted her a story credit on the 2000 movie. Following arbitration by the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]], Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa received both screenplay and story credits.
''[[What Women Want]]'' went on to become the second largest grossing romantic comedy of all time in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=romanticcomedy.htm Box Office Mojo].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32682">The official history of motion picture production in the State of [[Michigan]] dates back to the beginning of the [[Post–World War II baby boom]]. As of March 14, 2013, the Michigan Film Office website contains a list of 319, filmed in Michigan titles, beginning with ''[[This Time for Keeps]]'', starring [[Esther Williams]] and ([[Jimmy Durante]]) in 1946, followed by ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'', starring [[Jimmy Stewart]] and [[Lee Remick]] in 1959.&lt;ref name = "Filmed in Michigan"/&gt;  Contemporary nationally known works filmed in the state include the drama [[Conviction (2010 film)|''Conviction'']] (2010), starring [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Sam Rockwell]],&lt;ref name="TimeMag"/&gt; ''[[Kill the Irishman]]'' (2011), starring [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Christopher Walken]],&lt;ref name="irish"/&gt; HBO's series [[Hung (TV series)|''Hung'']] was filmed, and is set in, Detroit,&lt;ref name="hung"/&gt; and the Discovery Channel's ''[[Motor City Motors]]'' (2009), formerly ''[[Monster Garage]]'' (2002-2006).&lt;ref name="Motor Garage"/&gt; Originally slated for [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[Clint Eastwood]]'s film [[Gran Torino (film)|''Gran Torino'']] (2008) was filmed in the Detroit area.&lt;ref name = "TimeMag"/&gt;

Changes to the [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|dynamics of the automotive industry]] left the State of Michigan with vacant factories and commercial buildings, these buildings were well suited to be repurposed as [[sound stage]]s and [[Filmmaking|film production]] facilities.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; In 2008, Michigan offered nationally competitive [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film incentives]] that coincided with the [[Effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|automotive industry crisis]].&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; The Michigan Film Incentive effort was successful in creating a film production infrastructure and workforce, however the film incentive was scaled back and capped at $25 million per year by incoming [[Rick Snyder|Governor, Rick Snyder]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;  Negotiations between industry and the legislature resulted in a $50 million budget for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14, caps the film incentive budget at $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

Studio benefactors of the Michigan Film Incentive included: Raleigh Michigan Studios (Now known as [[Michigan Motion Picture Studios]] in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]),&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="motown"/&gt; Detroit Center Studios/Wonderstruck (in [[Detroit]]),&lt;ref name="mgm"/&gt; [[10 West Studios]] (in [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]]) and now defunct Unity Studios ([[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]]).&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReelChicago/&gt;

== The Michigan Film Office ==
The Michigan Film Office is overseen by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and is a benefactor of the Michigan Strategic Fund.&lt;ref name="Strategic fund"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strategic Fund Audit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFODuties/&gt; Formerly, an office consisting of one employee, under the umbrella of the History, Arts, and Libraries, staffing levels grew to six employees after film incentives were introduced in 2008.&lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt; Michelle Begnoche, Public Relations Manager of the Michigan Film Office explains the goal of the film incentive:  "The goal of the incentive is not to incentivize the movies that will make the most money; the goal of the film incentive is to incent those movies who will spend the most money in Michigan. So we are not looking at whether or not they get their money back. We are looking at how much are they going to spend on Michigan workers making that movie and how much are they going to spend in Michigan hotels and in the local areas while making that movie." &lt;ref name="MFO Interview"/&gt;

:"The Michigan Film Office was created in 1979 to assist and attract incoming production companies and to promote the growth of our indigenous industry. It provides several services, such as location photographs; help with location procurement and clearance; liaison with local/county/state government; contacts with business, institutions, neighborhoods, and other groups; production information, and location assistance."
:: '''— Michigan Economic Development Corporation''' &lt;ref name="MFO defined"/&gt;

An organization known as the Michigan Production Alliance was formed as a 501c6 trade group in order to assist film community members with information, education and legislation with regard to the production industry in Michigan. The organization sent representatives to each legislative and non political meeting as the initial film incentives were being developed and assisted in helping both legislators and the general population understand why incentives are like economic development driving diversification for the state's economy.

=== The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive ===

The Michigan Film and Digital Media Incentive was signed into law on April 7, 2008, by Governor [[Jennifer M. Granholm]]([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]). The legislation included Public Acts 74 through 87 of 2008.&lt;ref name=MichiganLeg/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;  Introduced for the purpose of [[Workforce development|workforce]] and [[Infrastructure#Impact on economic development|infrastructure development]], a refundable or transferable tax incentive focuses on film, television and digital media production in the state of Michigan.  The pre-2012 enactment of the film incentive, included a 40-percent subsidy for covered personnel expenditures, with an additional two-percent available for projects produced in Michigan's 103 core communities. Above the line personnel, directors, writers, producers etc., were eligible for a 40% credit on salaries regardless of Michigan residency.  Below the line personnel, film industry craftsmen, technicians and engineers received a 40% credit if they were Michigan residents, or 30% for nonresidents.&lt;ref name="Above the line"/&gt;  Capped at $20 million annually,&lt;ref name=LegAnal/&gt;{{rp|5}} the construction industry also benefited with a 25-percent subsidy for capital improvements, on the creation of new film-industry related facilities. The workforce development incentive also provided a Film and Digital Media Job Training Tax Credit, of 50-percent, for on the job training expenses of Michigan residents.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

Of the 35 states that provide film industry incentives, 13 were considered competitive in 2008, Michigan became one of the top 3 competitors with [[New Mexico]] and [[Louisiana]] in this group. In 2008, Michigan film industry expenditures grossed $125 million, up from $2 million in 2007, creating an estimated 2800 jobs with incentive outlays of $47,992,000.00.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2008"/&gt;

==== Film industry statistics ====
The 2007 Census reports that Michigan's participation in the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]] group, 512110 Motion picture and video production, had 923 employees participating in total salaries of $38.5 million annually ($41,767.00 average); the national employment pool, consisted of 142,620 employees, and generated salaries of $11.9 billion ($83,438.50 average) in the same year. Total industry revenues for, NAICS 512110 Motion picture and video production, was valued at $59.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name=Census/&gt;  It must be kept in mind however that freelance or Seasonal employees who make up the film industry workforce are NOT counted in the NAICS audits because they do not work for a specific company and often work for several during a given year. This makes it hard to quantify the film industry labor force.

==== Four-year Overview ====

:Since the incentives took effect in 2008, the Film Office and the Department of Treasury have approved a total of $392,384,844 in film incentives on $1,003,835,842 in total qualified expenditures by productions in Michigan. This represents 229 projects that have been approved to date, including 164 projects that have actually wrapped the state.
::'''—Michigan Film Office 2011 Annual Report -- March 1, 2012'''&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

==== Public Act 291 of 2011 ====

In March 2011, [[Rick Snyder#Governor of Michigan|Governor Rick Snyder]]([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) announced plans to put a $25 million cap on the [[Michigan Film Incentive]], which at 42%, was one of the most aggressive film incentives in the United States. [[CNN]] reported that agreements signed prior to the cap proposal would be honored and that there were 43 pending applications on file at the [[Michigan Film Office]]. [[John E. Nixon]], [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] and [[Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget]] claimed that the Governor was not opposed to efforts to attract the film industry, but was concerned about uncapped and unfunded expenditures. "Nixon says that every dollar spent brings in only 28 cents, not enough to justify such a high tax incentive."&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Public Act 291 of 2011 (Section 125.2029h), was signed into Michigan law, effective immediately, on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=IncentiveReduced/&gt;  The new law honored existing production approvals with the following conditions stated in the Michigan Film Office 2011 Annual Report. Pre-production must begin within 90 days of approval, projects must have a signed agreement to participate and funds spent prior to obtaining a signed agreement do not qualify; additionally, budget increases must be approved by the Film Office and the Treasury to qualify for the incentive.  An audit with an independent Michigan CPA is required to obtain a post-production certificate, which is then submitted with the production's Michigan Business Tax return.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; Eligible projects are motion pictures, documentaries, television series, miniseries, interactive television, music videos, interactive games, video games, Internet programming, sound recording, ditital animation and interactive websites. Criteria for incentive approval are listed as follows:&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

# The production is financially viable.
# Utilization of existing infrastructure (studios, post-production facilities, equipment rental, etc.).
# The number and wage levels of direct jobs for Michigan residents created by a production.
# Ability to show Michigan in a positive light and promote the state as a tourist destination.
# Magnitude of estimated expenditures in Michigan.

Act 291 did not provide separate funding for infrastructure and workforce development for 2012 and no business tax credits were claimed in these categories for 2011; in the Michigan Film Office 2011 report, the Office was unclear on any discretion regarding funding infrastructure and workforce development expenditures within the $25 million annual cap.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt; paragraph 3, of Section 125.2029h, does not mention infrastructure and workforce development.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Section 125.2029h (13) The film and digital media production assistance program shall provide for all of the following:
::(a) Funding shall be provided only to reimburse direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, crew personnel expenditures, or qualified personnel expenditures.

::(b) To be eligible to apply for funding, the eligible production company shall have direct production expenditures, Michigan personnel expenditures, or a combination of direct production expenditures and Michigan personnel expenditures, of $100,000.00 or more.

Act 291 also specifically disqualifies commercials, televised news, weather reports, financial reports, political and fund-raising events, employee training and productions containing obscene matter from the incentive.&lt;ref name="MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND ACT"/&gt;

Negotiations with the legislature provided $50 million for the film incentive in 2012.&lt;ref name=50million/&gt; The Governor's Recommendation for FY 2013-14 (S.B. 194), reduces the film incentive from $50 million to $25 million.&lt;ref name="FY 2013-14"/&gt;

===== Results of reduction in funding =====

In March 2011, the Michigan Film Office reported to [[CNNMoney.com]] that 43 pending applications could not be addressed until the legislature reached a final decision. Michigan Movie Magazine's, Chris Aliapoulios said, "As these applications sit in limbo, the projects involved are seeking out new locations..." &lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

In its 2011 publication, the Michigan Film Office reported that 24 of 85 project applications were approved, 15 of those projects wrapped in 2011, 2 remained in production and 7 were in pre-production and scheduled to shoot in 2012. Eight additional projects that began in 2010, 2011 expenditures for these projects are included in the 2011 report.  Twenty-five projects spent an estimated $201,968,238 in Michigan and were awarded $75,650,154.  These productions created 3350 jobs, or an equivalent of 766 full-time employment.&lt;ref name="Film Office 2011"/&gt;

==== Film incentive controversy ====

Opposed to the Michigan Film Incentive was the Center for Public Policy, which claimed that employment growth was too modest for the amount of money the state was spending.&lt;ref name=Huffpo/&gt; Governor Snyder has stated, "One of the problems with the tax credit world is that you're picking winners and losers, and government is not really competent to do that." &lt;ref name="Winners and Losers"/&gt;

Proponents of the film incentive, cited a multiplier effect,&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; whereby the simple act of money changing hands creates excise tax income, investment and consumer optimism.  A commissioned report, authored by [[Ernst &amp; Young]], found that 2,631 film industry jobs had been created in 2009 and 3,860 jobs in 2010. Ernst &amp; Young also found that economic activity was increased 6 to 1 for every incentive dollar spent.&lt;ref name=CNNincentive/&gt;

Economist David Zin, states that the film incentives have had a positive impact on the private sector, but also interjects that five years of employment growth, projected by [[Michigan State University]], would only replace 8.1% of the jobs lost in Michigan between May and June 2008.&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; David Zin, closes his 34-page issue paper on film incentives with, "As with other types of incentives and credits, whether the relationship of costs to benefits is acceptable is a decision for individual policy-makers." &lt;ref name=Zin/&gt;

Alexander Martin, an economist, writes to the State of Michigan House Tax Policy Committee Chair, Judson S. Gilbert II, warning the committee of a "[[race to the bottom]]" economic condition, concerning subsidies that are geared toward increasing market share. Martin describes a scenario where the film industry may induce states with film incentives to bid against each other for film production business. Additionally, individuals, corporations and municipalities may make investments in an industry that can disappear when another State raises their film incentive. As proof, he offer the situation where [[Allen Park, Michigan|Allen Park]] was contemplating laying off its fire department largely because Unity Studios relocated to Detroit.&lt;ref name="Martin Testimony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Layoffs"/&gt;

'''''Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies''''' is the 1623 published collection of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. Modern scholars commonly refer to it as the '''First Folio'''.{{efn|More generally, the term ''first folio'' is employed in other appropriate contexts, as in connection with the [[Ben Jonson folios|first folio collection of Ben Jonson's works]] (1616), or the first folio collection of the plays in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|Beaumont and Fletcher canon]] (1647).}} The First Folio is considered one of the most influential books ever published in the English language.{{sfn|The Guardian|2015}}

Printed in [[Folio (printing)|folio]] format and containing 36 plays (see [[Shakespeare's plays#Canonical plays|list of Shakespeare's plays]]), it was prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]]. It was dedicated to the "incomparable pair of brethren" [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]] and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke).

Although 18 of Shakespeare's plays had been published in [[quarto]] before 1623, the First Folio is arguably the only reliable text for about 20 of the plays, and a valuable source text for many of those previously published. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare's, with the exception of ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''; ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]''; and the two [[lost work|lost plays]], ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]''.

On 23 April 1616,{{efn|Dates follow the [[Julian calendar]], used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]]). Under the [[Gregorian calendar]], adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=xv}}}} [[William Shakespeare]] died in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], and was buried in the [[chancel]] of the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon|Church of the Holy Trinity]] two days later. After a long career as an actor, dramatist, and [[shareholder|sharer]] in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]) from {{circa|1585–90}}{{efn|The exact years of his London career are unknown, but biographers suggest that it may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] mentions Shakespeare in his ''[[Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit|Groats-Worth of Wit]]''.{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=144–146}}{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=59}}}} until {{circa|1610–13}},{{efn|There is a tradition, first recorded by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and repeated by [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], that Shakespeare retired to Stratford "some years before his death".{{sfn|Ackroyd|2006|p=476}} Retirement from all work was uncommon,  however, and modern biographers generally do not accord this tradition a lot of weight.{{sfn|Honan|1998|pp=382–383}} But after 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=279}} His last three plays were collaborations, probably with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]],{{sfn|Honan|1998|pp=375–378}} who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=276}}}} he was financially well off and among England's most popular dramatists, both on the stage and in print.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=23}}{{efn|By 1623, Shakespeare’s works had been printed in 95 editions. The closest competitors were [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] (56), [[Thomas Middleton]] (43), and [[Ben Jonson]] (24).{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=23}}}} But his reputation had not yet risen to the greatest writer in the [[English language]] and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2005|p=11}}{{sfn|Bevington|2002|pp=1–3}}{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=399}} [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|A funerary monument]] in Holy Trinity was commissioned, probably by [[Susanna Hall|his oldest daughter]], and installed, most likely sometime before 1617–18, but a monument in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]{{efn|Where [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] were buried, and where Shakespeare's contemporaries like [[Ben Jonson]] would later be either buried or memorialised.}} was not realised until 1740. [[William Basse]] wrote an elegiac poem on him {{circa|1618–20}}, but no notices were taken of his death in diplomatic correspondence or newsletters on the continent, nor were any tributes published by European contemporaries. [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]]—who at the time held the post of [[Lord Chamberlain]], with authority over the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and directly in charge of Shakespeare as a [[Groom of the Chamber]]—made no note of his passing.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}{{efn|[[Stephen Greenblatt]], in an article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', points to the difference in social status: "A grand aristocrat … could [not readily] show a connection to a social nonentity—a bourgeois entrepreneur and playwright without Oxbridge honors or family distinction …."{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}}}

Shakespeare's works—both poetic and dramatic—had a rich history in print before the publication of the First Folio: from the first publications of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1593) and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' (1594), 78 individual printed editions of his works are known. {{circa|30%}} (23) of these editions are his poetry, and the remaining {{circa|70%}} (55) his plays. Counting by number of editions published before 1623, the best-selling works were ''Venus and Adonis'' (12 editions), ''The Rape of Lucrece'' (6 editions), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (6 editions). Of the 23 editions of the poems, 16 were published in [[octavo]]; the rest, and almost all of the editions of the plays, were printed in [[quarto]].{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} The quarto format was made by folding a large sheet of printing paper twice, forming 4 leaves with 8 pages. The average quarto measured {{convert|7|by|9|in|cm}} and was made up of {{circa|9}} sheets, giving 72 total pages.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Octavos—made by folding a sheet of the same size three times, forming 8 leaves with 16 pages—were about half as large as a quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} Since the cost of paper represented {{circa|50–75%}} of a book's total production costs,{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} octavos were generally cheaper to manufacture than quartos, and a common way to reduce publishing costs was to reduce the number of pages needed by compressing (using two columns or a smaller typeface) or abbreviating the text.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}}

Editions of individual plays were typically published in quarto and could be bought for 6[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.025|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) without a binding. These editions were primarily intended to be cheap and convenient, and read until worn out or repurposed as wrapping paper (or worse), rather than high quality objects kept in a library.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Customers who wanted to keep a particular play would have to have it bound, and would typically bind several related or miscellany plays into one volume.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=10}} Octavos, though nominally cheaper to produce, were somewhat different. From {{circa|1595–6}} (''Venus and Adonis'') and 1598 (''The Rape of Lucrece''), Shakespeare's narrative poems were published in octavo.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} In ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'', Tara L. Lyons argues that this was partly due to the publisher, [[John Harrison (stationer)|John Harrison]]'s, desire to capitalize on the poems' association with [[Ovid]]: the Greek classics were sold in octavo, so printing Shakespeare's poetry in the same format would strengthen the association.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} The octavo generally carried greater prestige, so the format itself would help to elevate their standing.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} Ultimately, however, the choice was a financial one: ''Venus and Adonis'' in octavo needed four sheets of paper, versus seven in quarto, and the octavo ''The Rape of Lucrece'' needed five sheets, versus 12 in quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} Whatever the motivation, the move seems to have had the intended effect: [[Francis Meres]], the first known literary critic to comment on Shakespeare, in his ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), puts it thus: "the sweete wittie soule of ''Ouid'' liues in mellifluous &amp; hony-tongued ''Shakespeare'', witnes his ''Venus'' an''d'' ''Adonis'', his ''Lucrece'', his sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=8–9}}

Publishing literary works in folio was not unprecedented. Starting with the publication of Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (1593) and ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' (1598), both published by [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]], there was a significant number of folios published, and a significant number of them were published by the men who would later be involved in publishing the First Folio.{{efn|[[Edward Fairfax]]'s translation of [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Godfrey of Bulloigne]]'' (1600), [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[Troia Britanica]]'' (1609), and [[Boccaccio]]’s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1620) was published in folio by [[William Jaggard|William]] and Isaac Jaggard; [[Montaigne]]’s ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (1603, 1613), [[Samuel Daniel]]’s ''[[Panegyricke Congratulatory]]'' (1603), [[Lucan]]’s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' (1614), and [[James Mabbe]]'s translation of [[Mateo Alemán]]’s ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache|The Rogue]]'' (1623) were published by [[Edward Blount]]; and [[John Smethwick]] published [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Ben Jonson folios|Works]]'' (1616), and [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''[[Poems (Drayton)|Poems]]'' (1619). All told, a quarter of the literary folios produced in London between 1600 and 1623 were the work of these three publishers.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=26}}}} But quarto was the typical format for plays printed in the period: folio was a prestige format, typically used, according to [[Fredson Bowers]], for books of "superior merit or some permanent value".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=1}} &lt;!-- TODO: Needs mention of Jonson's Folio, and perhaps a few words about Beaumont and Fletcher? Xover, 15 April 2018. --&gt;

==Printing==
The contents of the First Folio were compiled by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]];{{sfn|Edmondson|2015|pp=321–323}} the members of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] who published the book were the booksellers [[Edward Blount]] and the father/son team of [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]]. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] because he had published the questionable collection ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the [[False Folio]] affair). Indeed, his contemporary [[Thomas Heywood]], whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was "much offended with M. ''Jaggard'' (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name."{{sfn|Erne|2013|p=26}}

Heminges and Condell emphasised that the Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", asserting that Shakespeare's true words "are now offer'd to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them."

The paper industry in England was then in its infancy and the quantity of quality [[History of paper|rag paper]] for the book was imported from France.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=41}} It is thought that the [[typesetting]] and printing of the First Folio was such a large job that the King's Men simply needed the capacities of the Jaggards' shop. William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died a month before the book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac.

The First Folio's publishing syndicate also included two stationers who owned the rights to some of the individual plays that had been previously printed: [[William Aspley]] (''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'') and [[John Smethwick]] (''[[Love's Labour's Lost]],'' ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''). Smethwick had been a business partner of another Jaggard, William's brother John.

The printing of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623. It is possible that the printer originally expected to have the book ready early, since it was listed in the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622, but the catalog contained many books not yet printed by 1622, and the modern consensus is that the entry was simply intended as advance publicity.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=42–44}} The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Edward Dering]] (who purchased two); the [[Bodleian Library]], in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Third Folio]] became available in 1663/1664).{{sfn|Smith|1939|pp=257–264}}

==Contents==
The 36 plays of the First Folio occur in the order given below; plays that had never been published before 1623 are marked with an asterisk. Each play is followed by the type of source used, as determined by bibliographical research.{{sfn|Evans|1974}}&lt;!-- FIXME: This needs better, more up to date and specific, sourcing. This cite, as it stands, covers the entire list of plays below. So it should be replaced with specific cites to a modern edition for each play listed. Xover, 31 March 2018. --&gt;

The term ''[[foul papers]]'' refers to Shakespeare's working drafts of a play. When completed, a transcript or ''fair copy'' of the foul papers would be prepared, by the author or by a scribe. Such a manuscript would have to be heavily annotated with accurate and detailed stage directions and all the other data needed for performance, and then could serve as a ''[[prompt book]]'', to be used by the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] to guide a performance of the play. Any of these manuscripts, in any combination, could be used as a source for a printed text. On rare occasions a printed text might be annotated for use as a prompt book, as may have been the case with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The label Q''n'' denotes the ''n''th quarto edition of a play.

;Comedies
* 1 ''[[The Tempest]]'' * – the play was set into type from a manuscript prepared by [[Ralph Crane]], a professional [[scrivener]] employed by the King's Men. Crane produced a high-quality result, with formal act/scene divisions, frequent use of parentheses and hyphenated forms, and other identifiable features.
* 2 ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' * – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 3 ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 4 ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' * – probably another Ralph Crane transcript.
* 5 ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' * – probably typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers," lightly annotated.
* 6 ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' – typeset from a copy of the quarto, lightly annotated.
* 7 ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' – typeset from a corrected copy of Q1.
* 8 ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q2, well-annotated, possibly used as a prompt-book.
* 9 ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' – typeset from a lightly edited and corrected copy of Q1.
* 10 ''[[As You Like It]]'' * – from a quality manuscript, lightly annotated by a prompter.
* 11 ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' * – typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers," somewhat annotated, perhaps as preparation for use as a prompt-book.
* 12 ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' * – probably from Shakespeare's "foul papers" or a manuscript of them.
* 13 ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' * – typeset either from a prompt-book or a transcript of one.
* 14 ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' * – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
;Histories
* 15 ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' * – uncertain: a prompt-book, or "foul papers."
* 16 ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' – typeset from Q3 and Q5, corrected against a prompt-book.
* 17 ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' – typeset from an edited copy of Q5.
* 18 ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' – uncertain: some combination of manuscript and quarto text.
* 19 ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers."
* 20 ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' * – likely from an annotated transcript of the author's manuscript.
* 21 ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' – probably a Shakespearean manuscript used as a prompt-book.
* 22 ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' – like 2H6, probably a Shakespearean prompt-book.
* 23 ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' – a difficult case: probably typeset partially from Q3, and partially from Q6 corrected against a manuscript (maybe "foul papers").

* 25 ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' – probably typeset from the quarto, corrected with Shakespeare's "foul papers," printed after the rest of the Folio was completed.
* 26 ''[[Coriolanus]]'' * – set from a high-quality authorial transcript.
* 27 ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q3 that might have served as a prompt-book.
* 28 ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' – in essence a reprint of Q3.

* 30 ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' * – set from a prompt-book, or a transcript of a prompt-book.
* 31 ''[[Macbeth]]'' * – probably set from a prompt-book, perhaps detailing an adaptation of the play for a short indoor performance
* 32 ''[[Hamlet]]'' – one of the most difficult problems in the First Folio: probably typeset from some combination of Q2 and manuscript sources.
* 33 ''[[King Lear]]'' – a difficult problem: probably set mainly from Q1 but with reference to Q2, and corrected against a prompt-book.
* 34 ''[[Othello]]'' – another difficult problem: probably typeset from Q1, corrected with a quality manuscript.
* 35 ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' * – possibly "foul papers" or a transcript of them.
* 36 ''[[Cymbeline]]'' * – possibly another Ralph Crane transcript, or else the official prompt-book.

''Troilus and Cressida'' was originally intended to follow ''Romeo and Juliet'', but the typesetting was stopped, probably due to a conflict over the rights to the play; it was later inserted as the first of the tragedies, when the rights question was resolved. It does not appear in the table of contents.{{sfn|Halliday|1964}}{{pn|date=March 2018}}

==Introductory Poem==
[[Ben Jonson]] wrote a preface to the folio with this poem facing the Droeshout portrait:
{{Poemquote|text=This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut:
 Wherein the Grauer had a strife
 with Nature, to out-doo the life:
 O, could he but haue dravvne his vvit
 As vvell in brasse, as he hath hit
 His face; the Print vvould then surpasse
 All, that vvas euer vvrit in brasse.
 But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
 Not on his picture, but his Booke.

B.J.}}

==Compositors==
As far as modern scholarship has been able to determine,{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=113}} the First Folio texts were set into type by five compositors, with different spelling habits, peculiarities, and levels of competence. Researchers have labelled them A through E, A being the most accurate, and E an apprentice who had significant difficulties in dealing with manuscript copy. Their shares in typesetting the pages of the Folio break down like this:

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
! Comedies
! Histories
! Tragedies
! Total pages
|-
| "A"
| 74
| 80
| 40
| '''194'''
|-
| "B"
| 143
| 89
| 213
| '''445'''
|-
| "C"
| 79
| 22
| 19
| '''120'''
|-
|"D"
| {{frac|35|1|2}}

| '''{{frac|35|1|2}}'''
|-
|"E"
| 0
| 0
| {{frac|71|1|2}}
| '''{{frac|71|1|2}}'''
|}

Compositor "E" was most likely one John Leason, whose apprenticeship contract dated only from 4 November 1622. One of the other four might have been a John Shakespeare, of [[Warwickshire]], who apprenticed with Jaggard in 1610–17. ("Shakespeare" was a common name in Warwickshire in that era; John was no known relation to the playwright.)

== The First Folio and variants ==
[[File:First Folio VA.jpg|thumb|The First Folio ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London)]]
[[W. W. Greg]] has argued that [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or "book-holder" ([[prompter (theatre)|prompter]]) of the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], did the actual proofreading of the manuscript sources for the First Folio. Knight is known to have been responsible for maintaining and annotating the company's scripts, and making sure that the company complied with cuts and changes ordered by the [[Master of the Revels]].

Some pages of the First Folio – 134 out of the total of 900 – were proofread and corrected while the job of printing the book was ongoing. As a result, the Folio differs from modern books in that individual copies vary considerably in their typographical errors. There were about 500 corrections made to the Folio in this way.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=390}} These corrections by the typesetters, however, consisted only of simple typos, clear mistakes in their own work; the evidence suggests that they almost never referred back to their manuscript sources, let alone tried to resolve any problems in those sources. The well-known [[crux (literary)|cruxes]] in the First Folio texts were beyond the typesetters' capacity to correct.

The Folio was typeset and bound in "sixes" – 3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or gathering of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the "sixes" were assembled and bound together to make the book. The sheets were printed in 2-page formes, meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously on one side of one sheet of paper (which became the "outer" side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed on the other side of the same sheet (the "inner" side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be "cast off" – the compositors had to plan beforehand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare's works).{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=319}}

== Performing Shakespeare using the First Folio ==

Some Shakespeare directors and theatre companies producing Shakespeare believe that while modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, which are heavily edited and changed, are more readable, they remove possible actor cues found in the Folio, such as capitalization, different punctuation and even the changing or removal of whole words. Among the theatre companies that have based their production approach upon use of the First Folio was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]], which, in the early 1980s, began a studied approach to their stage productions relying upon the First Folio as their textual guide. In the 1990s, the First Folio was reissued in a paperback format more accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Moston|1995|p=vii}}{{fv|date=April 2018|reason=The introduction starts on page ix, so page vii must be some other prefatory matter, possibly the publisher's sales copy for the book. The cite also only plausibly covers the last sentence of this paragraph.}}

Today, many theatre companies and festivals producing the works of Shakespeare use the First Folio as the basis for their theatrical productions and training programmes, including London's Original Shakespeare Company, a theatre company which works exclusively from cue scripts drawn from the First Folio.{{sfn|Tucker|2002|p=}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}

However, what are now the widely accepted versions of these plays include lines taken from the Quartos, which are not in the First Folio. For instance, small passages of ''Hamlet'' are omitted – among them Horatio's line "A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye", and his subsequent speech beginning with "In the most high and palmy state of Rome, / A little ere the mightiest Julius fell..." Also missing is Hamlet's encounter with the Norwegian captain from Fortinbras's army in Act IV, Scene IV, along with perhaps the most important cut, the soliloquy "How all occasions do inform against me". ''Romeo and Juliet'' omits the prologue, with its famous line about "a pair of [[star-crossed]] lovers".

==Holdings, sales and valuations==
Jean-Christophe Mayer, in ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'' (2016), estimates the original retail price of the First Folio to be about 15[[Shilling (English coin)|s]] ({{inflation|UK|0.75|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for an unbound copy, and up to [[pound sterling|£]]1 ({{inflation|UK|1|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for one bound in [[calfskin]].{{efn|He also cites previous estimates from Anthony James West, based in part on unpublished estimates by Peter Blayney, that the publisher's cost was about 6s 8[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.33|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), and the wholesale price no more than 10s ({{inflation|UK|0.5|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{sfn|Mayer|2016|p=105}}&lt;!-- FIXME: The modern prices, generated by [[Template:inflation]], need citations. But [[Template:inflation-fn]] currently doesn't support short footnotes, and a few other problems, so that will have to be addressed first. Xover, 4 April 2018. --&gt;}} In terms of [[purchasing power]], "a bound folio would be about forty times the price of a single play and represented almost two months’ wages for an ordinary skilled worker."{{sfn|Mayer|2016|p=105}}

[[File:Bodleian First Folio Tragedy of Julius Caesar axc0719-0.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' from the Bodleian Library's first folio]]
It is believed that around 750 copies of the First Folio were printed, of which there are 235 known surviving copies.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|The Guardian|2016}}{{sfn|Folgerpedia|n.d.}} The [[British Library]] holds 5 copies. The [[National Library of Scotland]] holds a single copy, donated by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] in 1949.{{sfn|Vincent|2016}} An incomplete copy is on display at the [[Craven Museum &amp; Gallery]] in [[Skipton]], [[North Yorkshire]] and is accompanied by an audio narrative by [[Patrick Stewart]].{{sfn|BBC|2011}} The [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington, D.C. holds the world's largest collection with 82 copies. Another collection (12 copies) is held at [[Meisei University]] in [[Tokyo]], including the ''Meisei Copy'' (coded MR 774), said to be unique because of annotations by its reader.{{sfn|Meisei University|n.d.}} While most copies are held in university libraries or museums such as the copy held by the [[Brandeis University]] library since 1961,{{sfn|Farber|2013}} a few are held by public libraries. In the United States, the [[New York Public Library]] has six copies{{sfn|West|2003|p=222}} with the [[Boston Public Library]],{{sfn|West|2003|p=204}} [[Free Library of Philadelphia]],{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=721}} [[The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)]],{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=585}} the [[Lilly Library]] ([[Indiana University-Bloomington]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/regina-fraser-and-pat-johnson/an-extraordinary-library-_2_b_8210410.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallas Public Library]]{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=757}} each holding one copy.
The [[Huntington Library]] in Los Angeles County has four copies.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=230-240}} In Canada, there is only one known copy, located in the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]] of the [[University of Toronto]].{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=770–771}} The former Rosenbach copy, in its original binding, is now held at the [[Bodmer Library|Fondation Martin Bodmer]] in Switzerland.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=851–854}} The [[State Library of New South Wales]] holds copies of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Folios.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=772–773}}

The First Folio is one of the most valuable printed books in the world: a copy sold at [[Christie's]] in New York in October 2001 made $6.16 million [[Auction#Terminology|hammer price]] (then £3.73m).{{sfn|Christie's|2001}}

[[Oriel College, Oxford]], raised a conjectured £3.5 million from the sale of its First Folio to [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir Paul Getty]] in 2003.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death in 2016, the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] toured some of its 82 First Folios for display in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.{{sfn|Fessenden|2016}}

===Discoveries of previously unknown Folios===
On 13 July 2006, a complete copy of the First Folio owned by [[Dr Williams's Library]] was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] auction house. The book, which was in its original 17th-century binding, sold for £2,808,000, less than Sotheby's top estimate of £3.5 million. This copy is one of only about 40 remaining complete copies (most of the existing copies are incomplete); only one other copy of the book remains in private ownership.{{sfn|Iggulden|2006}}

On 11 July 2008, it was reported that a copy stolen from [[Durham University]], England, in 1998 had been recovered after being submitted for valuation at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. News reports estimated the folio's value at anywhere from £250,000 in total for the First Folio and all the other books and manuscripts stolen (''[[BBC News]]'', 1998), up to $30 million (''[[New York Times]]'', 2008).{{sfn|Collins|2008}} Although the book, once the property of [[John Cosin]] the [[Bishop of Durham]], was returned to the library, it had been mutilated and was missing its cover and title page.{{sfn|Wainwright|2010}} The folio was returned to public display on 19 June 2010 after its twelve-year absence.{{sfn|Macknight|2010}} Fifty-three-year-old Raymond Scott received an eight-year prison sentence for [[handling stolen goods]], but was acquitted of the theft itself.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2011|p=43}} A July 2010 BBC programme about the affair, ''Stealing Shakespeare'', portrayed Scott as a fantasist and petty thief.{{sfn|Rees|2010}} In 2013, Scott killed himself in his prison cell.{{sfn|BBC|2013}}

In November 2014, a previously unknown First Folio was found in a public library in [[Saint-Omer]], [[Pas-de-Calais]] in [[France]], where it had lain for 200 years.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|BBC|2014}} Confirmation of its authenticity came from Eric Rasmussen, of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], one of the world's foremost authorities on Shakespeare.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|BBC|2014}} The title page and introductory material are missing.{{sfn|BBC|2014}}{{sfn|Mulholland|2014}} The name "Neville", written on the first surviving page, may indicate that it once belonged to Edward Scarisbrick, who fled England due to [[Recusancy|anti-Catholic repression]], attended the Jesuit [[Saint-Omer College]], and was known to use that alias.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}} The only other known copy of a First Folio in France is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris.{{sfn|Mulholland|2014}}

In March 2016, [[Christie's]] announced that a previously unrecorded copy once owned by 19th-century collector Sir George Augustus Shuckburgh-Evelyn would be auctioned on 25 May 2016.{{sfn|Finnigan|2016}}

In April 2016 another new discovery was announced, a First Folio having been found in [[Mount Stuart House]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], [[Scotland]]. It was authenticated by [[Emma J. Smith|Professor Emma Smith]] of Oxford University.{{sfn|Coughlan|2016}} The Folio originally belonged to [[Isaac Reed]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

'''FriendsWithYou''' (FWY) is an art collaborative based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],&lt;ref name="Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complexmag.ca/art-design/2013/04/inside-friendswithyous-incredible-los-angeles-studio|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in Miami, [[Florida]], by Samuel Albert Borkson (b.1979, Plantation, Florida)&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/info/biography/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Biography|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arturo Sandoval III (b. 1976, Havana, Cuba) &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; in 2002, which seeks to redesign [[spirituality]], rituals, and religious acts for modern day usage and connectivity.&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://theholenyc.com/2011/06/10/friendwithyou|publisher= The Hole|title= FRIENDSWITHYOU |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FriendsWithYou’s mission coincides with their motto "Magic, Luck, and Friendship."&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/friendswithyou-inner-space_n_1151062.html|publisher= The Huffington Post|title= FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel|accessdate=July 12, 2013|first=Amanda|last=McCorquodale|date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaborative began by creating soft sculptures as a means to spread more accessible art like plush and wood toys,&lt;ref name="Friends With YOU in NYC"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://textileartscenterblog.com/friends-with-you-in-nyc/|publisher= Textile Arts Center|title= Friends With YOU in NYC|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as immersive art installations, fine art works including sculpture and painting, and are best known for their public art spectacles such as large-scale art installations, playgrounds, and performance pieces.&lt;ref name="Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called “Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://the305.com/2011/11/25/friends-with-you-opens-its-design-district-studio-for-art-basel-exhibition-called-inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown/#ixzz2TzX4Br6B|publisher= The305.com|title= Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called "Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.&lt;ref name="Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/02/interview-friendswithyou-discusses-their-artists-talk-with-mocatv-and-the-art-of-positivity|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, they have become internationally recognized with public exhibits and artworks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and The Americas.

FriendsWithYou Fine Art has been exhibited and/or included in the permanent collections of [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MOCA), the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Haus der Kulturen der Welt Museum Berlin]], and [[Galerie Perrotin|Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin]] among others.&lt;ref name="Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://sites.moca.org/thecurve/2013/02/15/magic-luck-and-friendship/ |publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2006, the [[Germany|German]] art press Die Gestalten Verlag published a FriendsWithYou [[monograph]] titled ''Friends With You Have Powers!''

==Evaluation and influence==
FriendsWithYou have explained that their art is meant to "activate the social interaction of people as exploded and refracted by the Internet and elaborate new modes of interpersonal relationships."&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"/&gt;
 
They use play as an artistic means to foster these relationships.&lt;ref name="Artists: FriendsWithYou"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://iloveoffset.com/stage/friendswithyou |publisher= iloveoffset.com |title= FriendsWithYou |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many FriendsWithYou works look like toys because they are meant for play as a means of interactive unstructured free association. FWY hopes that "through their artwork, the buried, neglected urges and yearnings that a seasoned art viewer may not expect to have activated; playfulness, laughter and inquisitiveness are triggered, with an end result of feeling connected."&lt;ref name="Artists Statement"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://friendswithyou.com/info|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Artists Statement|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FWY inverts the practice and usage of religious traditions, symbols, and spiritual practices through play to open a connection to the divine.&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity"/&gt;

Conceptually, FriendsWithYou’s experiential artwork is in conversation with [[Relational Aesthetics]] and the work of Jeff Koons, [[Takashi Murakami]], and [[Damien Hirst]].  The collective has been compared to Takashi Murakami for their "[[superflat]]" approach to art.&lt;ref name="Friends With You"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/arts-and-entertainment/article/friends-you|publisher= Broadsheet|title= Friends With You|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork and installations==
===Solo shows===
'''Inner Vision in Between''' was featured at the MCLEMOI Gallery in Sydney, Australia from February 15 to April 11, 2013. The exhibition themes ran from the playful to the spiritual. It was also described as a minimal, peaceful, stoic and occasionally foreboding journey from one chapter to another.&lt;ref name="Inner Vision In Between"/&gt;

'''In The Beginning''', featured at the Colette in Paris from August 29 to September 24, 2011. It consisted of bronze sculptures, a series of prints, including two exclusive edition prints solely for Colette, an animation video piece and limited run products, in addition to limited edition inflatable Malfi heads and Rainbow Mr. TTT bop bags.&lt;ref name="IN THE BEGINNING"/&gt;

''''Happy Rainbow''', installed at the Tuen Mun Town Plaza, in Hong Kong from July 22 to September 2, 2012 was a colorful interactive bounce house which also featured fiberglass, plush and resin sculpture installations.&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow – Friends With You"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.myplasticblog.com/art-shows/happy-rainbow-fwy/|publisher= myplasticblog.com|title= Happy Rainbow – FriendsWithYou|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow – Friends With You"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends With You ‘Happy Rainbow’ Exhibition in Hong Kong"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/friends-with-you-happy-rainbow-exhibition-in-hong-kong/|publisher= Acclaim Magazine|title= Friends With You ‘Happy Rainbow’ Exhibition in Hong Kong|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FWY designed the installation as a modern shrine which also embodies their themes of play and spirituality. "FWY hopes to evoke a spiritual connectivity that will enlighten all visitors. Each piece in the exhibition is charged with so much color and power that it brings great harmony to all who look upon it," the group wrote.&lt;ref name="Happy Rainbow"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/fwys-first-hong-kong-exhibition-happy-rainbow|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Happy Rainbow|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friendswithyou Blows Up Happy Rainbow In Hong Kong"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://knstrct.com/2012/08/13/friendswithyou-blows-up-happy-rainbow-in-hong-kong|publisher= knstrct.com|title= Friendswithyou Blows Up Happy Rainbow In Hong Kong|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''':)''' at the Hole from June 10 to August 6, 2011 &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; was FriendsWithYou’s first solo exhibition in New York and the inaugural show at the Hole’s new location. The show featured 22 FriendsWithYou artworks including a series of anthropomorphic figures created largely out of geometric abstractions made from Lasercut MDF, car paint and acrylic.  The show was described as "relentlessly cheerful," and “an interactive, experiential wonderland of pop-straction and participation.”
Much like Murakami, [[Arturo Herrera]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others FWY take a spiritual and serene approach to form and figure in the :) exhibition. The artists consider these works to be part of the “service art” movement, allowing for the viewer to easily understand their message and not be categorized as “pretentious art”.

'''Rainbow City''' was an interactive installation containing minimalist inflatable forms from 8' to 50' borrowing their aesthetics from toy-like geometries and designs.&lt;ref name="AOL Artists: Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.aolartists.com/initiatives/rainbow-city|publisher= AOL Artists|title= Rainbow City|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally commissioned in 2010 by the Luminato Arts Foundation in Toronto, Canada, Rainbow City was then exhibited at Art Basel Miami 2010 presented by Paper Magazine, Pharrell Williams, and Aol. About 20,000 people visited the installation and were able to participate by bouncing about inside the inflatable structures and wandering in and around the surreal landscape.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/friendswithyou-converts-art-basel-2010-into-a-rainbow-city |publisher= The Creators Project|title= FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2010 to open section 2 of the High Line in New York City, a collection of 40 air-filled sculptures filled 16,000 square feet of outdoor space in Chelsea.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's Rainbow City at the High Line Park"/&gt; It was FWY's first large scale interactive installation in New York City.&lt;ref name="RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psfk.com/2011/05/rainbow-city-aol-friendswithyous-urban-playground.html|publisher= psfk|title= RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://culturereport.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/art-collective-friendswithyou-bring-color-and-joy-to-new-york|publisher= The Culture Report|title= ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the artists, Rainbow City was created to allow the viewer to reinterpret spirituality.  The large totems represented self-reflective portraits, in line with FWY’s goal of evoking visitors to see their emotions and own self within the sculptural pieces. Visitors were encouraged to come and “be in awe of these large, reduced shaped and simple totems,” stated Arturo Sandoval III. By evoking play through very simple form, FriendsWithYou feels an almost religious scenario of connectivity is created in this interactive installation.&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends with Safewalls"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.safewalls.org/news/friendswithsafewalls/|publisher= Safewalls|title= Friends with Safewalls |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FriendsWithYou's Cloud City 3.jpg|thumb|right|'''Cloud City''']]'''Cloud City''' opened in 2005 at the MOCA warehouse during the annual Art Basel in Miami.

'''Cloudy''' is a video installation that launched exclusively on "'[[Pharrell Williams]]'"'s "'[[i am OTHER]]'" "'[[YouTube]]'" channel. "Cloudy" is a short by artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The animated piece is an exploration into the clouds; a sweet, visual soundscape that takes the viewer through a personal journey into the sky. It invites viewers to follow a cast of clouds and raindrops through an entrancing adventure. FriendsWithYou explores animism, giving the main cast of characters a soul. The purpose of the piece is to transcend the viewer to a peaceful and joyous state. Clouds singing and performing their duties in a joyful manner show us that everything in our world has a role and a purpose.&lt;ref name="CLOUDY"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kySziocrOmU |author1 =Samuel Borkson |author2 =Arturo Sandoval III |title= Friends With You - Cloudy |date =18 July 2012 |website =YouTube |accessdate =23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters and toys==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GWGGroup.jpg|thumb|The ''Good Wood Gang'' from 2005]] --&gt;
FriendsWithYou refers to its toy-like characters as "friends."&lt;ref name="Friends with Safewalls"/&gt;

The friends include:
* Malfi
* Mr. TTT burger
* The boy
* Rainbow King

As one of their first projects, FWY created a soft sculptural toy line using their friends characters that was intended to empower collectors with interactive "pseudo-amulets" at an accessible price. Each toy or soft sculpture is produced in a small edition, typically not re-released, and given a persona described in a booklet-style tag affixed to it.&lt;ref name="Friends"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/plush/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Friends|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gazette des Beaux-Arts.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Gazette des Beaux-Arts''&lt;br /&gt;First year, volume III, 1 July 1859.]]
The '''''Gazette des Beaux-Arts''''' was a French art review, founded in 1859 by Édouard Houssaye, with [[Charles Blanc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Orton|author2=Griselda Pollock|title=Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxENAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=14 July 2016|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4399-4|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its first chief editor. Assia Visson Rubinstein was chief editorial secretary under the direction of  George Wildenstein from 1936 until 1960. Her papers, which include all editions of the ''Gazette'' from this period, are intact at the [[Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne]] in [[Dorigny]]. The ''Gazette'' was a world reference work on art history for nearly 100 years - one other editor in chief, from 1955 to 1987, was [[Jean Adhémar]]. It was bought in 1928 by the Wildenstein family, whose last representative was [[Daniel Wildenstein]], its director from 1963 until his death in 2001. The magazine was published monthly and was headquartered in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazette des Beaux-Arts [France]|url=http://arts-search.com/journals21.htm|work=Arts: Search|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review closed in 2002.

'''Genre fiction''', also known as '''popular fiction''', is a term used in the book-trade for [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specifically [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewArticle.asp?id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Genre fiction is generally distinguished from [[literary fiction]], a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]], publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]], and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by [[André Gide]] as "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney. http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-09-10/features/8903020475_1_inspector-maigret-georges-simenon-detective-story&lt;/ref&gt;

The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Genre and the marketing of fiction==

In the publishing industry the term "category fiction" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as [[Western fiction|Western]] or mystery.

The uncategorized section is known in the industry as "general fiction", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Adult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public,&lt;ref name=wollheim200606&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/06Wollheim.html|title=Locus Online: Betsy Wollheim interview excerpts|magazine=Locus |date=June 2006 | access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Stephanie|title=Forget 'serious' novels, I've turned to a life of crime|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=STASIO|first=MARILYN|title=Next Victim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Stasio-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=KAKUTANI|first=MICHIKO|title=Critic's Notebook; Kill!

Though a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

==History of genres==
{{See also|History of fantasy|History of science fiction}}
[[Genre]] began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Poetry]], [[prose]], and [[drama]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story.  Among the genres were the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in poetry and [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] for plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hadas, Moses (1950). ''A History of Greek Literature''. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods other genres such as the [[chivalric romance]], [[opera]], and [[prose fiction]] developed.

Though the [[novel]] is often seen as a modern genre, [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web|title=Literary critic Ian Watt dies after a long illness|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/99/991217watt.html|website=Stanford News Service|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been described as possessing "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", from the time of both [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p. 1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "romance" is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romance]]s of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.xxv-xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its "romance" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the [[mass-marketing]] of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the [[gothic novel]], [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[adventure novel]], [[historical romance]], and the [[detective novel]]. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction [[romance novel]]s in [[literary fiction]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, including [[Samuel Richardson]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and the novels of [[Jane Austen]] such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813).&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Regis, ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The genres==
{{mainlist|List of literary genres}}
The following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:

===Crime===
{{Main article|Crime fiction|Detective fiction}}
Crime fiction is the [[literary genre]] that fictionalises [[crime]]s, their detection, criminals, and their [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is usually distinguished from [[Literary fiction|mainstream]] fiction and other genres such as [[historical fiction]] or [[science fiction]], but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple [[subgenres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=990082541924074;res=IELAPA|title = May I Suggest Murder?: An Overview of Crime Fiction for Readers' Advisory Services Staff|last = Franks|first = Rachel|date = 2011|journal = Australian Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|volume = 60|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[detective fiction]] (such as the [[whodunit]]), [[courtroom drama]], [[hardboiled|hard-boiled]] fiction, [[mystery fiction]], and [[legal thriller]]s. [[Suspense]] and mystery are key elements to the genre.

===Fantasy===
{{Main article|Fantasy|History of fantasy|Fantasy literature}}
[[Fantasy]] is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] that uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or other [[supernatural]] elements as a main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element, [[Theme (literature)|theme]], or [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. Many works within the genre take place in [[imaginary world]]s where magic and [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]] are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of [[speculative fiction]]. In [[popular culture]], the fantasy genre predominantly features a [[Medievalism|medieval]]-type setting.

===Romance===
{{Main article|Romance novel}}
The [[romance novel]] or "romantic novel" primarily focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two&amp;nbsp;people, and must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web   | title = The Romance Genre Overview | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | url =http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=578  | accessdate = November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of the romance novel including [[fantasy]], [[Historical romance|historical]], [[science fiction]], same sex romantic fiction, and [[paranormal fiction]].

There is a [[literary fiction]] form of romance, which [[Walter Scott]] defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Romance Writers of America''{{'s}} data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582 Romance Writers of America]&lt;/ref&gt; the most important subgenres are: [[Category romance|Contemporary series romance]], [[Contemporary romance]], [[Historical romance]], [[Paranormal romance]], [[Romantic suspense]], [[Inspirational fiction|Inspirational romance]], Romantic suspense (series).
*Other: [[chick-lit]], [[erotic romance novels|erotic romance]], [[women's fiction]], [[Young Adult Romance Literature|Young adult romance]].

===Science fiction===
{{Main article|Science fiction}}
Science fiction is a [[genre]] of [[speculative fiction]] dealing with [[imagination|imaginative]] concepts such as [[future|futuristic]] [[science]] and [[technology]], [[spaceflight|space travel]], [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], [[faster than light travel]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] and [[extraterrestrial life]]. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other [[innovation]]s, and has been called a "literature of ideas".&lt;ref name="Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marg Gilks |author2=Paula Fleming |author3=Moira Allen | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas | work = | publisher =WritingWorld.com | year =2003 | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually eschews the [[supernatural]], and unlike the related genre of [[fantasy]], historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of [[science|science-based fact or theory]] at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506221319/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jenkins_mi.html |title=Media and Imagination: A Short History of American Science Fiction |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Misa |url=http://misabuckley.com/does-the-science-in-science-fiction-matter/ |title=Does the Science in Science Fiction Matter? |publisher=Misa Buckley |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western===
{{Main article|Western fiction}}
Western fiction is defined primarily by being set in the [[Western United States|American West]] in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen ([[cowboy]]s). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.

===Inspirational===
{{Main article|Inspirational fiction}}
Inspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes.  It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians.  Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.

===Horror===
{{Main article|Horror fiction}}
[[Horror fiction]] aims to frighten or disgust its readers.  Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required.  Early horror took much inspiration from [[Romanticism]] and [[Gothic fiction]].  Modern horror, such as [[cosmic horror]] and [[splatterpunk]], tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit.  Horror is often mixed with other genres.

==Critical appraisal and controversy==
Although frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with [[Stephen King]] being awarded the [[National Book Award|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]];&lt;ref name=natbook&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/amerletters.html "Distinguished Contribution to American Letters "], National Book Foundation, Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit.  Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Literary Revolution in the Supermarket Aisle: Genre Fiction Is Disruptive Technology|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/|work=Time|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[the Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Colin |title=King &amp; I: Stephen King and a Balanced Diet |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414150715/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]] described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. [[Graham Greene]] at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/03/biography.grahamgreene|title=More Sherry trifles|author=Ian Thomson|publisher=
The Observer|date=3 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of "suspense-filled stories of detection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_G2mAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=23|title=Graham Greene: The Major Novels|author=Lynette Kohn|publisher=Stanford University Press|date= 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acclaimed during his lifetime, he was shortlisted in 1966&lt;ref name="nobelprize1966"&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/1966.html Candidates for the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref name=Prize&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJtz0iWO4O4C&amp;pg=PA364#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=264|title=Encyclopedia of the Essay|author=Robert C. Steensma|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[BBC]] defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=BBC denies 'sneering' at genre fiction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/21/bbc-genre-fiction?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Man Booker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Science fiction author hits out at Booker judges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/18/science-fiction-booker-prize|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Book Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=National Book Awards: Genre fiction dissed again|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/11/national_book_awards_genre_fiction_dissed_again/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. 

Some critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, K., Mullin, J.B., &amp; Mar, R.A. (2013). "What you read matters: The role of fiction genre in prediction interpersonal sensitivity". ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, And The Arts'', 7(4), 370-376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century British and Irish genre fiction==

{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[Sir John Barrow]]'s descriptive [[The Eventful History of the Mutiny and Piratical Seizure of HMS Bounty|1831 account]] of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] immortalised the Royal Navy ship {{HMS|Bounty}} and her people. The legend of [[Dick Turpin]] was popularised when the 18th-century English [[highwayman]]'s exploits appeared in the novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' in 1834.

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).

[[Penny dreadful]] publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous [[Sweeney Todd]]. The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' 1865, and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s "[[The Vampyre]]" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p.99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]], yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work ''[[Dracula]]'' and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire [[Count Dracula]], with the [[vampire hunter]] [[Abraham Van Helsing]] his arch-enemy. ''Dracula'' has been attributed to a number of [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].

[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' [[archenemy]] [[Professor Moriarty]], is widely considered to be the first true example of a [[supervillain]], while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr John H. Watson]].

The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novels]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' 1894, and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]'', 1898.

[[F. Anstey]]'s [[comic novel]] ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river [[Thames]]. Grossmith brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] &amp; [[Weedon Grossmith|Weedon]]'s ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.

==20th-century genre fiction==

===Early 20-century===
[[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]' ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' (1903), defined the [[spy novel]] and Follett has also called it "the first modern [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]".&lt;ref name=follett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ken-follett.com/suspense/index.html |title=The Art of Suspense |first=Ken |last=Follett |work=ken-follett.com |year=2016 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma Orczy]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the [[French Revolution]]ary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her "reckless daredevil" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|musical]] and other media. Baroness Orczy's character ''[[The Old Man in the Corner]]'' (1908) was among the earliest [[armchair detective]]s to be created. Her short stories about ''[[Lady Molly of Scotland Yard]]'' (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.

[[John Buchan]] wrote the [[adventure novel]]s on ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'' (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of [[Richard Hannay]], of which the first, ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the [[interwar period]], exemplified by the series of [[H. C. McNeile]] with ''[[Bulldog Drummond]]'' (1920), and [[Leslie Charteris]], whose many books chronicled the adventures of [[Simon Templar]], alias ''[[Simon Templar#Publishing history|The Saint]]''.

[[Image:Agatha Christie.png|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Agatha Christie]]]]

The [[medievalist]] scholar [[M. R. James]] wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.

This was called the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]]. [[Agatha Christie]], a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]], made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative [[twist ending]] had a significant impact on the genre), ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937) and ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939). Other female writers dubbed "Queens of crime" include [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] ([[gentleman detective]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]), [[Margery Allingham]] ([[Albert Campion]], supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/campion.htm|title=The Great Detectives: Albert Campion|work=Strand Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and New Zealander [[Ngaio Marsh]] ([[Roderick Alleyn]]). [[Georgette Heyer]] recreated the [[historical romance]] genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).

A major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by Scottish writer [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]], first published in 1920. It combines [[fantasy]], philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm Book Review: A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) by David Lindsay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215000000/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |date=December 15, 2014 }} – Review by Paul M. Kieniewicz 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Space Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Lindskoog – [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=882 „A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower“].&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he read the book "with avidity", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookladysblog.com/2011/08/17/the-top-ten-books-that-influenced-j-r-r-tolkien/|title=thebookladysblog.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] in 1968.

From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal [[literary]] discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "[[Inklings]]". Its leading members were the major [[high fantasy|fantasy]] novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Lewis is known for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1950–1956) and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'' (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977).

===Later 20th-century===
In [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] writing, [[Ian Fleming]] created the character [[James Bond 007]] in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953), ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954), ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958), ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959), ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' (1961), ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1962), and nine short story works.

In contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, [[John le Carré]] was an author of [[spy fiction|spy novels]] who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. [[Frederick Forsyth]] writes thriller novels, including ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' (1971), ''[[The Odessa File]]'' (1972), ''[[The Dogs of War (novel)|The Dogs of War]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1984). [[Ken Follett]] writes spy thrillers, his first success being ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' (1978), followed by ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'' (1980), as well as historical novels, notably ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (1989), and its sequel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'' (2007). [[Elleston Trevor]] is remembered for his 1964 adventure story ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', while the thriller novelist [[A. J. Quinnell|Philip Nicholson]] is best known for ''[[Man on Fire (Quinnell novel)|Man on Fire]]''. [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958), is a Cold War thriller.

[[War novel]]s include [[Alistair MacLean]] thriller's ''[[The Guns of Navarone (novel)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1957), ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), and [[Jack Higgins]]' ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1975). [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[sea story|nautical]] historical novels feature the ''[[Aubrey–Maturin series]]'' set in the [[Royal Navy]], the first being ''[[Master and Commander]]'' (1969).

The "father of [[Wicca]]", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], began propagating his own version of [[witchcraft]] in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the [[New Forest coven]] in 1939, Gardner published his books ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. [[Ronald Welch]]'s [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] winning novel ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the [[Third Crusade]], featuring the Christian leader and King of England [[Richard the Lionheart]].

In crime fiction, the [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]] of [[Ruth Rendell]] and [[P. D. James]] are popular.

[[Nigel Tranter]] wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; [[Robert the Bruce]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#Robert the Bruce trilogy|The Bruce Trilogy]]'', and [[William Wallace]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#The Wallace|The Wallace]]'' (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.

G. Ballard]] (born 1930) "became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the 'New Wave' science fiction writers".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; A later major figure in science fiction was [[Iain M.

'''Gilbert Arthur à Beckett''' (1837 – October 15, 1891) was an [[England|English]] writer.

== Biography ==
Beckett was born at Portland House [[Hammersmith]], on 7 April 1837, the eldest son of the civil servant and humorist [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]] and the composer [[Mary Anne à Beckett]], daughter of Joseph Glossop, clerk of the cheque to the hon. corps of gentlemen-at-arms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
His brother was [[Arthur William à Beckett]]. 
He graduated from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Oxford]], as a Westminster scholar in 1860.
He was entered at [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 15 October 1857, but gave his attention chiefly to drama, producing ''Diamonds and Hearts'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1867; this was followed by other light comedies.  
His adaptation of a French operetta by [[Émile Jonas]] called ''The Two Harlequins'' opened the new [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] in 1868, together with his distant cousin, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s, ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and another piece.

Beckett's pieces include numerous [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s and [[pantomime]]s, the libretti of ''Savonarola'' (Hamburg, 1884) and ''The Canterbury Pilgrims'' (Drury Lane, 1884) for the music of Dr. [[C. V. Stanford]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
With the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], Beckett wrote the operetta ''Two Foster Brothers'' ([[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]], 1877).

In 1879, he had been asked by [[Tom Taylor]], the editor of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of ''Punch.'' 
Three years later he was 'appointed to the Table.' 
The ''Punch'' dinners 'were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of [[Gower Street station]], rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punch's staircase, a matter of painful exertion'. 
To ''Punch'' he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boy's sensational shocker (March 1882), and he developed Jerrold's idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading 'How we advertise now.' 
The idea of one of Sir [[John Tenniel]]'s best cartoons for ''Punch,'' entitled 'Dropping the Pilot,' illustrative of Bismarck's resignation in 1889, was due to him.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

Apart from his work on 'Punch,' he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds' entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Happy Land'', showing the impersonation of Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', March 22, 1873]]
On 3 March 1873, ''[[The Happy Land]]'' was given at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]''. 
In this amusing piece of banter three statesmen (Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton) were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing 'Mr. G.,' 'Mr. L.,' and 'Mr. A.' were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their 'make-up.'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

In the following year, he furnished the 'legend' to [[Herman Merivale]]'s tragedy 'The White Pilgrim,' first given at the Court in February 1874. 
At the close of his life he furnished the 'lyrics' and most of the book for the operetta 'La Cigale,' which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

In 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

==Legacy==
''Punch'' devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph 'Wearing the white flower of a blameless life' (24 Oct. 1891). His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of 'The Mahogany Tree' (''Punch'', Jubilee Number, 18 July 1887), and likenesses were also given in the 'Illustrated London News' and in Spielmann's 'History of Punch' (1895).{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}} 
==Family==
He married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896 Mr. Hugh Clifford, C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

The term '''''hamartia''''' derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν ''hamartánein'', which means "to miss the mark" or "to err".&lt;ref&gt;"Hamartia". ''Merriam-Webster.com''. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamartia: (Ancient Greek: ἁμαρτία) Error of Judgement or Tragic Flaw. "Hamartia". ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often associated with [[Greek tragedy]], although it is also used in [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene J. "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" ''Laval théologique et philosophique''. 29.3 (1973) 243–255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Hamartia'' as it pertains to [[Play (theatre)|dramatic literature]] was first used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In [[tragedy]], ''hamartia'' is commonly understood to refer to the [[protagonist|protagonist’s]] error or '''tragic flaw''' that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad.  

What qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a [[wrongdoing]]. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.

== In Aristotle's ''Poetics'' ==
[[File:6Parts Image.pdf|thumb|A list of 
the six parts of Aristotle's Greek tragedy]]
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|"Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure"—click to view a larger version]]
Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The source of ''hamartia'' is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by [[Aristotle]].

{{quote|Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e. the sort of thing they seek or avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of ''Poetics'', [[Francis Fergusson]] describes ''hamartia'' as the inner quality that initiates, as in [[Dante|Dante's]] words, a "movement of spirit" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.htmlThe Internet Classics Archive] by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Jules Brody, however, argues that "it is the height of [[irony]] that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of ''hamartia''.  Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, [[Immoral|moral deficiency]], or the like.  ''Hamartia'' is a morally neutral non-[[normative]] term, derived from the verb ''hamartano'', meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'.  And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite.  ''Hamartia'' may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information.  Finally, ''hamartia'' may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success."&lt;ref&gt;Jules Brody, "Fate, Philology, Freud," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 38.1 (April 2014): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Greek tragedy]], for a story to be "of adequate magnitude" it involves characters of high rank, [[reputation |prestige]], or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes ''hamartia'' as the quality of a [[tragic hero]] that generates that optimal balance.

{{quote|...the character between these two extremes&amp;nbsp;– that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Christian theology ==
{{Main |Hamartiology}}
''Hamartia'' is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]]. The Hebrew (''chatá'') and its Greek equivalent (''àµaρtίa''/''hamartia'') both mean "missing the mark" or "off the mark".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2398&amp;t=KJV Strong's]'', bibclassic.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G266 Strong's]'', blueletterbible.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miss+the+mark Legal Dictionary]'', thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are four basic usages for ''hamartia'': 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes used to mean acts of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] "by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions" as in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5:12, "all have sinned".&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes applied to the [[fall of man]] from original righteousness that resulted in humanity's innate propensity for sin, that is [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" in ''Laval théologique et philosophique.'' 29.3 (1973) 243-255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014 and&lt;br/&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as in Romans 3:9, everyone is "under the power of sin".&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# A third application concerns the "weakness of the flesh" and the free will to resist sinful acts. "The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from ''the weakness of the flesh''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Fifty Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions'' (J. Heptinstall for Henry Mortlock, 1707), 525. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=kSVWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22weakness+of+the+flesh%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s &lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes "personified".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromiley, ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'' (Eerdmans, 1985), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to ''hamartia'' (sin).

== Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention ==
[[Aristotle]] mentions ''hamartia'' in ''Poetics''. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (''hamartia''). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as ''tragic flaw'' or ''tragic error''.

===Critical argument for flaw===
[[Poetic justice]] describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol, 125&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of ''hamartia'' as a vice to be punished&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol,12,125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Rymer. (2014). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514581/Thomas-Rymer&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phèdre'', Racine's adaptation of Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', is an example of French Neoclassical use of ''hamartia'' as a means of punishing vice.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, B. ''The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama'' 5th ed. 444-463. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Jean. ''Phèdre'', Harvard Classics, Vol. 26, Part 3. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/26/3/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Racine]] says in his Preface to ''Phèdre'', as translated by R.C. Knight:

{{quote|The failings of love are treated as real failings. The passions are offered to view only to show all the ravage they create. And vice is everywhere painted in such hues, that its hideous face may be recognized and loathed.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen,446&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The play is a tragic story about a [[royal family]]. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Euripedes. ''Hippolytus'', Harvard Classics, 8.7. Web. 8 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/8/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical argument for error===
In her 1963 ''[[Modern Language Review]]'' article, ''The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?'', Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of ''Poetics'' regarding ''hamartia'' as both error and "defect in character". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a "natural" expression to describe a flaw in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Samuel H., Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, New York 41911&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' of 1904 which she contends is misleading:

{{quote|...the comparatively innocent hero still shows some marked imperfection or defect, irresolution, precipitancy, pride, credulousness, excessive simplicity, excessive susceptibility to sexual emotion and the like...his weakness or defect is so intertwined with everything that is admirable in him...&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, A. C. 1851-1935. Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures On Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. London: Macmillan and co., limited, 1904. Web, 13 Dec. 2014. http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000240890;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Oedipus the King]]''. 

Hyde observes that students often state "thinking too much" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. 

In ''[[Oedipus the King]],'' she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation.   
 
In his 1978 ''[[Classical World (journal)|Classical World]]'' article ''Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus'', Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place ''hamartia's'' definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, [[Atë]], or divine intervention, plays in ''hamartia''.  The Butcher translation of "Poetics" references ''hamartia'' as both a "single great error", and "a single great defect in character", prompting critics to raise arguments. 

Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Leon. "Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus". ''The Classical World'', 72.1 (Sep., 1978), 3-12. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4348969&lt;/ref&gt; Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' ''hamartia'', "no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect."&lt;ref&gt;P. van Braam, "Aristotle's Use of Ἁμαρτία" ''The Classical Quarterly'', 6.4 (Oct., 1912), 266-272. London: Cambridge UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/635946&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. 

O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;Hey, O. "ἁμαρτία Zur Bedeutungsgeschichte des Wortes" ''Philologus'' 83 1-15, (1928). Web. 7 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of ''hamartia'' in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and [[Homer]]. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite ''hamartia'' as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, J.M. "Hamartia." Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy. Amsterdam, Adolf M. Hakkert, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical arguments on divine intervention===

J.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian ''hamartia''. Golden disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer observes that the Messenger in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' says, "He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by "dark powers" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. 

Dawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic ''[[dénouement]]'' can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. 

Golden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that ''hamartia'' principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from ''hamartia'', in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heavy metal bass''' is the use of the [[bass guitar]] (also called "electric bass") in the [[rock music]] genres of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]]. The bassist is part of the [[rhythm section]] in a heavy metal band, along with the [[Drum kit|drummer]], [[rhythm guitar]]ist and, in some bands, a [[Keyboard (music)|keyboard player]]. The prominent role of the bass is key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] is a central element of metal. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music "heavy".&lt;ref name=W24&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The bass plays a "... more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock."&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2009), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal bassists play many different types of [[bassline]]s, depending on the subgenre they are playing in and their personal playing style. Metal bass lines vary in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation for the band's sound to doubling complex [[riff]]s and [[lick (music)|licks]] along with the [[lead guitar]] and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's [[Cliff Burton]] with his emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 "Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass"]. ''Bass Player'', February 2005. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, such as [[Lemmy Kilmister]] of [[Motörhead]] and [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]]. Some metal bassists sing [[backup vocals]] while they play bass.

==Roles and playing styles==
[[File:Priest feast 36 - Ian Hill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bass guitarist [[Ian Hill]] from the heavy metal band [[Judas Priest]]. A red [[Plectrum|pick]] can be seen in his plucking hand.]]
Most metal bassists play by plucking the strings with their fingers or by [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. Using a pick enables bassists to play rapid repeated notes and fast basslines. While the types of [[bass line]]s vary in different metal subgenres, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the [[chord progression|harmonic framework]] with bass notes that emphasize the roots of the chords and, along with the [[drum kit|drums]] and [[rhythm guitar]], establishing the beat. The bass is also used a solo instrument in some metal styles. While four-string basses (tuned E, A, D, G from lowest string to highest string) are the most common, since the 1990s, some metal bassists have used five-string basses for added lower range—a low "B". Five string basses are used in [[nu metal]], to complement the [[downtuned guitar]]s use by the rhythm guitarists. Most metal bassists play with fretted instruments, which have metal frets on the fingerboard. However, there are a few bassists such as [[Steve DiGiorgio]] who use [[fretless bass]]es.

Most of the time, metal bass players play basslines which consist of a single note played at a time; that is, without playing multiple notes at the same time to form [[Guitar chord|chord]]s, the way a [[rhythm guitar]]ist would on an [[electric guitar]]. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. [[Robert Trujillo]] of [[Metallica]] is known for playing "massive chords" &lt;ref&gt;Warwick Robert Trujillo Signature Bass.

"Robert Trujillo Demands Something Solid" Available at: www.rottenbass.com/warwick-robert-trujillo-signature-bass-57 Accessed on June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and "chord-based harmonics" &lt;ref&gt;Metallica Bassist Robert Trujillo Funding Jaco Pastorius Biopic
Posted 06/04/2012 by Damian Fanelli Available online at: www.guitarworld.com/metallica-bassist-robert-trujillo-funding-jaco-pastorius-biopic Accessed on June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on the bass. [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]] often played [[power chord]]s in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm|title=We Do Not Bend The Knee. Motorhead Interview|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66kjEY0ay?url=http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Soloing===
While bass guitar solos are much less common in metal than [[guitar solo]]s for electric guitar, some metal bassists do play solos. Bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. Bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. A small number of metal bassists do two-handed [[tapping]] styles in which they use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Players noted for this soloing technique include [[Cliff Burton]] and [[shred guitar]]-style bassist [[Billy Sheehan]]. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Good Times Bad Times]]", the first song on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]], contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s bassist, [[John Deacon]], occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song "[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]". [[Metallica]]'s 1983 debut ''[[Kill Em All]]'' includes the song "[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]," consisting entirely of a bass solo played by [[Cliff Burton]]. [[Manowar]]'s bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] uses special [[piccolo bass]] for his extremely fast bass solos like "Sting of the Bumblebee" and "William's Tale".

Heavy metal bass players such as [[Geezer Butler]] ([[Black Sabbath]]), [[Alex Webster]] ([[Cannibal Corpse]]), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Blind Illusion]]) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. In both published [[Van Halen]] concert videos, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. When playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use [[Effects unit|effects]] such as [[fuzz bass]] or a  [[wah-wah pedal]] to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.

===Training===
[[File:Steve Harris 521.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] from [[Iron Maiden]] performing in 2008.]]
There is much less formal training available in college and university for metal bass, the way there is for bass guitarists learning [[jazz]] and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, [[R&amp;B]], etc.). Many metal bass players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands, which may include [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s. Metal bassists may be able to take lessons from expert metal players or teachers. They may also be able to adapt techniques from other genres to the metal genre. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s and 2000s, instructional DVDs and YouTube videos on how to play metal bass.

===Roles===
Metal bassists play in groups ranging in size from the [[power trio]] (guitar, bass and drums, with one or more of the members singing) to larger bands with multiple guitarists, keyboards, a bassist, a drummer and a vocalist. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, a role that [[Lemmy Kilminster]] of [[Motörhead]] did, and which [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]] and [[Grutle Kjellson]] of [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] continue to do. Some metal bassists sing [[backup vocals]] while they play bass. Some metal bassists are also [[bandleader]]s or [[songwriter]]s for their bands examples being [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] and [[Nikki Sixx]]. In a few cases, traditional metal group bass players have also played another instrument, such as [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who played [[Hammond organ]] on some songs or the bassists from mainstream metal bands such as [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] who use a [[pedal keyboard]], which is played with the feet.

Professional metal bassists may have a [[guitar technician#bass guitar technician|bass technician]] who tunes their basses before and during a performance, sets up the speaker cabinets, amplifiers and effects units, and performs routine maintenance on the instruments and equipment (e.g., changing strings, replacing speakers, replacing amplifier [[Vacuum tube|tubes]], etc.).

Almost all of the most well-known metal bassists are male.

Women have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the "... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion." Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;

==Equipment==

===Basses===
Some metal bassists use unusually-shaped instruments, such as [[Gene Simmons]] from [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], who had an instrument custom made in the shape of an axe, or those who use instruments like [[ES Guitars]]' Avenger, which has a jagged design. Many metal bassists use electric basses that are used in other rock genres, such as the [[Fender Precision]] bass.

===Amplifiers and effects===
Heavy metal bassists use many different brands of [[Bass instrument amplification|bass amplifiers]] and [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]s to make the instrument sound loud enough on stage. Bass players also use their amplifier's preamp, gain, overdrive (if present) and tone controls to create their unique personal bass sound. In some genres of music, such as folk and small combo jazz, the other instruments are often acoustic and so bass players in these styles may not need large, powerful bass amps. However, in heavy metal live performances, [[loudness]]—an "onslaught of sound," in sociologist [[Deena Weinstein]]'s description—is considered vital.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a loud volume in metal bands is even more paramount in large performance venues, such as stadiums. To get a loud enough bass sound to compete with the loudly amplified electric guitars and the large drum kits used in metal, metal bassists typically use large bass speaker cabinets stacked on top of each other–"bass stacks"–powered by high-wattage amplifiers. Traditional heavy metal bands were early users of "bass stacks". Bassist [[Alex Webster]] from the death metal band [[Cannibal Corpse]] plays with two 8x10 speaker cabinets (each cabinet contains eight 10" speakers).

One early bass stack was the 300-watt [[Ampeg SVT|Super Vacuum Tube (SVT)]] amplifier head, which was intended for large performance venues. The SVT was intended for use with one or two speaker cabinets containing eight 10" speakers. Some metal bassists use [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers, which were the dominant active electronic components in bass amplifiers manufactured until the early 1970s. Many bass players believe that tube amplifiers produce a "warmer" or more "natural" sound than solid state amplifiers when lightly or moderately [[fuzz bass|overdriven]], and more pleasing distortion characteristics when heavily overdriven.

Some metal bassists play with a [[fuzz bass]] tone, which is obtained by overdriving the bass signal. Cliff Burton of Metallica used fuzz bass. Lemmy Kilmister, the bassist for Motörhead, obtains a natural fuzz bass tone by overdriving his twin 100 watt Marshall Bass stacks. Fuzz bass can also be obtained with a bass overdrive pedal or an "overdrive" or distortion effect built into their bass amp. The Peavey Century 200 has an onboard "distortion" effect on the second channel. The Peavey VB-2 also has built-in overdrive. Aguilar Amplification's AG 500 bass head is a two-channel amplifier, one of which offers a "saturation" control for overdrive. Metal bassists may also use other [[Effects unit|effects]] to alter their bass sound, such as a [[wah pedal]] (e.g., Cliff Burton) or an [[audio compressor]] to smooth out the sound.

The picture measures 65.5 × 77.3 cm. and has the accession number 1795.
In the 19th century, the painting was also known  as ''Triumph of Homeopathy.''&lt;ref name="gtg_4_1"&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url =  | title = Государственная Третьяковская галерея — каталог собрания | orig-year = | agency = {{nobr|Я.

==History==
The allegorical image&lt;ref name="gtg_4_1" /&gt; ''Homeopathy Looks at the Horrors of Allopathy'' was painted by Alexander Beideman in Munich in 1857.&lt;ref name="leonov"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Верещагина, Алла Глебовна |title=Александр Егорович Бейдеман |agency=А. И. Леонов |edition=Русское искусство: очерки о жизни и творчестве художников. Середина XIX века.  |location=Москва |date=1958 |publisher=Искусство |pages = 275—286}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[Габрилович, Николай Евгеньевич|Nicholas Gabrilovich]] (1865-1941), the painting was commissioned by his father, Eugene Gabrilovich (1835-1918), who at that time studied in Munich. The canvas was acquired by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] before 1893. In 1923, the picture was exhibited at the Tretyakov Gallery at an exhibition dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the death of Pavel Tretyakov.
There is also an unfinished variant of the painting, which until the early 1970s was in possession of the widow of Nicholas Gabrilovich, Larisa Maslova-Gabrilovich (1894-1985), and then was sold to a private collection in Kemerovo.
In November 2015, the Engineering Building of the State Tretyakov Gallery organized an exhibition of the painting in conjunction with the conference "Art in homeopathy and homeopathy in art".&lt;ref name="homeopath"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The "positive extreme of the scene" is located in the right part of the painting. In the background, an allegorical depiction of Homeopathy soars in the clouds. In front of her is the god of medicine [[Aesculapius]] in a red cloak, his left hand raised in anger and indignation. Behind him is the goddess [[Athena]], who protects the sciences. At the right edge of the canvas is the German physician [[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755-1843), the founder of homeopathy. 
All of them look with disapproval and indignation at those associated with [[allopathy]] (modern medicine) in the "negative extreme," located on the left side of the painting, where doctors mistreat a patient. One doctor saws off the leg of a patient while the patient's wife and children sob in the lower left corner, the figure of Death waiting in the doorway.&lt;ref name="elshevskaya"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture reflects the status homeopathy had in the nineteenth century, when it claimed to be more scientific than the extremely dogmatic "[[heroic medicine]]" of the period, which frequently did more harm than good, whereas, in the words of [[Ben Goldacre]], homeopathy "at least did nothing either way."&lt;ref name="Goldacre: A kind of magic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben |title=A kind of magic?|author-link=Ben Goldacre|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the painting depicts conventional medicine as rogues and charlatans.

'''''L'architecte textile''''' is a 2017 French [[documentary]] [[feature film|feature]] film &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allocine.fr/societe/fichesociete-2519/ ''[[Saint-André-des-Arts (cinéma)|Saint-André-des-Arts]]''].&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Mika'ela Fisher]] about [[sartorial]] [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=253067.html Source : Allociné]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnc.fr/web/fr/rechercher-une-oeuvre/-/visa/145106 ''CNC''] visa d'exploitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An in-depth documentary on the [[architecture]] of [[bespoke tailoring]]. Over the course of hundreds of hours the mistress tailor filmed herself while making a three-piece suit. This film is an open window into this sartorial craft.

==Cast==
*[[Mika'ela Fisher]] herself: maître tailleur ([[Master tailor]])
*[[Renato Bianchi]] of the [[Comédie Française]] himself: maître d'essayage ([[Fitting master]])

==About the film==
Documenting the intimate in [[sartorial]] art:

A mistress tailor films herself in the creative production of a three-piece suit : 
sketch, pattern, fabric, shaping, assembly, fitting, finalization - hundreds of (wo)man-hours, a story, a film... and an allegory.

==Homage as essence==
===Art sartorial===

Art Sartorial is maybe a forgotten or unknown term, but corresponds to the [[art]] of the Master [[Tailor]]. And this film wants to show in detail the knowledge and practice thus of the technique of this art.

===Grand Couture===

A avant-garde documentary that was fallen right in the middle of the [[Fashion Week]], while the press attaches are boosting their crazy fashion designer on social networks and while the fashion bloggers and the hippest people in the world Planet rush at the foot of the catwalk.
L'architecte textile a perfect [[counterpoint]], the precise work of a watchmaker in the space of the textile architect, who with his skillful hands structures and builds the garment that will sublimate the body by drawing clean lines, and, for the beauty of the gesture, sneak by the tip of the needle the pleats flying away at the slightest movement ...

A masterpiece of precision micro mechanics ... the Art of the Grand [[Haute couture|Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://architecte-textile-fashionweekparis.blogspot.fr/ ''L'architecte textile Fashion Week'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:L'architecte textile A film by Mika'Ela Fisher.jpg|thumb|L'architecte textile A film by Mika'Ela Fisher]]

==Production==
The original idea was to realize a school film for fashion students &lt;ref&gt;[https://univ-psl.fr/agenda/projection-du-film-larchitecte-textile ''L'architecte textile Program Training''] [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs]]&lt;/ref&gt; so that traditional couture survives and we do not forget the technique of sartorial art, which is disappearing. The first provisional version of the film is 10 hours long. Finally, a 100-minute cinema film has been created to give "non-professionals" the opportunity to experience this exclusive and increasingly rare profession. The film has a very [[avant-garde]] structure because of the type of camera work, the [[sound design]] and the [[editing]] of the film, so the [[film genre]] is difficult to reclassify. A mix of documentary, [[experimental film]], [[feature film]], [[cultural film]] and [[educational film]].

A longer version of at least six hours is currently in [[post-production]], which will be presented in museums and galleries in 2020.

==Psychology of the film==
The film begins and ends with quotations from [[Albert Camus]] [[The Myth of Sisyphus]]

" The struggle itself to the heights is enough to fill the heart of a man. One must imagine Sisyphus happy ".

"  At the far end of this sustained effort measured by space without sky and depthless time, the goal is reached ".
(The Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus, Gallimard, 1942)

'''''La Gommeuse''''' {{IPA-fr|la ɡɔmøz|}} is a 1901 [[oil on canvas]] painting by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. It dates from his so-called [[Picasso's Blue Period | Blue period]] and is noted for its caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach painted on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Mark|title=Blue period Picasso – with a little secret – goes under the hammer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/09/picasso-la-gommeuse-blue-period-auction|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Anita|title=The US billionaire who got two Picassos for the price of one|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/11922971/The-US-billionaire-who-got-two-Picassos-for-the-price-of-one.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was offered for sale ''ex'' the [[Bill Koch (businessman) | William I.

''Gommeuse'' was sexually charged slang of the time for café-concert singers and their songs.&lt;ref name= "Sotheby's"/&gt;

== Background ==

The painting was executed in the second half of 1901 following Picasso's successful exhibition at the [[Vollard]] gallery that June. This was at the start of his [[Picasso's Blue Period | Blue period]] of 1901 to 1904, thought to have been occasioned by the suicide of his friend [[Carlos Casagemas]] earlier in the year, a time when his paintings were somewhat melancholic and characterized by somber monochromatic tones in blue and green.&lt;ref name= "Sotheby's"/&gt;

The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach on the reverse is inscribed "Recuerdo a Mañach en el día de su santo", demonstrating the painting was intended as a gift for Mañach on his Saint's Day (29 June). Mañach was a Catalan anarchist who shared Picasso's studio flat in the [[Boulevard de Clichy]]. He worked as a talent scout for art dealers and was responsible for organising Picasso's successful 1901 Vollard show. A portrait of Mañach, now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, was a feature of the show.&lt;ref name= "Sotheby's"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spleen et ideal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Spleen et idéal'', by [[Carlos Schwabe]], 1907]]
'''''Le Spleen de Paris''''', also known as '''''Paris Spleen''''' or '''''Petits Poèmes en prose''''', is a collection of 50 short [[prose poetry|prose poems]] by [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The collection was published posthumously in 1869 and is associated with [[literary modernism]].

Baudelaire mentions he had read [[Aloysius Bertrand]]'s ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit (book)|Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (considered the first example of prose poetry) at least twenty times before starting this work. Though inspired by Bertrand, Baudelaire's prose poems were based on Parisian contemporary life instead of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] background which Bertrand employed. He said of his work: "These are [[Les Fleurs du mal|the flowers of evil]] again, but with more freedom, much more detail, and much more mockery." Indeed, many of the themes and even titles from Baudelaire's earlier collection ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' are revisited in this work.

These poems have no particular order, have no beginning and no end and they can be read like thoughts or short stories in a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] style. The point of the poems is "to capture the beauty of life in the modern city," using what [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] has labeled as being his [[Existentialism|existential]] outlook on his surroundings.

Published twenty years after the fratricidal [[June Days uprising|June Days]] that ended the ideal or "brotherly" [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]], Baudelaire makes no attempts at trying to reform society he has grown up in but realizes the inequities of the progressing modernization of Paris. In poems such as "The Eyes of the Poor" where he writes (after witnessing an impoverished family looking in on a new cafe): "Not only was I moved by that family of eyes, but I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and decanters, larger than our thirst...", showing his feelings of despair and class guilt.

The title of the work refers not to the abdominal organ (the [[spleen]]) but rather to the second, more literary meaning of the word, "melancholy with no apparent cause, characterised by a disgust with everything".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from ''Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major themes in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' ==

=== Pleasure ===
''Le Spleen de Paris'' explores the idea of pleasure as a vehicle for expressing emotion. Many of the poems refer to sex or sin explicitly (i.e. "Double Bedroom," "A Hemisphere in a Head of Hair", "Temptations"); others use subtle language and imagery to evoke sensuality (i.e. "the Artist's Confiteor"). In both cases, the diction is undeniably sexual; for example, in "Double Bedroom", "Muslin rains abundantly over the windows and around the bed in a snowy cascade. Within this bed is ensconced the Idol, queen of dreams."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=9}} Baudelaire's obsession with pleasure reflects his love for scandal and wickedness, as well as his philosophy that by seeking pleasure, man taps into his authentic "evil" self.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Joanna. Baudelaire. St. Martin's Press: New York, 1994. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sobriety and intoxication ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems openly advocate drinking and intoxication, such as "Be Drunk". Intoxication (or any equal pleasure such as creative work, sex, virtue, etc.) creates a euphoria and timelessness that allows you to transcend the limitations of time and truly live "in the moment". In "Be Drunk", the speaker commands the reader to engage in something intoxicating: "You must be drunk always... Time crushes your shoulders and bends you earthward, you must be drunk without respite."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=71}} Sobriety, in contrast, forces you to address the harsh realities of the world around you. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by some critics, who claim that Baudelaire was actually being ironic in his advocacy for drunkenness. Maria Scott, a literary scholar, claims that Baudelaire believed "artificial toxication was ... far inferior to 'successive work' and the 'regular exercise of will', that artificial stimulants ... actually ''amplify'' time."{{sfn|Scott|2005|pp=196–197}} Thus, it is debatable whether intoxication refers to literal drunkenness as an escape or if symbolizes the pleasure found in writing and expressing oneself.

=== The artist/poet ===
In ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the concept of artist and poet intermingle. Baudelaire saw poetry as a form of art, and thus in many of the prose poems the artist is a substitute for a traditional poet or speaker. In "The Desire to Paint", the artist attempts to depict his beautiful muse with images, just as the poet attempts to express his emotions with language. The relationship between the artist and poet reflects the need to evoke a particular feeling or idea, and this thread is carried through almost every single poem in the text. Ultimately, the artist and the poet become one, since they share the same purpose – to describe beauty. In this sense, the work itself (and every individual poem within) is beautiful, a "work of art" due to its innovative, interesting form. Thus, the poem, according to Baudelaire, is as much an "aesthetic experience" as it is a literary one.&lt;ref&gt;Hiddleston, J. A. ''Baudelaire and Le Spleen de Paris''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Women are both admired and ridiculed in ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Some poems, such as "The Desire to Paint", reflect female power and sexuality in a somewhat positive manner. However, a larger portion of the poems in Baudelaire's work debase women as evil, gaudy, and cold. Many are represented as prostitutes, and according to scholars, "the courtesan would seem to be a virtual incarnation, for Baudelaire, of all that is artificial and misleading."{{sfn|Scott|2005|p=54}} In "The Rope", the speaker's apprentice hangs himself, and his mother comes to collect the rope. The speaker is shocked to discover that she did so not to "preserve them as horrible and precious relics", but to sell them for a morbid profit.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|pp=62–64}} Baudelaire rejects the concept of maternal love and replaces it with a cold economic reality. Still, women are inherently sexual, and in some regards, Baudelaire admires their sensual beauty (connects back to themes of intoxication, pleasure).

=== Mortality and the passage of time ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems are dominated by the concept of time, usually negatively. The speaker in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' fears the passage of time and his/her own mortality. As a result, intoxication, women, pleasure, and writing are all forms of escape from this unavoidable hell. "Be Drunk" and "Already!" exemplify Baudelaire's infatuation with the idea of time. In "Already!" the speaker is incapable of matching the infiniteness and simplicity of nature, and at the end, comes face to face with his own death: "I felt pulled down deathwards; which is why, when companions said, 'At last!' I could only cry, '''Already!''"{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=73}} Also, this theme supports Baudelaire's admiration of art and poetry because although man cannot defeat time and death, a work of art can. Art, poetry, life, and death are inextricably linked within Baudelaire's poems, and perhaps reflect a personal obsession with mortality.

===The city===
For Baudelaire, the setting of most poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is the Parisian metropolis, specifically the poorer areas within the city. Notable poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' whose urban setting is important include “Crowds” and “The Old Mountebank.” Within his writing about city life, Baudelaire seems to stress the relationship between individual and society, frequently placing the speaker in a reflective role looking out at the city. It is also important to note that Baudelaire's Paris is not one of nice shops and beautiful streets. Instead, Baudelaire focuses on dirty, poverty-stricken areas of Paris with social problems rather than the Paris of the upper class.

===Poverty/class===
In connection with the theme of the Parisian metropolis, Baudelaire focuses heavily on the theme of poverty and social class within ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Important poems from the collection which embody these themes include "The Toy of the Poor", "The Eyes of the Poor", "Counterfeit Money", and "Let's Beat Up the Poor". In these poems Baudelaire introduces slightly differing views of the urban poor. In "The Toy of the Poor" Baudelaire heavily stresses the need for equality between social classes in Paris. In comparison, "Counterfeit Money" and "Let's Beat Up the Poor" seem to use a sarcastic tone to instil empathy in the reader for those people in poverty. In [[Michael Hamburger]]'s introduction to his translation, ''Twenty Prose Poems of Baudelaire'', the scholar notes a highly sympathetic view of the poor in ''Le Spleen de Paris''; Baudelaire seems to relate to the poor and becomes an advocate for them in his poetry.{{sfn|Hamburger|1946|pp=vii–xii}}

===Religion/good vs. evil===
Many poems in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' incorporate a central theme of religion or the relationship between good and evil in human nature. "Cake", which centers on a moral battle addressing the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil stands out as an especially important poem within the collection. "Loss of a Halo" also incorporates similar themes, literally discussing the role of angels as well as the relationship between mankind and religious ideology, questioning the goodness of Christian ideals. Along these lines, Baudelaire repeatedly addresses the theme of sin within his poetry as well as questioning how the hierarchy of class could affect the hierarchy of goodness, implying that those of higher social class tend not to be morally superior to those of lower classes. Many critics of Baudelaire address the prominent role of religion in the poet's life and how that might have affected his writing. Some suspect that since Baudelaire internalized Christian practices, he thought himself capable of accurately portraying God in his writing. Yet by representing God's message within his poetry, Baudelaire placed himself in a position of patriarchal authority, similar to that of the God depicted in Christianity.

==Poet/reader relationship==
The following passage is taken from the preface to the 2008 Mackenzie translation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', entitled "To Arsène Houssaye":

{{quote|My dear friend, I send you here a little work of which no one could say that it has neither head nor tail, because, on the contrary, everything in it is both head and tail, alternately and reciprocally. Please consider what fine advantages this combination offers to all of us, to you, to me, and to the reader. We can cut whatever we like—me, my reverie, you, the manuscript, and the reader, his reading; for I don't tie the impatient reader up in the endless thread of a superfluous plot. Pull out one of the vertebrae, and the two halves of this tortuous fantasy will rejoin themselves painlessly. Chop it up into numerous fragments, and you'll find that each one can live on its own. In the hopes that some of these stumps will be lively enough to please and amuse you, I dedicate the entire serpent to you.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=3}}}}

While writing ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire made very conscious decisions regarding his relationship with his readers. As seen in the preface to the collection, addressed to his publisher, Arsène Houssaye, Baudelaire attempted to write a text that was very accessible to a reader while pulling the most appealing aspects of both prose and poetry and combining them into the revolutionary genre of prose poetry. For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, "The Dog and the Vial" as well as other poems throughout ''Le Spleen de Paris'' seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In "The Dog and the Vial", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes with the frustration of the speaker with his dog, expressed as the speaker states: "In this respect you, unworthy companion of my sad life, resemble the public, to whom one must never present the delicate scents that only exasperate them, but instead give them only dung, chosen with care".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=14}} One can extrapolate this poem to apply more figuratively to the larger themes of the poet-reader relationship, in which Baudelaire deprecates his readers, viewing them as unintelligent and incapable of appreciating his work.

== Style ==
''Le Spleen de Paris'' represents a definitive break from traditional poetic forms. The text is composed of "prose poems" which span the continuum between "prosaic" and "poetic" works. The new, unconventional form of poetry was characteristic of the modernist movement occurring throughout Europe (and particularly in Paris) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marshall. "Baudelaire: Modernism in the Streets." ''All that is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Penguin Group Inc., 1988. 148. Google Books. 2009. 21 May 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mox1ywiyhtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire describes that modernity requires a new language, "a miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and striking enough to suit lyrical movements of the soul, undulations of reverie, the flip-flops of consciousness", and in this sense, ''Le Spleen de Paris'' gives life to modern language.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=3}} Baudelaire's prose poetry tends to be more poetic in comparison to later works such as Ponge's [[Le parti pris des choses]], but each poem varies. For an example of a more poetic poem, see "Evening Twilight"; for a prosaic example, see "The Bad Glazier".

== Publication history, influences, and critical reception ==
Baudelaire's ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is unique in that it was published posthumously by his sister in 1869, two years after Baudelaire died. In fact, it was not until his waning years, plagued by physical ailments and the contraction of syphilis that he created a table of contents for the book. Baudelaire spent years 1857 to 1867 working on his book of poems that chronicled daily life in the city of Paris. These poems aimed at capturing the times in which they were written, from the brutally repressed upheavals of 1848 (after which the government censored literature more than ever), the 1851 ''coup d'état'' of Louis Bonaparte and generally Paris of the 1850s, demolished and renovated by Napoleon III's prefect, Baron Haussman. In displaying the social antagonisms of the age, Baudelaire drew influence from many great artists of the time. In fact, an active critical essayist himself, his critical reviews of other poets "elucidate the recesses of the mind that created ''Les Fleurs du Mal'' and ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

'''Influence:''' While there is much speculation regarding direct influence and inspiration in the creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the following colleagues seem to have clearly influenced the book of small poems:

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]: "Indeed, Poe illustrates his claim with several examples which seem to summarize with uncanny precision the temperament of Baudelaire himself (Poe 273–4).{{Incomplete short citation|date=August 2018}} The affinity between the two writers in this regard seems beyond dispute ... Moreover, 'Le Démon de la perversité' is less a tale than a prose poem, and both its subject-matter and its movement from general considerations to specific examples leading to an unexpected conclusion may have influenced Baudelaire in his creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

Aloysius Betrand's ''Gaspard de la nuit'': Baudelaire himself is quoted as citing this work as an inspiration for ''Paris Spleen''.

Gustave Flaubert: Magazine article "No ideas but in Crowds: Baudelaire's ''Paris Spleen''" cites similarities between the writers in that like Baudelaire, Flaubert held the same motives and intentions in that he too wanted "to write the moral history of the men of my generation – or, more accurately, the history of their feelings."

'''Critical reception:''' The way in which the poem was received certainly lends to understanding the climate in which Baudelaire created ''Le Spleen de Paris'', in that "It appears to be almost a diary entry, an explicit rundown of the day's events; those events seem to be precisely the kind that Charles Baudelaire would have experienced in the hectic and hypocritical world of the literary marketplace of his day."

Notable critical reception: In order to truly understand how ''Le Spleen de Paris'' was received, one must first be acquainted with Baudelaire's earlier works. The repressions and upheavals of 1848 resulted in massive censorship of literature, which did not bode well for Baudelaire's perhaps most famous work, ''Les Fleurs du Mal''. Society was so shocked by the satanic references and sexual perversion in the book that at the time it was a critical and popular failure. This put the anticipated reception of ''Le Spleen de Paris'' at a disadvantage. Like ''Flowers of Evil'', it wasn't until much later that ''Paris Spleen'' was fully appreciated for what it was, a masterpiece that "brought the style of the prose poem to the broader republics of the people". That being said, just four years after Arthur Rimbaud used Baudelaire's work as a foundation for his poems, as he considered Baudelaire a great poet and pioneer of prose.

'''Appearance in Media:''' A 2006 film ''Spleen'', written by Eric Bomba-Ire, borrowed its title from Baudelaire's book of prose poems. Baudelaire expressed a particular feeling that he called 'Spleen' which is a mixture of melancholy, rage, eros, and resignation, which ties in well with the movie's darkly woven tale of love, betrayal and passion.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0816659|Spleen|(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable quotations==
{{importance section|date=April 2013}}
In "Let us beat up the poor", Baudelaire makes up a parable about economic and social equality: no one is entitled to it; it belongs to those who can win it and keep it. And he taunts the social reformer: "What do you think of that, Proudhon?"{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=36}}

"At One in the Morning" is like a diary entry, a rundown of the day's events. In it, Baudelaire recognizes that he is part of a society full of hypocrites. His individual self becomes "blurred...by a hypocrisy and perverseness which progressively undermine the difference between the self and others." This is at least partly what Baudelaire meant by "a modern and more abstract life."{{sfn|Hill|2006}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

"The Thyrsus" is a piece addressed to composer [[Franz Liszt]]. The ancient Greek thyrsus had connotations of "unleashed sexuality and violence, of the profound power of the irrational." Baudelaire believed the thyrsus to be an acceptable object of representation for Liszt's music.

In "The Bad Windowpane Maker" Baudelaire speaks of a "kind of energy that springs from ennui and reverie" that manifests itself in a particularly unexpected way in the most inactive dreamers. Doctors and moralists alike are at a loss to explain where such mad energy so suddenly comes from to these lazy people, why they suddenly feel the need to perform such absurd and dangerous deeds.{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=56}}

The prefatory letter Baudelaire wrote to Arsene Houssaye, the editor of ''La Presse'', was not necessarily intended to be included in the publication. When Baudelaire drew up his table of contents for the projected book form, he did not include the letter. It is possible, then, that the letter only appeared in ''La Presse'' as a means of flattery to ensure that Houssaye would publish the poems.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=xiii}} Nevertheless, it allows us to understand Baudelaire's thinking about the genre of prose poetry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Who among us has not dreamed, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and jarring enough to be adapted to the soul's lyrical movements, the undulations of reverie, to the twists and turns that consciousness takes?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society.

==John Dalton bust ==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 15 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|John Dalton bust – Burlington House]]
The bronze bust of [[John Dalton]], located along the corridor on the first floor, was also created by Ruby Levick and was donated to the [[Chemical Society]] in 1903 by its former President Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe,&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt; as also attested by the inscription engraved on the bust's base: "John Dalton presented by T.E.

{{quote|The portrait of the Honourable Robert Boyle, in the Library of the Institute, is attributed to [[Jonathan Richardson]], who left many portraits unsigned; this has been pronounced by several authorities as undoubtedly his work. The portrait bears the dates of Boyle’s birth and death (1626–1691) and was probably a posthumous portrait. Richardson was born in 1665; however, names and dates were often added to portraits long after they had been painted. The portrait resembles the engraving of a bust by Faber and bears a close likeness to Boyle’s sister, the Countess of Ranelagh, at whose house in London he lived and worked for many years. It has been objected that few of the nobility and gentlemen of the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]] were painted otherwise than in court dress. Portraits showing gentlemen in dressing gowns and velvet caps appeared more frequently about 1720, when Boyle had been dead nearly 30 years; but it may be suggested that Richardson preferred to represent him as a philosopher in his study. Towards the end of his life, Boyle lived very quietly in the country and did not frequent the court. The picture was purchased at a sale at [[Loudoun Castle]], Galston, Ayrshire, and acquired for the Institute, by private subscription, in 1931.}}

The ''Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland'' said of this painting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the Council|journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1918|volume=42|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The portrait of Prof. Meldola, referred to in the Report of the Council, was unveiled by Sir [[James Johnston Dobbie|James Dobbie]], President of the Institute, at a Special Meeting of the Council held on December 15th, 1917. Mrs. Meldola, Lady Dobbk, Prof. and Mrs. Poulton, and a number of friends and past students of Prof. Meldola were also present. The President said that Sir George Keilby had on the same afternoon unveiled another portrait of Prof. Meldola, by the same artist (Solomon J. Solomon), at the Royal Society. He referred to the late Professor’s interest in science generally as well as in that which he had chosen as his profession. It was fitting that such a memorial should find a place in the Council Room, especially in view of the valuable services rendered to the Institute by Prof. Meldola in connection with the new building during the last few years of his life. After alluding to the extraordinary range and varied character of Prof. Meldola’s activities in teaching, in research and in public affairs, he paid a tribute to his personal qualities as a man, remarking on his strong character and influence, his appreciation of humour, his fine literary gift and powers of conversation. Having unveiled the portrait the President warmly praised the work. All would agree that the artist had achieved a remarkable success. He also expressed the hearty thanks of the Institute to those who had subscribed to the presentation, and to Prof. Poulton for having been the means whereby the Institute had become possessed of such a valuable memorial to its past President. Prof. Poulton having replied, Mr. Gordon Salamon, Hon. Treasurer, also spoke in appreciation of the gift, and the President’s remarks were warmly endorsed by Mr. A. J. Chapman, a former student of Prof. Meldola.}}

Member of the Royal Academy, [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]] was a British artist who produced works of different style and different subjects, being very productive as innovative portraitist.&lt;ref name="Portrait Painters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solomon Joseph Solomon RA PRBA (1860–1927)|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel//paint/solomons.htm|website=Myweb.Tiscali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the Council Room, this painting shows [[Michael Faraday]] giving one of a course of six [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]] at the [[Royal Institution]]. Focused on the distinctive properties of common metals, these lectures were delivered between 27 December 1855 and 8 January 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faraday's Christmas lecture before Prince Albert|url=http://www.rigb.org/whats-on/events-2013/december/fact--faraday-lecture-to-princes|website=The Royal Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the Prince Consort ([[Queen Victoria]]'s husband), and the Prince of Wales (later King [[Edward VII]]) are in the front row.

The plate on the frame gives the artist's name, [[Alexander Blaikley]] (1816–1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Blaikley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/artists/alexander-blaikley|website=BBC.

'''''M.D.''''' was a short lived [[comic book]] published by [[EC Comics]] in 1955, the sixth title in its ''New Direction'' line. The bi-monthly comic was published by [[Bill Gaines]] and edited  by [[Al Feldstein]]. It lasted a total of five issues before being cancelled along with EC's other ''New Direction'' comics.

==Content==
''M.D.'' focused on medical stories, surgical practices and the day-to-day work of doctors. Each issue featured four stories, plus at least one text piece about a real-life major medical figure.

The frontispiece to the first issue set out its role:
{{cquote|This magazine, ''M.D.'', is the sixth of E.C.'s "New Direction" publications. It is dedicated to Mankind's tireless and unceasing battle against disease and to the man who fights that never-ending battle day after day after day... your Family Doctor... your M.D.

But although the M.D. is the protagonist in this magazine, he is not necessarily the hero! The ''real'' hero is the man, woman, or child who enters into the M.D.'s stirring and grim world of real medicine to seek out the help and relief his wisdom and experience can give.

This, then, is the theme of ''M.D.'' It will contain stories of ''people''... people who are helped by their Family Doctor and his associates in the Medical Profession. It will deal frankly and honestly with the diseases and misfortunes that beset people. It will deal graphically and candidly with the treatment they receive. At times, its stories will be poignant... at time they will be sad... at times they will be grim. But at all times, they will be ''true to life!''

And now, because we feel it best epitomizes the ideals of the Medical Profession, we, the editors of ''M.D.'' offer the view taken by all M.D.'s... "The Hippocratic Oath":}}
...the [[Hippocratic Oath]] was then reprinted in full.

The [[letters page]] (upon the first of which the above text appeared in lieu of early letters) was titled "The Needles", and contributors to ''M.D.'' include [[Graham Ingels]], [[Marie Severin]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Reed Crandall]] and [[Carl Wessler]].

==Reprints==
''M.D.'' was reprinted as part of publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#The Complete EC Library|Complete EC Library]]'' collection, alongside ''[[Valor (EC Comics)|Valor]]'' and ''[[Impact (EC Comics)|Impact]]'' as Volume 2 of the "New Direction Part 2" slipcased set (1985). Between September 1999 and January 2000, Cochran and [[Gemstone Publishing]] reprinted the five individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a single softcover ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#EC Annuals|EC Annual]]''.

'''''Medea''''' ({{lang-grc|Μήδεια}}, ''Mēdeia'') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Euripides]], based upon the myth of [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] and first produced in 431 BC. The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the "[[barbarian]]" kingdom of [[Colchis]], and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves her for a Greek princess of [[Corinth]]. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering Jason's new wife as well as her own children, after which she escapes to [[Athens]] to start a new life.

''Medea'' and the suite of plays that it accompanied in the [[City Dionysia]] was not well received at its original performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp |Gregory |2005 |p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=July 2018}} The play was re-discovered in [[Augustan drama]], and again in 16th-century Europe, from which time it remained part of the tragedic repertoire, and became a classic of the [[Western canon]] and has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century. It experienced renewed interest in the [[feminist movement]] of the late 20th century,&lt;ref name=feminist/&gt; being interpreted as a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Medea's struggle to take charge of her own life in a male-dominated world.&lt;ref&gt;Helene P. Foley. Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage. University of California Press, Sep 1, 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The play holds the American Tony award record for most wins for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play#Multiple character wins|same female lead character]], with [[Judith Anderson]] winning in 1948, [[Zoe Caldwell]] in 1982, and [[Diana Rigg]] in 1994.

==History==

''Medea'' was first performed in 431 BC at the [[City Dionysia]] festival. Here every year three playwrights competed against each other, each writing a [[tetralogy]] of three tragedies and a satyr play (alongside ''Medea'' were ''[[Philoctetes (Euripides)|Philoctetes]]'', ''[[Dictys]]'' and the [[satyr play]] ''[[Theristai]]''). In 431 the competition was among [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] (the son of famed playwright [[Aeschylus]]), [[Sophocles]] (Euripides' main rival) and Euripides. Euphorion won, and Euripides placed last.

While ''Medea'' is considered one of the great plays of the [[Western canon]], the Athenian audience did not react so favorably, and it placed third out of the three competing plays at the [[Dionysia]] festival of 431 BC. A possible explanation is found in a [[scholium]] to line 264 of the play, which asserts that Medea's children were traditionally killed by the Corinthians after her escape;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp |Ewans |2007 |p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euripides' apparent invention of Medea's [[filicide]] might have offended its audience just as his [[Hippolytus (play)|first treatment of the Hippolytus myth]] did.&lt;ref&gt;This theory of Euripides' invention has gained wide acceptance. See (e.g.) {{harvp |McDermott |1989 |p=12}}; {{harvp |Powell |1990 |p=35}}; {{harvp |Sommerstein |2002 |p=16}}; {{harvp |Griffiths |2006 |p=81}}; {{harvp |Ewans |2007 |p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That Euripides and others took liberties with Medea's story may be inferred from the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus Siculus]]: "Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvellous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out."&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 4.56&lt;/ref&gt; A common urban legend claimed that Euripides put the blame on Medea because the Corinthians have bribed him with a sum of five talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2017/03/26/korinthian-women-and-the-plot-against-medea/|title=Korinthian Women and the Plot Against Medea|date=26 March 2017|website=Sententiaeantiquae.com|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century BC, South-Italian vase painting offers a number of Medea-representations that are connected to Euripides' play&amp;nbsp;— the most famous is a [[krater]] in Munich. However, these representations always differ considerably from the plots of the play or are too general to support any direct link to the play of Euripides&amp;nbsp;– this might reflect the judgement on the play. However, the violent and powerful character of princess Medea, and her double nature&amp;nbsp;— both loving and destructive&amp;nbsp;— became a standard for the later periods of antiquity and seems to have inspired numerous adaptations.

With the rediscovery of the text in [[Augustan drama|1st-century Rome]] (the play was adapted by the tragedians [[Ennius]], [[Lucius Accius]], [[Ovid]], [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Hosidius Geta]], among others), again in 16th-century Europe.

In  20th-century modern [[literary criticism]], ''Medea'' and its "universal themes of [[revenge]] and [[justice]] in an unjust society" have provoked differing reactions from differing critics and writers.{{huh|date=July 2018}}

==Form and themes==

The form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity: All scenes involve only two actors, Medea and someone else. The Chorus (A staple in Greek theater) would also usually be involved along with those two, representing the women of Corinth. These encounters serve to highlight Medea's skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures to achieve her own ends. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only one about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood as opposed to in a state of temporary madness.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Edith. 1997. "Introduction" in ''Medea: Hippolytus ; Electra ; Helen'' Oxford University Press. pp. ix–xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euripides' characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, [[love]], and [[Revenge|vengeance]]. 
The character of Medea has variously been interpreted as either fulfilling her role of "mother and wife" and as acting as a "proto-feminist".&lt;ref name="Macintosh"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macintosh |first1=Fiona |editor1=Brown, Sarah Annes |editor2=Silverstone, Catherine |title=Tragedy in Transition |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Mass. |isbn=978-1-40-513546-7 |page=193 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tragedy_in_Transition.html?id=4CMq2Cirr4AC&amp;q=proto-feminist |chapter=Oedipus and Medea on the Modern Stage |quote=[Medea] has successfully negotiated her path through very diverse cultural and political contexts: either by being radically recast as 'exemplary' mother and wife, or by being seen as proto-feminist wrongly abandoned by a treacherous husband.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Feminist readings have interpreted the play as either a "sympathetic exploration" of the "disadvantages of being a woman in a [[patriarchal]] society",&lt;ref name=feminist&gt;See (e.g.) {{harvp |Rabinowitz |1993 |pp=125–54}}; {{harvp |McDonald |1997 |p=307}}; {{harvp |Mastronarde |2002 |pp=26–8}}; {{harvp |Griffiths |2006 |pp=74–5}}; {{harvp |Mitchell-Boyask |2008 |p=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an expression of misogynist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Margaret |editor-last=Powell |editor-first=Anton |title=Euripides, Women, and Sexuality |edition=1st |date=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London, UK |isbn=0-415-01025-X |pages=16–31 |chapter=A Woman's Place in Euripides' Medea}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea's [[barbarian]] identity, which would antagonize{{quote needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--the audience was Athenian, not generically Greek, and we would need a specific quote better than "passim" for the claim that classical Athens would be "antagonized" by the depiction of "barbarians" in a play.--&gt; a 5th-century Greek audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp |DuBois |1991 |pp=115–24}}; {{harvp |Hall |1991 |loc=''passim''}}; {{harvp |Saïd |2002 |pp=62–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

''Medea'' is centered on a wife’s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. The play is set in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] some time after Jason's quest for the [[Golden Fleece]], where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea in a blind rage towards Jason for arranging to marry [[Glauce]], the daughter of [[Creon (king of Corinth)]]. The nurse, overhearing Medea’s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.

Creon, in anticipation of Medea’s wrath, arrives and reveals his plans to send her into exile. Medea pleads for one day’s delay and eventually Creon acquiesces. In the next scene Jason arrives to explain his rationale for his apparent betrayal. He explains that he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to marry a royal princess, as Medea is only a barbarian woman, but hopes to someday join the two families and keep Medea as his mistress. Medea, and the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of Corinthian women, do not believe him. She reminds him that she left her own people for him (''"I am the mother of your children. Whither can I fly, since all Greece hates the barbarian?"''), and that she saved him and slew the dragon. Jason promises to support her after his new marriage, but Medea spurns him: ''"Marry the maid if thou wilt; perchance full soon thou mayst rue thy nuptials."''

In the following scene Medea encounters [[Aegeus]], [[King of Athens]]. He reveals to her that despite his marriage he is still without children. He visited the [[oracle]] who merely told him that he was instructed “not to unstop the wineskin’s neck.” Medea relays her current situation to him and begs for Aegeus to let her stay in [[Athens]] if she gives him drugs to end his infertility. Aegeus, unaware of Medea’s plans for revenge, agrees.

Medea then returns to plotting the murders of Glauce and Creon. She decides to poison some golden robes (a family heirloom and gift from the sun god [[Helios]]) and a coronet, in hopes that the bride will not be able to resist wearing them, and consequently be poisoned. Medea resolves to kill her own children as well, not because the children have done anything wrong, but because she feels it is the best way to hurt Jason. She calls for Jason once more and, in an elaborate ruse, apologizes to him for overreacting to his decision to marry Glauce. When Jason appears fully convinced that she regrets her actions, Medea begins to cry in mourning of her exile. She convinces Jason to allow her to give the robes to Glauce in hopes that Glauce might get Creon to lift the exile. Eventually Jason agrees and allows their children to deliver the poisoned robes as the gift-bearers.

{{quote|Forgive what I said in anger! I will yield to the decree, and only beg one favor, that my children may stay. They shall take to the princess a costly robe and a golden crown, and pray for her protection.}}

[[File:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Medea kills her son, [[Campania]]n red-figure [[amphora]], c. 330 BC, [[Louvre]] (K 300).]]

In the next scene a messenger recounts Glauce and Creon’s deaths. When the children arrived with the robes and coronet, Glauce gleefully put them on and went to find her father. Soon the poisons overtook Glauce and she fell to the floor, dying horribly and painfully. Creon clutched her tightly as he tried to save her and, by coming in contact with the robes and coronet, got poisoned and died as well.

{{quote|Alas! The bride had died in horrible agony; for no sooner had she put on Medea's gifts than a devouring poison consumed her limbs as with fire, and in his endeavor to save his daughter the old father died too.}}

While Medea is pleased with her current success she decides to take it one step forward. Since Jason brought shame upon her for trying to start a new family, Medea resolves to destroy the family he was willing to give up by killing their sons. Medea does have a moment of hesitation when she considers the pain that her children’s deaths will put her through. However, she steels her resolve to cause Jason the most pain possible and rushes offstage with a knife to kill her children. As the chorus laments her decision, the children are heard screaming. Jason then rushes onto the scene to confront Medea about murdering Creon and Glauce and he quickly discovers that his children have been killed as well. Medea then appears above the stage with the bodies of her children in the chariot of the sun god [[Helios]]. When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the ''[[mechane]]'' device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again:

{{quote|I do not leave my children's bodies with thee; I take them with me that I may bury them in [[Hera]]'s precinct. And for thee, who didst me all that evil, I prophesy an evil doom.}}

She escapes to Athens with the bodies. The chorus is left contemplating the will of [[Zeus]] in Medea's actions:

{{quote|Manifold are thy shapings, [[Divine Providence|Providence]]! / Many a hopeless matter gods arrange / What we expected never came to pass / What we did not expect the gods brought to bear / So have things gone, this whole experience through!}}

[[File:Joaquim Vayreda - The Beginning of Spring - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The Beginning of Spring, by Joaquim Vayreda]]
The '''Olot school''' of landscape painting is a group of painters that created an artistic style in the second half of the 19th century. It includes not simply artists from [[Olot]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]), but all artists whose artworks were inspired by the countryside of Olot.  By extension, artists connected with Olot and its [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]], [[Garrotxa]].

== History ==
In Catalonia, the proliferation of painting coincided with the [[Spain under the Restoration|Restoration]], a period marked by economic prosperity that favored the [[bourgeoisie]] which was the motor of the cultural renaissance of [[Catalan nationalism]]. This bourgeoisie had considerable influence in the arts; it sought art that was realistic, but simultaneously pleasing, elegant, and optimistic, and preferred painting over other artistic disciplines. During this period, several schools of art began and were consolidated, among them the Olot school.

The Olot school of landscape painting is similar to the [[Barbizon school]]. It was formed by [[Joaquim Vayreda|Joaquim]] and [[Marian Vayreda i Vila|Marian Vayreda]] with the assistance of [[Ramón Martí Alsina]]. From this tradition emerged a new artistic concept: creating multiple versions of the Olot countryside, where the treatment of light and chromatic variations were important elements. The Olot school used the countryside of Garrotxa as a source of inspiration for their work, but with stylistic freedom. Vayreda's paintings attracted the attention of artists including [[Laureano Barrau|Laureà Barrau]], [[Enric Galwey]], [[Joan Brull]], [[Lluís Masriera i Rosés|Lluís Masriera]], [[Modest Urgell]], [[Ramon Casas]], and [[Santiago Rusiñol]], who went to Olot and also painted depictions of the countryside.
[[File:BergaiBoix s-t(cel rogent) 1908.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Red Sky, by Josep Berga i Boix]]
The Olot school was supported by the founding of the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) in 1783 by bishop [[Tomás de Lorenzana]], and also by the creation of workshops dedicated to the reproduction of religious images. The first workshop that was dedicated to this work, "El Arte Cristiano", was founded in 1880. The industry of religious image making expanded considerably starting around 1900 in Olot, and became an important part of the city's economy. Today, the old Arte Cristiano factory has been converted into the Museum of the Saints (Museo de los Santos).

The Olot school was institutionalized by painter [[Josep Berga i Boix]], who served as director of the Olot Artistic and Cultural Center (Centre Artístic-Cultural d'Olot) (founded by Vayreda) in 1869 and later as director of the Public School of Drawing (Escola Pública de Dibuix) from 1877-1914. Annual exhibitions were organized first by the Artistic and Cultural Center and then by other entities.

Numerous other artists later continued the traditions of the Olot school, often training at the Public School of Drawing (called the Escola de Belles Arts i Oficis starting in 1939) under the direction of [[Ivó Pascual]], [[Martí Casadevall]], [[Bartomeu Mas y Collellmir]], and [[Joan Vilà i Moncau]]. Other artists belonging to the movement include [[Josep Berga i Boada]], [[Josep Clarà]], [[Melcior Domenge]], and [[Josep Pinós]].

== The Olot school today ==
The Drawing Festival (Fira del Dibuix) is celebrated annually in Olot on the Day of Sant Lluc. This festival brings together many artists that sell their works directly to the public. The festival was conceived particularly for the sale of works on paper, such as sketches, but recently it has been possible to find artworks in many media.

Since the 2003-2004 academic year, the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) has been called the [[Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot|Superior School of Art and Design]] (Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny), adding a degree in interior design; a graphic design degree was added in 2007-2008. Today, there are more than 400 students enrolled, particularly from the neighboring comarcas.

Today, the term "Olot school"--or particularly the term "Olot school of landscape painting" ("escuela paisajística de Olot" or "escola paisatgística d'Olot")--is not well-accepted, because not all artists connected with Olot paint landscapes, and not all the artists connected with the school work or live in the city of Olot.

'''Online book rental''' refers to a service wherein users rent books via the internet. Users browse books online and have their choices home-delivered, rather than physically visiting a [[library]] to borrow a book. This [[e-commerce]] model is very similar to the popular [[video rental]] service provided by the California-based [[Netflix]]. Online book rental is gaining popularity in India, with a number of websites offering free doorstep delivery for a small monthly fee. The popularity of such websites can be attributed to increasing internet usage in the country; India is expected to have the third-largest number of internet users in the world by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/biz/india-business/India-to-have-3rd-largest-number-of-Internet-users-by-2013/articleshow/4821630.cms India to have 3rd largest number of Internet users by 2013 – The Times of India]. Timesofindia.indiatimes.com (2009-07-26). Retrieved on 2012-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics for the publishing industry are also promising. India is the world's third-largest market for English books,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/22/books-india-china Publishers look to China and India to help them weather recession | Books]. The Guardian (2009-04-22). Retrieved on 2012-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and its entire book market—in English, as well as regional languages—is estimated to generate Rs. 10,000 [[crore]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/lr/2009/01/04/stories/2009010450040100.htm Literary Review : New horizons, new challenges]. The Hindu (2009-01-04). Retrieved on 2012-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The online book market in India is expected to grow at 30–35% annually for the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818173810/http://www.alootechie.com/content/indian-online-book-market-pegged-rs-59-crore-expected-grow-35-a-year Indian online book market pegged at Rs 59 crore; expected to grow by 35% a year]. alootechie.com (2009-11-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|The rental system}}Rental system ==

Online book-rental services save time by delivering books to a member's home or office. In addition to convenience, the service also offers an ease-of-use benefit; membership on most websites involves a simple [[registration form]] and payment through [[bank transfer]] or [[Collect on delivery|cash on delivery]]. This is important in a market that does not yet trust internet-based monetary transactions. Once membership is paid the user logs in to browse books, and clicks the "rent" button to receive the chosen books at home. The books are collected when the user logs in to indicate that he or she has finished reading.&lt;!-- How are the books collected? --&gt; Another advantage of online rental services is that most do not have any due dates or late fees; borrowers may keep books for as long as they wish, provided they pay the regular [[subscription]].
This era is changing, edits being made with education book selling. Engineering books are often taken on rent for a semester or 2 and returned after use. With the online space roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting. In engineering book stores, you order books and pay Cash on Delivery, after usage you collect back up to 70% of the invoice back. 

== Presence ==

Online libraries and rental companies have come  with a national presence and are trying to reach other smaller cities by using courier companies and the postal service to deliver books. These new ventures have become popular with the trend towards internet-based [[marketing]]; almost all have their own [[blog]]s and [[Facebook]] pages. Ventures like Pustakkosh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pustakkosh.com|title=Pustak Kosh - India's Leading TextBook and Student Need Rental Company|last=https://www.pustakkosh.com|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Justbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetechpanda.com/2013/06/10/justbooks-clc-the-economical-and-flexible-library-service-to-rent-and-read-books/|title=JustBooks CLC - Library Service to Rent and Read Books|website=thetechpanda.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are major national level players in Indian online book rental scenario.

== {{anchor|E-books vs physical books}}Electronic versus print books ==

There is speculation as to the survival of these ventures, as more people use [[Amazon Kindle]] and read books online. However, most book-lovers prefer a physical book, and this is the premise on which these new ventures are based. Their success remains to be seen; however, they offer a ray of hope for young professionals in the country who currently lack access to books. Apart from the metropolitan areas, most cities and towns in India do not have good, well-stocked [[public libraries]]. For the residents of these cities, such ventures may offer an economical way to bridge the gap.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">A [[book]] '''prospectus''' is a printed description of or [[advertisement]] for that book, usually issued before publication in an attempt to generate interest and advance orders. The word derives from Latin, meaning literally something which gives a view or prospect (in this case of a book). Some prospectuses are lavishly produced, especially for [[private press]] books.

Printed advertisements for and catalogues of books were produced in Europe as early as the 1470s, although very few survive and what we recognize today as prospectuses (containing information on the text, physical nature, price and availability of a forthcoming book) did not develop until the seventeenth century, when they were generally issued for books published by [[subscription]]. Prospectuses are of great interest to the historian and bibliographer because they often give information about a book, its author, publisher, printer or illustrator which is not available elsewhere.

The '''Sahitya Akademi''', [[India]]'s National Academy of Letters, is an organisation dedicated to the promotion of [[literature]] in the [[languages of India]].&lt;ref name=hota&gt;{{cite book|last=Hota|first=AK|title=Encyclopaedia of New Media and Educational Planning|year=2000|publisher=`|isbn=978-81-7625-170-9|pages=310–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1IW8UwPfzUC&amp;pg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded on 12 March 1954, it is supported by, though independent of, the Indian government. It is in Rabindra Bhavan near [[Mandi House]] in [[Delhi]].

The Sahitya Akademi organises national and regional workshops and seminars; provides research and travel grants to authors; publishes books and journals, including the Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature; and presents the annual [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] of Rs. 100,000 (approx. USD 1,500 (in year 2013)) in each of the 24 languages it supports, as well as the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] for lifetime achievement.

The Sahitya Akademi Library is one of the largest multi-lingual libraries in India, with a rich collection of books on literature and allied subjects.

It publishes two bimonthly literary journals: ''[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]'' in English and ''Samkaleen Bharatiya Sahitya'' in Hindi.&lt;ref name=hota/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academies: Sahitya Akademi|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/sahitya.php|work=[[Government of India]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==
The idea of constituting a National Academy of Letters in India was considered by the colonial British government, and in 1944 a proposal from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal for the formation of a 'National Cultural Trust' was, in principle, accepted. The original plan conceived of three institutions, or academies, devoted to the visual arts, performing arts, and letters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent Government of India carried out this proposal, constituting a National Academy of Letters, called the 'Sahitya Akademi' by a government resolution on 15 December 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first General Council of the Akademi included members such as [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]], [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[K. M. Panikkar|K.M. Panikkar]], [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K.M. Munshi]], [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Umashankar Joshi]], [[Mahadevi Varma]], [[D. V. Gundappa]], [[Ramdhari Singh Dinkar]], and was presided over by the then-Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Government of India clarified that the choice of Prime Minister Nehru as the first chairperson was "not because he is Prime Minister, but because he has carved out for himself a distinctive place as a writer and author."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Sahitya Akademi was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954 in New Delhi. A ceremony was held in the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]'s Central Hall, with speeches by Maulana [[Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]]. S. Radhakrishnan elaborated on the purpose of the Sahitya Akademi in his speech, noting that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phrase, Sahitya Akademi, combines two words. 'Sahitya' is Sanskrit, and 'Academy' is Greek. This name suggests our universal outlook and aspiration. Sahitya is a literary composition; Academy is an assembly of men who are interested in the subject. So Sahitya Akademi will be an assembly of all those who are interested in creative and critical literature. It is the purpose of this Akademi to recognise men of achievement in letters, to encourage men of promise in letters, to educate public taste and to improve standards of literature and literary criticism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A key concern in the early days of the Sahitya Akademi was the establishment of its autonomy from the Central Government. This concern was echoed by the Prime Minister, who noted that, "...it is an honour to be the President of an organisation which includes it in its fold the eminent writers of India in various languages. As President of that Akademi I may tell you quite frankly, I would not like the Prime Minister to interfere in my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Council made recommendations to amend the Akademi's governing constitution, including proposals to have the chairman elected by the Council and not appointed by the Government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these suggestions were incorporated, and the Akademi was constituted as a society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, as it had not originally been incorporated by an Act of Parliament, but by an executive order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Council was reconstituted and elected Prime Minister Nehru as its president, and he continued in that capacity until his death in 1964.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent presidents of the Sahitya Akademi have included [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]] (1958) who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after serving as the Vice-President along with him; [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]] (1963); [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Suniti Kumar Chatterjee]] (1967); [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar|K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar]] (1969, and re-elected in 1973); [[Umashankar Joshi]] (1978); [[Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya]] (1983); [[U. R.

The Akademi has never elected a female president although, in 2003, [[Mahasweta Devi]] unsuccessfully contested [[Gopi Chand Narang]] for the position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Constitution and structure ==
[[File:Sahitya Akademi Regional Office Banglore.jpg|thumb|Sahitya Akademi Regional Office at Banglore]]
The Sahitya Akademi was constituted by the Government of India by a resolution passed on 15 December 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/aboutus/the_constitution.jsp|title = The Constitution|date = |accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = Sahitya Akademi|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954.&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/aboutus/about.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi - About Us|date = |accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially functioned under executive order, but was subsequently registered as a society under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860.&lt;ref name="Sahitya Akademi - About Us"/&gt; The constitution of the Sahitya Akademi provides that it shall be run by three authorities — a General Council, an Executive Board, and a Finance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/aboutus/the_constitution.jsp|title = Constitution of the Sahitya Akademi, Section 5|date = |accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Council is empowered to elect a president and vice-president, from a panel of three candidates chosen by the Executive Board.&lt;ref name="sahitya-akademi.gov.in"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/aboutus/the_constitution.jsp|title = Constitution of the Sahitya Akademi, Section 4|date = |accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, the Executive Board appoints a secretary, who functions as both the Secretary of the Akademi and as ex-officio secretary of all three governing bodies.&lt;ref name="sahitya-akademi.gov.in"/&gt;

=== General Council ===

==== International seminars ====

The Sahitya Akademi periodically holds International Seminars, sometimes in collaboration with the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]]. The first international seminar was held in 1961, in New Delhi, to mark 100 years since the birth of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. About 25 writers from 16 countries, along with 39 writers from India met over four days to discuss and commemorate Tagore's works. Attendees included [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Martin Wickramasinghe|Martin Wickremesinghe]], [[Jean Guéhenno|Jean Guehenno]], [[Zaki Naguib Mahmoud]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], and [[Louis Untermeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Amrita Pritam]], Ramdhari Sinha Dinkar, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, and [[Premendra Mitra]]. In 1991, the Akademi organised a second International Seminar on Tagore in collaboration with the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] and the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]].

The Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 was also held in New Delhi and focused on the Ramayana tradition in Asia. Participants, including U Thein Han, Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi, presented 44 papers on Ramayana traditions, which were published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

International Seminars have since been held to mark the birth centenary of Hindi-language writer [[Premchand]], in 1981; to mark the birth centenary of Tamil-language poet [[Subramania Bharati|Subramania Bharti]] in 1983; on the [[Mahabharata]], in 1987; and on 'the Narrative' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Annual Festival of Letters ====
The Sahitya Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters is held in February and is the occasion at which the Akademi presents its [[Sahitya Akademi Award|awards]]. The festival is accompanied by an exhibition that covers major literary events of the previous year, as well as a 'Writers' Meet' which is a literary seminar spanning three days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Samvatsar Annual Lecture ====
The Samvatsar Annual Lecture is organised by the Sahitya Akademi and is delivered during the Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters. The Sahitya Akademi notes that these lectures "should open up new vistas of thinking regarding a literary movement, a current literary trend, some original thinking about a great writer or a great classic or a new path in literary criticism or literary creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi: Samvatsar Lectures|date = 26 November 2014|accessdate = |website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lectures have been delivered since 1986 by people including the Hindi writer [[Sachchidananda Vatsyayan]] (1986), Marathi poet and writer [[Vinda Karandikar]] (1991), Assamese novelist [[Nabakanta Barua]] (1994), and Malayalam author and director, [[M T Vasudevan Nair]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Samvatsar Lectures"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Samvatsar Lectures|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the lecture was delivered by [[Girish Karnad]], a Kannada playwright and author.&lt;ref name="Samvatsar Lectures"/&gt; The most recent lecture was delivered by Dr. [[Chandrashekhar Shankar Dharmadhikari]], an author, lawyer, and former judge in the [[Mumbai High Court|Bombay High Court]] on 17 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/pdf/press-release-12-02-16.pdf|title=Press Release|last=Sahitya Akademi|first=|date=12 February 2016|website=Sahitya Akademi|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===='Meet the Author' programmes====

The Sahitya Akademi organises regular public interactions with published Indian authors. These sessions, titled 'Meet the Author' consist of a 40-minute lecture by the invited author followed by an open session of questions and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/loka.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi: Loka, the Many Voices|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Meet the Author' programmes have been conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru.

To complement this, the Sahitya Akademi has held a parallel lecture series titled 'Men in Books' in which the Akademi invites persons distinguished for interdisciplinary studies to speak about literature. Notable speakers in the past have included film-maker [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], journalist Dilip Padgaonkar, lawyer [[Laxmi Mall Singhvi]], and former Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/men_and_books.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi: Men and Books|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and Parliamentary Committee reviews ==

There have been widespread allegations of corruption and controversial appointments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Deepa|title=Sahitya Akademi in Ruins Literally|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sahitya-academy-in-ruins-literally/12569-3-1.html|work=IBN Live|date=9 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the Presidency of [[Gopi Chand Narang]] who headed Sahitya Akademi from 2003 to 2007 and the current President Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?230676 |title=Bibliofile |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140059/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?230676 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?223217 |title=Bibliofile |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140047/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?223217 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrahara Krishnamurthy, appointed as the Secretary of Sahitya Akademi by Narang, had undergone a CBI probe in a paper purchase scam at the time of his appointment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?231485 |title=War And No Peace |website=Outlookindia.com |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924140101/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?231485 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was censured and forced to retire after being accused of financial irregularities in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/274600/probe-against-agrahara.html |title=Probe against Agrahara |website=Deccanherald.com |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-stays-penalty-imposed-on-poet/article6190727.ece |title=HC stays penalty imposed on poet |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agrahara Krishnamurthy who has been granted relief by the High Court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nandakumar|first1=Pratibha|title=Truth prevails|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/lounge/Truth-prevails/articleshow/38998241.cms|work=Bangalore Mirror|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has alleged a conspiracy against him by a cabal of writers and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conspiracy behind my ouster: Agrahara Krishnamurthy|url=http://mathrubhuminews.in/ee/ReadMore/8251/conspiracy-behind-ousting-agrahara-krishnamoorthy/E|work=Matrubhumi News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment by a committee composed of Narang, Tiwari and others of the current Secretary K. Sreenivasa Rao, is controversial as Rao’s academic credentials for the top job, who had joined the Akademi as a lower division clerk (LDC), are said to be insufficient and extremely dubious.

The 171st Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of Sahitya Akademi and three other institutions chaired by [[Sitaram Yechury]] and tabled at the [[Loksabha]] in August 2011 states, "It was felt that most of these institutions were not able to live up to the original mandates set out by their founding fathers. Controversies of different kind involving these institutions that keep cropping up from time to time, had caught this Committee’s attention. Questions were also raised about the indifference and helplessness shown by the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]] to do anything in the face of autonomy enjoyed by these institutions."

The Committee also urged Sahitya Akademi to adopt the recommendation of the [[P. N. Haksar|Haksar]] Committee (1988) of having its head appointed by the President of India, a practice followed by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|Sangeet Natak]] and [[Lalit Kala Akademi|Lalit Kala]] Akademies, to avoid "the inevitable complications of the existing system of elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=171st Report of Parliamentary Committee|url=http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat, New Delhi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084016/http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial appointments ===

Many controversial appointments of unqualified candidates to key positions at the Sahitya Akademi, done during [[Gopi Chand Narang]]'s time, continue unchallenged to this day. Khurshid Alam and Mrignayani Gupta, both dismissed in 2004 for presenting counterfeit degree certificates, have made a backdoor entry and have been subsequently promoted to higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Mihir|title=Scam charges cloud Sahitya Akademi|url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|agency=Tehelka|date=30 October 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115454/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been widespread allegations in the Hindi press that the certificates of the current secretary, K. Sreenivasa Rao, who completed his M.Phil and PhD degrees while being employed as Deputy Secretary (Administration) at the Sahitya Akademi without availing a single day's leave, are fake and fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thakur|first1=Sunderchand|title=साहित्य अकादमी में फिर विवादास्पद नियुक्ति|url=http://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1535663.cms|agency=Nav Bharat Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals by the writers community to the Ministry of Culture to launch an inquiry have not yielded any result.

=== Sahitya Akademi Awards controversy ===

It has been alleged time and again that the procedure of nomination of litterateurs for the coveted [[Sahitya Akademi Award]]s is not transparent. The ground-list of books (from which the jury members make two short-lists and the final selection for the award) is supposed to be made by the General Council. But the books are provided to this council by the bureaucrats and employees of the Akademi who are allegedly unqualified to make any kind of literary selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Y.P. Rajesh|first1=Amit Prakash,|title=The Literary Mafia|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/The-Literary-Mafia/200102|work=Outlook Magazine|date=1 Nov 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the award regulations makes the recommendations of the Language Advisory Board mandatory, the recommendations of the board are often dismissed and ignored by the officials without citing any reason. This lack of transparency and rigour in the selection process has resulted in a lot of controversy. It has even resulted in writers being forced to return the award when it has been proven that the selection procedure was fraudulent, as was the case with the Sahitya Akademi award for a translation into [[Oriya language|Oriya]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Probe sought into Sahitya Akademi affairs|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/probe-sought-into-sahitya-akademi-affairs/article728959.ece|work=The Hindu|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer's plan to return Sahitya Akademi award sparks row|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/writers-plan-to-return-sahitya-akademi-award-sparks-row/article581860.ece|work=The Hindu|date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahitya Akademi is also highly criticized by writers such as [[Khushwant Singh]] for ignoring eminent writers and awarding below-par writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Khushwant|title=Prize manipulators: Sahitya Akademi under fire for awarding 'below par' authors|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/controversy-over-the-1991-sahitya-akademis-choice-of-author-exposes-its-flawed-functioning/1/308420.html|work=India Today|date=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sub-standard literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mrunalini|first1=C|title=Draupadi’s unending circle of suffering|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/article225606.ece?service=print|work=The New Indian Express|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lulla|first1=Anil Budur|title=Disrobing Draupadi|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/disrobing-draupadi|work=Open Magazine|date=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Bernardino Altarpiece''' is a 1521 oil on canvas painting by [[Lorenzo Lotto]], named after the chapel on Via Pignolo in [[Bergamo]], for which it was commissioned by the 'Disciplinati', a lay confraternity. It still hangs in its original position. Lotto also worked on the [[Santo Spirito Altarpiece]] at around the same time for the church of Santo Spirito in Bergamo.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta D'Adda, ''Lotto'', Skira, Milano 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is signed and dated "LLotus / M D XXI" on the lowest step in the centre&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Pirovano, ''Lotto'', Electa, Milano 2002. {{ISBN|88-435-7550-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lotto may have been inspired by [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Madonna of the Baldacchino]]'', which he could have seen on his 1510 trip to Florence, and [[Giovanni Cariani]]'s 1517 [[San Gottardo Altarpiece]] in the church of that name in Bergamo.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta D'Adda, Lotto, Skira, Milano 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Pedro Art Association''', established in 1936, is an art association set within the Los Angeles Harbor community of California. It has a history of established and well known artists dating back to its inception. Through exhibitions and public lectures, it encouraged works beyond representational art, and included figurative and abstract expressionist paintings in the 1950s. Though it originally exhibited primarily watercolor and oil paintings, the association evolved to include various other mediums and art forms.

== History ==
The San Pedro Art Association (SPAA) was established in 1936 in [[San Pedro, California]].  The original members' goals focused on expanding art in San Pedro and its surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Association Beginnings|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=2 September 1948|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association was formed by local artists in the community and it held seasonal art shows and exhibitions that were juried by established professionals and awarded artists in both [[oil painting]] and [[watercolor]] mediums.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Gallery Opens Today|newspaper=Independent Press Telegram, Long Beach, CA|date=22 March 1953|page=B-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|title=250 Attend New Art Gallery Opening in Plaza Park Building|newspaper=San Pedro News Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=23 March 1952|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|title=Permanent Art Gallery|newspaper=San Pedro News Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=March 25, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPAA has historically sponsored cultural art exchanges with artists outside the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan American Exchange Exhibitionto be Shown|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=Aug 10, 1949|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Exhibit of Foreign Art at San Pedro Slated Tomorrow|newspaper=Long Beach Press Telegram, Long Beach, CA|date=Aug 11, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazilian Painting at SP Art Show|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, CA|date=Nov 6, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; this tradition continues through current exhibitions.  Since then, the association has expanded and is known for bringing local artists together with varied art forms that include painting, photography, sculpture, ceramics, woodworking and jewelry making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|title=San Pedro: A Different Kind of Burgeoning Art Scene|newspaper=LA Weekly, Los Angeles, CA|date=Jan 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions continue to be presented seasonally and are open to the public.

In 1953, under the direction of its President [[Jay Meuser]], the San Pedro Art Association wrote many of its bylaws and became a non-profit corporation providing a structure for the future growth of its membership and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City of Los Angeles|newspaper=Resolution for the San Pedro Art Association on the Occasion of its 75th Anniversary|date=Sep 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the significant stated goals that continue to be utilized and implemented are:
* To further the mutual inspiration and development of its members by seeking to stimulate their interest in this organization and to encourage them in their own particular line of work.
* To promote means and opportunities for the education of the public with respect to art activities within the community.
* To enlarge and intensify the interest of its members in the artistic, cultural, and educational affairs of the community for its betterment by contributing to and encouraging art activities within the community.
These established goals of enriching the community through art were significant and continue today as an important function of the foundation for the organization and its membership.  The San Pedro Art Association is responsible for art lectures and demonstrations by local and other prominent artists as well as providing community events and monthly artwalks of galleries in historical downtown San Pedro.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Downtown SP on the Upswing|newspaper=Daily Breeze, Torrance, CA|date=May 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the San Pedro Art Association had its 75th anniversary celebration and exhibition.  Under the leadership of the association's president John Stinson, San Pedro Art Association was presented with certificates of recognition by the Los Angeles City and County as well as the State of California.&lt;ref name="Knabe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Knabe Commemorates San Pedro Art Association's 75th Anniversary |url=http://sanpedronewspilot.com/profiles/blogs/knabe-commemorates-san-pedro-art-association-s-75th-anniversary |newspaper=San Pedro News Pilot |first=Don |last=Knabe |date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">The '''Symphony No. 4''' is the fourth [[symphony]] by the Scottish composer [[James MacMillan]].  The work was composed in celebration of the conductor [[Donald Runnicles]]'s 60th birthday.  It was premiered at [[The Proms]] on August 3, 2015 by the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] under Donald Runnicles.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=MacMillan |first=James |authorlink=James MacMillan |year=2015 |title=MacMillan, James: Symphony No. 4 |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/James-MacMillan-Symphony-No-4/58307 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ashley |first=Tim |title=BBCSSO/Runnicles review – MacMillan premiere and the raw power of Mahler |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 August 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/04/bbcsso-runnicles-review-prom-24-macmillan-mahler |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 37 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;  Though MacMillan had conceived the symphony years earlier, he did not begin work on the piece until late 2014.  The work quotes passages from ''Missa Dum Sacrum Mysterium'' by the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance composer]] [[Robert Carver (composer)|Robert Carver]].  MacMillan described the use of Carver's work in an interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'', remarking, "He's been such a big figure in my adult life as a composer in Scotland, and I've always wanted to acknowledge some kind of debt. I love the austerity of his music, but also its complexity. I've incorporated some of his ideas into the structure of the symphony and wound my own music around it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kettle |first=David |title=Classical: Sir James MacMillan’s Symphony No.4 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=22 July 2015 |url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/classical-sir-james-macmillan-s-symphony-no-4-1-3837526#axzz3qUyvDHPW |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (2nd doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s (2nd doubling [[cor anglais]]), two [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), [[bassoon]], [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere, Tim Ashley of ''[[The Guardian]]'' lauded the piece, writing:{{quote|Lasting around 40 minutes, the symphony is effectively a single-movement variant on traditional sonata form built round a cluster of ideas heard in succession at the outset: ritualistic timpani throbs; a fanfare-like chorale; thickening string dissonances; and spiky, aggressive rhythmic figurations from woodwind and piano. Carver's Mass is then introduced by low solo strings, and the development weaves its way through and over it, the textures alternately clotting and clearing, the mood turning increasingly tense.

Eventually serenity is achieved in a slowly unwinding cello melody accompanied by the exquisite yet eerie sound of overtones on eastern temple bowls. At this point, the emotional trajectory feels complete. But MacMillan pushes on to a big coda, complete with a series of grandiose climaxes that feel curiously forced after all that has gone before. Densely, at times exotically scored, it was grandly played. Runnicles conducted it with great affection and dignity.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;}}
The work was also praised by David Nice of ''[[The Arts Desk]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nice |first=David |title=Prom 24: BBCSSO, Runnicles |work=[[The Arts Desk]] |date=4 August 2015 |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-24-bbcsso-runnicles-0 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Trend of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trend |first=Nick |title=Proms 2015: Prom 24, James MacMillan and Mahler, review 'beautifully played' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=4 August 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/proms-2015-prom-24-bbc-scottish-symphony-orchestra-review/ |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Cummings of ''5:4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cummings |first=Simon |title=Proms 2015: Colin Matthews – String Quartet No. 5 (European Première) &amp; James MacMillan – Symphony No. 4 (World Première) |work=5:4 |date=14 August 2015 |url=http://5against4.com/2015/08/14/proms-2015-colin-matthews-string-quartet-no-5-european-premiere-james-macmillan-symphony-no-4-world-premiere/ |accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No. 9''' is [[Philip Glass]]'s ninth symphony. It was written between 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; It is written in 3 movements.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The work was jointly commissioned by the [[Bruckner Orchester Linz]], [[Carnegie Hall]], and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Association]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

The symphony premiered January 1, 2012 at [[Brucknerhaus]] in [[Linz]], [[Austria]], with the [[Bruckner Orchester Linz]] conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;  The piece received its [[United States]] premiere January 31, 2012 at [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Dennis Russell Davies]] conducting the [[American Composers Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; It premiered on the West Coast April 5, 2012, with [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] conducting the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been highly regarded by critics and quickly became a bestseller on [[iTunes]] following its U.S. premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=James C. |title=Philip Glass, 75, has an iTunes hit with his Ninth Symphony |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 2, 2012 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/philip-glass-75-has-an-itunes-hit-with-his-ninth-symphony.html |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Swed of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' lauded the work, declaring it "late Glass at his most momentous, a significant symphony by America’s most significant symphonist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swed |first=Mark |title=Music review: The L.A.

Ginell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the work, saying, "The 50-minute-plus Ninth is not Glass’s biggest symphony – that would be the 97-minute, choral [[Symphony No. 5 (Glass)|Fifth]] – but it is one of his more imposing pieces, three sprawling movements for a very large symphony orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ginell |first=Richard S. |title=Review: ‘Philip Glass: Symphony No. 9’ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 7, 2012 |url=https://variety.com/2012/music/reviews/philip-glass-symphony-no-9-1117947357/ |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was slightly more critical, but commended the work, noting, "If the music occasionally hangs fire, its craftsmanship, as ever with Glass, is exemplary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clements |first=Andrew |title=Glass: Symphony No 9 – review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 14, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/14/glass-symphony-9-davies-review |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">The '''Secret of the Way Things Are''' (also called the '''Sapiential Work Scroll''') is considered a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom scroll]] among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. It is authored by a spiritual expert, directed towards a beginner. The author addresses how to deal with business and money issues in a godly manner, public affairs, leadership, marriage, children, and family, and how to live life righteously among secular society. The scrolls were found in [[Qumran]] caves one and four, and date approximately from the first century BCE and early first century CE.

==Description== 
Parts of six copies were discovered, indicating popularity and importance, especially to the supposed sect at Qumran. All of the Sapiential manuscripts are in [[Hebrew]], which is deemed the original language of the text (Harrington 2000: 825). The actual ancient title is unknown, but the frequent use of ''raz nihyeh'', translating to "the mystery of existence," "approaching mystery," or "the way things are" gave reason to title the work "The Secret of the Way Things are" (Davies, Brooke, and Callaway 2002: 140). A well-accepted theory is that the Sapiential Work was a pre-Qumranic text. In other words, it was not written for an isolated sect, but it ''was'' directed toward a specific audience (Elgvin 1996: 129). Many scholars assume the text to either have existed before the formation of the sect, or to have been a precursor to sect involvement (Harrington 2000: 826).

==Motifs==
Although the text itself is not considered [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and does not reflect the developed philosophical dualism of the [[War Rule|War Scroll]] or the [[Community Rule]] (1Qs), the text does reflect [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s of the [[end time]]s, judgment, and a predestined division of good and evil. The overall ideas and form of the text are comparable to [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], Jesus' instructions and parables in the [[New Testament]] gospels, the [[book of James]], and especially the [[book of Daniel]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Parallels==
Although there is no literal dependence between Daniel and the Sapiential Works, it is likely that they emerged from the same, or similar, scribal circles. Many phrases and ideas from Daniel pertaining to wisdom, revelation, and the elect recur in "The Secret of the Way Things Are." Similarly, both books reflect scribal activity with "a quest for divine communication," and "neither are concerned with the sacrificial cult of the Temple" (Elgvin 1996 : 131). The Work is also analogous to New Testament scripture, with recurring similarities found in Proverbs and the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Although the terminology is not consistently parallel, the ideas and themes are comparable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Women==
An unusual aspect of this particular text is that it addresses women, which is very uncommon for an ancient Jewish text. 4Q413 appears to give advice to a woman, presumably the wife of the beginner being instructed (Harrington 2000: 826). This particular section uses feminine verbal forms, rather than the singular forms used throughout the rest of the instruction (Harrington 1996: 57).

'''Watermans Art Centre''' is a multipurpose [[arts centre]]. It is located in [[Brentford]], England alongside the banks of the [[River Thames]] overlooking [[Kew Gardens]] in west London, England.

It includes a 239-seat theatre and a 125-seat [[movie theatre|cinema]].{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
===Building===
Built on the site of [[gas works]], Watermans Arts Centre was in planning for 15 years.{{fact|date=October 2016}} A trust was put in place in 1975 and there was a fundraising drive. The Hounslow Arts Trust managed to raise around £150,000 but it was not enough to build the centre. A planning deal was made with the developer of offices adjoining the current site which, along with the Trust's money, paid for the construction. It took about three years to build and cost about £2m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/keepwatermansinbrentford/watermans-history-1 |title=Watermans' history – Keep Watermans in Brentford |publisher=Google |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by the architectural firm Oscar Garry &amp; Partners. The original building contained a theatre, cinema, and gallery. The two studios are a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/25877 |title=Watermans Arts Centre in Brentford, GB |publisher=Cinema Treasures |date=7 January 2001 |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Baraldi was the first director of the arts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-baraldi-6460b160|title=John Baraldi |website=''Linkedin.com''|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The first event in the theatre was a concert by sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watermans.org.uk/about/watermans/our-approach/history.aspx |title=Watermans – History |website=Web.archive.org |date=29 October 2014 |accessdate=31 October 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029185313/http://www.watermans.org.uk/about/watermans/our-approach/history.aspx |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watermans established a reputation for live music and early raves took place there. In fact, the term [[Acid Jazz]] was originally coined by DJ [[Gilles Peterson]] at one of Nicky Holloway's Special Branch gigs at the Watermans in late 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Acid Jazz – Steve Bunyan, Marc Lessner.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilles Peterson recollected that "Acid jazz happened when Bangsy and me were playing at the Waterman's Art Centre in Brentford. A one-off gig by Nicky Holloway. I think [[Paul Oakenfold]] or [[Pete Tong]] were DJing. It was all ‘get on one, matey’ and it was banging acid house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djhistory.com/interviews/gilles-peterson |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324015920/http://www.djhistory.com/interviews/gilles-peterson |archivedate=24 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 1988, alternative rock band [[Spacemen 3]] gave an unusual live performance. ''An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music'' took place in the foyer to act as a prelude to a screening of the film Wings of Desire. Peter Kember, Jason Pierce and Will Carruthers were joined by Rugby musician Steve Evans. They played a 45-minute jam, based around a single chord strummed by Evans, featuring riffs from some of the songs from their as yet unreleased ''[[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|Playing with Fire]]'' material. This performance was recorded and was later released, in 1990, as ''[[Dreamweapon]]''.

The performance was not well received at the time. Pat Fish said "it was fucking beautiful, but in this setting it was really, really annoying people. It was quite loud in the room... tempers were beginning to fray."&lt;ref&gt;''Spacemen 3 and the Birth of Spiritualized'', Erik Morse, 2004, [[Omnibus Press]], {{ISBN|978-0711996021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
[[Robert Rankin]] held a position as the [[Writer in Residence]] of Watermans during the 1980s and organised a regular poetry event which he claims was the largest in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghamwriters.org/?p=77 |title=Birmingham Science Fiction Group to host Robert Rankin 8th April " Birmingham Writers’ Group |website=''Birminghamwriters.org'' |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankin's ''[[The Brentford Trilogy]]'' is a series of nine novels humorously chronicling the lives of a couple of drunken middle-aged layabouts who confront the forces of darkness in [[Brentford]].

In that decade. there were several reported sightings of a [[Griffin]] near Watermans. John Baraldi reported that "a woman came from the parking along the street. She was in an awful state. She had seen a huge bird and was obviously rather shaken by it." Robert Rankin said "it has been a local myth for years. There were sightings of the ones prior to the last year. Previous ones go back to at least before the [[Second World War]]. A year ago a jogger called John Olssen reported seeing the bird as he was running by the arts centre. And a woman saw it from the top of a bus."&lt;ref&gt;''London Urban Legends: The Corpse on the Tube and Other Stories'', Scott Wood, The History Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0752482873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend went on to be referenced in Rankin's book ''[[Web Site Story]]''.

===Asian-British arts===
During the 1990s, Watermans was known for focusing on South Asian arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Rampton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy-1200064.html |title=Comedy |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Alda Terracciano argued that "the last decade has witnessed the rapidly increasing achievements of a number of [[British Asian]] playwrights, directors and actors – a trend fostered by the support of venues such as the Watermans Arts Centre," noting that the comedy circuit benefited from Watermans' support through the regular 'One Nation Under a Groove...Innit' event which "offered the opportunity to a number of emerging Asian comedians to exercise their skills before being cast in proper comedy dramas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sadaa.co.uk/studio/files/South-Asian-Theatre-in-Britain.pdf |format=PDF |title=South Asian Theatre in Britain |author=Dr. Alda Terracciano |website=''Sadaa.co.uk'' |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]]'s musical comedy double act "The Secret Indians (non-Asian)" performed extensively at Watermans.

===Other performers===
Comedian [[Jo Brand]] visited in 2008. She said of Watermans that "these sort of places are important for local people in west London. You have the West End but the average person cannot afford that, so their only access to theatre is somewhere like Watermans." She also noted: "I was in a stand-up show there about 20 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/brand-throws-weight-behind-watermans-6020055 |title=Brand throws weight behind Watermans |publisher=Get West London |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable names who have appeared include [[Peter Greenaway]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Mica Paris]], [[Meera Syal]], [[Melvin Bragg]] and [[Shabana Azmi]].

==Present==
[[File:Inside the Watermans' Arts Centre, Brentford - London..jpg|thumb|Art in Watermans Art Centre in 2014]]
Watermans provides a year-round programme for children, a new media art gallery and a creative space for the community. Watermans currently brings art shows to [[Bell Square]], an outdoor arts venue in [[Hounslow]] Town Centre and have taken a leading role in Hounslow's Creative People and Places programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.watermans.org.uk/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Watermans |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===
The arts centre delivers an extensive learning and participation programme for young people which offers over 2,000 sessions per year with attendances of over 50,000. Programmes are typically focused on creative skills development, raising aspirations and introducing young people to creative employment opportunities. They were awarded the Social Enterprise mark and are an accredited ISO 9001 company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.watermans.org.uk/impact/ |title=Impact |publisher=Watermans |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Paul Crillon Barton00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]'''''&lt;br/&gt;by William Barton&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''William Paul Crillon Barton''' (November 17, 1786 – March 27, 1856), was a medical botanist, physician, professor, [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]], and botanical illustrator.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;{{cite AMB1920|wstitle=Barton, William Paul Crillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Barton was born on November 17, 1786, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His father [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]], a lawyer, was the designer of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. His uncle, [[Benjamin Smith Barton]] (1766–1815) was an eminent medical botanist and vice-president of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

===Education===

As was customary for the era, Barton pursued a classical education at [[Princeton University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1805.&lt;ref name=AMB /&gt;  The curriculum included Aristotelian logic, and study of the Greek and Latin languages. While he was at Princeton, each member of his class assumed the name of some celebrated man. The one he chose was [[:fr:Louis Antoine François de Paule Des Balbes de Berton de Crillon|Count Paul Crillon]], and the initials P. C. were retained by him the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Barton, Thomas|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton began studying medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in 1805 under his uncle, [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], who was a renowned botanist and author of the first American text book on botanical science. In these years of study, William Barton’s interest in [[botany]] and the natural sciences grew into a lifelong passion.

In 1808, upon publication of ''A Dissertation on Chymical Properties and Exhilarating Effects of Nitrous Oxide Gas and Its Application to Pneumatick Medicine'', Barton received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Complete with an illustration of a giddy man breathing in “laughing gas” from a sheep’s bladder, the treatise had great impact on scientific thought when nitrous oxide experiments were “generally derided as extravagant and imaginary.”&lt;ref&gt;Barton, WPC. A Dissertation on Chymical Properties and Exhilarating Effects of Nitrous Oxide Gas and Its Application to Pneumatick Medicine. Philadelphia: Lorenzo Pres, 1808: pages xiii–v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Naval Surgeon===

At the age of 23, Barton chose to enter the U.S. Navy as a surgeon.  He received his commission on April 10, 1809, and less than week later commissioned the famous Thomas Sully to paint his portrait for a sum of $50. This painting, now in the Wilstach Collection at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], shows a young Barton in uniform – a blue coat with gold braid, and hands gloved. Barton wrote, “I was overwhelmed with the difficulties I had to encounter in the performance of professional duties, where every species of inconvenience and disadvantage that can be imagined was opposed to the exertions of the surgeon.”&lt;ref&gt;Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed,  1814. page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Barton was not one to accept inadequacies, but rather to fight for reform. 
   
Barton fought to tighten the controls of shipboard medical supplies.  He called for the introduction of lemons and limes aboard Navy ships long before the U.S. Navy accepted the importance of an antiscorbutic treatment for vitamin C deficiency or scurvy.&lt;ref name="lemon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nODCOzu2n8C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=cutbush+navy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VQVOeAkgHl&amp;sig=XeKqVm_IICWJkOtje3Nft0vjBIo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OKgbTIbyO6TKM-LFqc4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=cutbush%20navy&amp;f=false|title=Vitamin C in health and disease|accessdate=2010-06-17|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton went as far as to send a bottle of lime juice to the Secretary of the Navy [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] with the instructions to drink it in the form of lemonade.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed, 1814. pages 147–155&lt;/ref&gt; His outspoken manner angered many of his colleagues. Barton, of necessity, became familiar with the administration of hospitals.

In February, 1811, Congress passed an act establishing naval hospitals. Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton later asked Barton to compose a set of regulations for governing these hospitals. Barton was well aware of the shortcomings in Navy medical care. Shipboard facilities were primitive, and there were no permanent hospitals ashore, only temporary facilities in Navy yards.&lt;ref name="proudly"&gt;{{cite book|title=Serving Proudly: A History of Women in the U.S. Navy|accessdate=2010-06-17|first=Susan H. |last=Godson|publisher=Naval Institute, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton began by drafting rules for governing naval hospitals. In 1812, the Navy Department submitted them to Congress. "Each hospital accommodating at least one hundred men should maintain a staff including a surgeon, who must be a college or university graduate; two surgeon's mates; a steward; a matron; a wardmaster; four permanent nurses; and a variety of servants."&lt;ref name="proudly"/&gt; Not satisfied with the hastily drafted suggestions, Barton expanded his theories in a treatise published in 1814.&lt;ref name="proudly"/&gt;

He was the first to promote the idea of employing female nurses in the U.S. Navy. He described the "matron's characteristics: she should be "discreet ... reputable ... capable ... neat, cleanly, and tidy in her dress, and urbane and tender in her deportment." She would supervise the nurses and other attendants as well as those working in the laundry, larder, and kitchen, but her main function was to ensure that patients were clean, well-fed, and comfortable.&lt;ref name="proudly"/&gt; [[File:Cutbush 1824-0611 edward.jpg|thumb|William Barton serves on naval board, June 11, 1824]]

By 1824, Barton served on the first board to examine candidates for the Navy's medical service.&lt;ref name="father"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BXB9QtUfFQC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=dr.+edward+cutbush&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HzDeWRj_u-&amp;sig=dDRlxqXPGg-6QaqH6FIthaIkmE4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IBQPTJe1GdDpnQeqnMG4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false
|title=Military medicine: from ancient times to the 21st century. |first=Jack Edward|last=McCallum |accessdate=2010-06-08|publisher=ABC-CLIO, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the board was to examine Surgeon's Mates, "preparatory to their promotion to the rank of Surgeons." The board was also authorized to examine applicants for Commissions as Surgeons' Mates and report upon their fitness.&lt;ref name="board"&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Board |newspaper=[[New York Spectator]] |location=New York, New York|date=June 11, 1824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 he became the commanding officer at Naval Hospital Norfolk, VA.  He was involved in the development of the Philadelphia Naval Hospital when it was located in the [[Naval Asylum]].  Today, this gothic structure, that also served as the first home of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], stands in [[Grays Ferry, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Grays Ferry]].

President [[John Tyler]] appointed Barton to the office of first head of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery on September 2, 1842. (The post of Navy Surgeon General was created in March 1871). His time as Chief clerk was active, but short.  Among his recommendations were the adoption of a supply table so that drugs and medical supplies could be properly procured and accounted for;  the abolition of a venereal fee;  uniform standards for recruits; higher professional standards for Navy physicians; standardizations and administrations of naval hospitals; and strict control over the use of liquor on board ships. He was a vehement prohibitionist,  and had a “liquor circular” pasted on boxes of whisky identifying the contents as medical supplies which required stringent accounting, a step which was not popular in the fleet.

===Treatise on U.S. Navy hospitals===

His ''A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy'' (1814) contained  recommendations of reform for the already new Navy hospital system. He urged that U.S. Navy hospitals should be modeled after British medical facilities. One of his many recommendations recommended that all hospital property should be marked “U.S. Naval Hospital” to prevent theft.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, WPC. A Treatise Containing a Plan for the Internal Organization and Government of Marine Hospitals in the United States: Together with A Scheme for Amending and Systematizing the Medical Department of the United States Navy. 1st ed. Philadelphia; privately printed, 1814. pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; The mere fact of the book having achieved a second edition three years later, is an indication of the estimation in which it was held. It contained a fund of information collected from various sources, both at home and abroad, and revealed an originality of thought and expression which stamped its author as far in advance of the times.&lt;ref&gt;Pleadwell, Frank L., Capt. "Edward Cutbush, M.D.: The Nestor of the Medical Corps of the Navy." Annals of Medical History 5 (1923): page 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania academics===

On the death of his uncle Benjamin Smith Barton in 1815, William Barton became professor of botany at the [[University of Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; and for years much of Barton’s time was dedicated to the teaching of [[Materia Medica]], or medical botany, at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] and [[Thomas Jefferson University|Thomas Jefferson Medical College]].  One of his prominent students was Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]], later immortalized in the [[Thomas Eakins]] painting ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1876). Gross portrayed his old teacher as a colorful character in a speech delivered to Alumni Association of [[Thomas Jefferson University|Thomas Jefferson Medical College]] on March 11, 1871.&lt;ref name=TJU/&gt;

From 1828–1829, Barton also served as the Dean of [[Jefferson Medical College]].&lt;ref name=TJU&gt;{{cite book|title=Part IV: University Components and Activities --- Chapter 49: The Medical College Deanship and Chapter 50: Hospital Administration (pages 850–888)|publisher=Thomas Jefferson University|pages=851|url=http://jdc.jefferson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=wagner2&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dwilliam%2520p.c.%2520barton%2520m.d.%25201807%2520university%2520of%2520pennsylvania%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D8%26ved%3D0CD8QFjAH%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fjdc.jefferson.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1039%2526context%253Dwagner2%26ei%3DvpjRTu3UN-b00gHpi9Qd%26usg%3DAFQjCNGTBCxJF1v8fr7CClyRH-aPcL9J8w#search=%22william%20p.c.%20barton%20m.d.%201807%20university%20pennsylvania%22|accessdate=November 27, 2011|chapter=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a fellow of the college of physicians in Philadelphia, president of the Linnaean Society, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, and other scientific societies.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;

===Personal life===

His brother was [[John Rhea Barton]] (1796–1871), the originator of corrective osteotomy for joint ankylosis. He invented both the "Barton bandage" (a figure eight bandage that provides support below and anterior to the lower jaw), and Barton forceps (obstetrical forceps with one fixed, curved blade and lunged anterior blade for application to a high transverse position of the head). The ''Barton Collection'' at [[Boston Public Library]] is named after Benjamin Smith Barton's son Thomas Pennant Barton (1803–1869), who was William Barton’s first cousin.  It comprises one of largest and most valuable Shakespeare collections in the world.

Barton was married to Esther Sergeant the grand daughter of [[David Rittenhouse]], the great American astronomer and President of the American Philosophical Society.  Esther Barton colored many of Dr. Barton’s botanical drawings.

He died on March 27, 1856 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=AMB /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYJM"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/details/newyorkjournalof3118forr | title=Death of Dr. Barton | journal=NY Jour Med | date=July  1856 | pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
In 1803, before his famous expedition, [[Meriwether Lewis]] went to Philadelphia and met with [[Benjamin Smith Barton]].  Barton helped to increase Lewis’ botanical knowledge and collection skills which obviously worked.  Lewis returned with 226 plants.  They are preserved today at the Lewis and Clark Herbarium at the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia.

The Philadelphia Botanical Club publishes a journal named after Dr. Barton called the Bartonia.  The publication publishes articles about original research in plant systematics, plant ecology, and plant conservation biology.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see [http://www.acnatsci.org/hosted/botany_club/bartonia.html Bartonia]&lt;/ref&gt;
